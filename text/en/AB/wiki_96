<text>Edmund Burke (; 12 January NS] 1729 – 9 July 1797) was an Anglo-Irish statesman and 
philosopher who spent most of his career in Great Britain. Born in Dublin, Burke served as a member of Parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons of Great Britain with the Whig Party. He is regarded as the philosophical founder of Conservatism.

Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state. These views were expressed in his &quot;A Vindication of Natural Society&quot; (1756). He criticised the actions of the British government towards the American colonies, including its taxation policies. Burke also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, although he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. He is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation, the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company, and his staunch opposition to the French Revolution.

In his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society and traditional institutions of state and society, and he condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party which he dubbed the Old Whigs as opposed to the pro-French Revolution New Whigs led by Charles James Fox.

In the 19th century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals. Subsequently, in the 20th century, he became widely regarded, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, as the philosophical founder of conservatism, along with his ultra-royalist and ultramontane counterpart Joseph de Maistre.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Dublin, Ireland. His mother Mary, &quot;née&quot; Nagle, was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a County Cork family and a cousin of the Catholic educator Nano Nagle, whereas his father Richard, a successful solicitor, was a member of the Church of Ireland. It remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burgh (Burke) dynasty descends from the Anglo-Norman knight, William de Burgh, who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II&#x27;s 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the &quot;chief Gall or Old English families that assimilated into Gaelic society&quot; (the surname de Burgh (Latinised as &quot;de Burgo&quot;) was gaelicised in Irish as &quot;de Búrca&quot; or &quot;Búrc&quot; which over the centuries became Burke).

Burke adhered to his father&#x27;s faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana, who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic. Later, his political enemies repeatedly accused him of having been educated at the Jesuit College of St. Omer, near Calais, France; and of harbouring secret Catholic sympathies at a time when membership in the Catholic Church would disqualify him from public office per Penal Laws in Ireland. As Burke told Frances Crewe:

Mr. Burke&#x27;s Enemies often endeavoured to convince the World that he had been bred up in the Catholic Faith, &amp; that his Family were of it, &amp; that he himself had been educated at St. Omer—but this was false, as his father was a regular practitioner of the Law at Dublin, which he could not be unless of the Established Church: &amp; it so happened that though Mr. B was twice at Paris, he never happened to go through the Town of St. Omer.

After being elected to the House of Commons, Burke took the required oath of allegiance and abjuration, the oath of supremacy and the declaration against transubstantiation.

As a child, Burke sometimes spent time away from the unhealthy air of Dublin with his mother&#x27;s family near Killavullen in the Blackwater Valley in County Cork. He received his early education at a Quaker school in Ballitore, County Kildare, some from Dublin; and possibly like his cousin Nano Nagle at a Hedge school near Killavullen. He remained in correspondence with his schoolmate from there, Mary Leadbeater, the daughter of the school&#x27;s owner, throughout his life.

In 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment which up until 1793 did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, Edmund Burke&#x27;s Club, which in 1770 merged with TCD&#x27;s Historical Club to form the College Historical Society, the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke&#x27;s Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke&#x27;s father wanted him to read Law and with this in mind, he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.

==Early writing==
The late Lord Bolingbroke&#x27;s &quot;Letters on the Study and Use of History&quot; was published in 1752 and his collected works appeared in 1754. This provoked Burke into writing his first published work, &quot;A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind&quot;, appearing in Spring 1756. Burke imitated Bolingbroke&#x27;s style and ideas in a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; of his arguments for deistic rationalism in order to demonstrate their absurdity.

Burke claimed that Bolingbroke&#x27;s arguments against revealed religion could apply to all social and civil institutions as well. Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton as well as others initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke&#x27;s quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.

Richard Hurd believed that Burke&#x27;s imitation was near-perfect and that this defeated his purpose, arguing that an ironist &quot;should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the &quot;ridicule&quot; shine through the Imitation. Whereas this &quot;Vindication&quot; is everywhere enforc&#x27;d, not only in the language, and on the principles of L. Bol., but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other&quot;. A minority of scholars have taken the position that in fact Burke did write the &quot;Vindication&quot; in earnest, later disowning it only for political reasons.

In 1757, Burke published a treatise on aesthetics titled &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; that attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant. It was his only purely philosophical work, completed in 1753. When asked by Sir Joshua Reynolds and French Laurence to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation.

On 25 February 1757, Burke signed a contract with Robert Dodsley to write a &quot;history of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne&quot;, its length being eighty quarto sheets (640 pages), nearly 400,000 words. It was to be submitted for publication by Christmas 1758. Burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped; it was not published until after Burke&#x27;s death, in an 1812 collection of his works, &quot;An Essay Towards an Abridgement of the English History&quot;. G. M. Young did not value Burke&#x27;s history and claimed that it was &quot;demonstrably a translation from the French&quot;. On commenting on the story that Burke stopped his history because David Hume published his, Lord Acton said &quot;it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur&quot;.

During the year following that contract, Burke founded with Dodsley the influential &quot;Annual Register&quot;, a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year. The extent to which Burke contributed to the &quot;Annual Register&quot; is unclear. In his biography of Burke, Robert Murray quotes the &quot;Register&quot; as evidence of Burke&#x27;s opinions, yet Philip Magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference. Burke remained the chief editor of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766.

On 12 March 1757, Burke married Jane Mary Nugent (1734–1812), daughter of Dr. Christopher Nugent, a Catholic physician who had provided him with medical treatment at Bath. Their son Richard was born on 9 February 1758 while a second son, Christopher (born that December), died in infancy. Burke also helped raise a ward, Edmund Nagle (later Admiral Sir Edmund Nagle), the son of a maternal cousin orphaned in 1763.

At about this same time, Burke was introduced to William Gerard Hamilton (known as &quot;Single-speech Hamilton&quot;). When Hamilton was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his private secretary, a position he held for three years. In 1765, Burke became private secretary to the liberal Whig politician Charles, Marquess of Rockingham, then Prime Minister of Great Britain, who remained Burke&#x27;s close friend and associate until his death in 1782.

==Member of Parliament==

In December 1765, Burke entered the House of Commons of the British Parliament as Member for Wendover in Buckinghamshire, a pocket borough in the gift of Lord Fermanagh, later 2nd Earl Verney and a close political ally of Rockingham. After Burke delivered his maiden speech, William Pitt the Elder said he had &quot;spoken in such a manner as to stop the mouths of all Europe&quot; and that the Commons should congratulate itself on acquiring such a Member.

The first great subject Burke addressed was the controversy with the American colonies which soon developed into war and ultimate separation. In reply to the 1769 Grenvillite pamphlet &quot;The Present State of the Nation&quot;, he published his own pamphlet titled &quot;Observations on a Late State of the Nation&quot;. Surveying the finances of France, Burke predicts &quot;some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system&quot;.

During the same year, with mostly borrowed money, Burke purchased Gregories, a estate near Beaconsfield. Although the estate included saleable assets such as art works by Titian, Gregories proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full. His speeches and writings, having made him famous, led to the suggestion that he was the author of the &quot;Letters of Junius&quot;.

At about this time, Burke joined the circle of leading intellectuals and artists in London of whom Samuel Johnson was the central luminary. This circle also included David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith and Joshua Reynolds. Edward Gibbon described Burke as &quot;the most eloquent and rational madman that I ever knew&quot;. Although Johnson admired Burke&#x27;s brilliance, he found him a dishonest politician.

Burke took a leading role in the debate regarding the constitutional limits to the executive authority of the king. He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses, either by the monarch or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his &quot;Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents&quot; of 23 April 1770. Burke identified the &quot;discontents&quot; as stemming from the &quot;secret influence&quot; of a neo-Tory group he labelled as the &quot;king&#x27;s friends&quot;, whose system &quot;comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, &quot;Double Cabinet&quot;&quot;. Britain needed a party with &quot;an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, against every allurement of interest&quot;. Party divisions, &quot;whether operating for good or evil, are things inseparable from free government&quot;.
During 1771, Burke wrote a bill that would have given juries the right to determine what was libel, if passed. Burke spoke in favour of the bill, but it was opposed by some, including Charles James Fox, not becoming law. When introducing his own bill in 1791 in opposition, Fox repeated almost verbatim the text of Burke&#x27;s bill without acknowledgement. Burke was prominent in securing the right to publish debates held in Parliament.

Speaking in a Parliamentary debate on the prohibition on the export of grain on 16 November 1770, Burke argued in favour of a free market in corn: &quot;There are no such things as a high, &amp; a low price that is encouraging, &amp; discouraging; there is nothing but a natural price, which grain brings at an universal market&quot;. In 1772, Burke was instrumental in the passing of the Repeal of Certain Laws Act 1772 which repealed various old laws against dealers and forestallers in corn.

In the &quot;Annual Register&quot; for 1772 (published in July 1773), Burke condemned the partition of Poland. He saw it as &quot;the first very great breach in the modern political system of Europe&quot; and as upsetting the balance of power in Europe.

On 3 November 1774, Burke was elected Member for Bristol, at the time &quot;England&#x27;s second city&quot; with a large constituency in a genuine electoral contest. At the conclusion of the poll, he made his &quot;Speech to the Electors of Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll&quot;, a remarkable disclaimer of the constituent-imperative form of democracy, for which he substituted his statement of the &quot;representative mandate&quot; form. He failed to win re-election for that seat in the subsequent 1780 general election.

In May 1778, Burke supported a Parliamentary motion revising restrictions on Irish trade. His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, urged Burke to oppose free trade with Ireland. Burke resisted their protestations and said: &quot;If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong.&quot;

Burke published &quot;Two Letters to Gentlemen of Bristol on the Bills relative to the Trade of Ireland&quot; in which he espoused &quot;some of the chief principles of commerce; such as the advantage of free intercourse between all parts of the same kingdom ... the evils attending restriction and monopoly ... and that the gain of others is not necessarily our loss, but on the contrary an advantage by causing a greater demand for such wares as we have for sale.&quot;

Burke also supported the attempts of Sir George Savile to repeal some of the penal laws against Catholics. Burke also called capital punishment &quot;the Butchery which we call justice&quot; in 1776 and in 1780 condemned the use of the pillory for two men convicted for attempting to practice sodomy.

This support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and Catholic emancipation, led to Burke losing his seat in 1780. For the remainder of his Parliamentary career, Burke represented Malton, another pocket borough under the Marquess of Rockingham&#x27;s patronage.

==American War of Independence==
Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the American Thirteen Colonies under the government of King George III and his appointed representatives. On 19 April 1774, Burke made a speech, &quot;On American Taxation&quot; (published in January 1775), on a motion to repeal the tea duty:

On 22 March 1775, Burke delivered in the House of Commons a speech (published in May 1775) on reconciliation with America. Burke appealed for peace as preferable to civil war and reminded the House of Commons of America&#x27;s growing population, its industry and its wealth. He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force since most Americans were of British descent:

[T]he people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants ... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it ... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.

Burke prized peace with America above all else, pleading with the House of Commons to remember that the interest by way of money received from the American colonies was far more attractive than any sense of putting the colonists in their place:

The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord ... [I]t is simple peace, sought in its natural course and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.

Burke was not merely presenting a peace agreement to Parliament, but rather he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in Colonial America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. &quot;An armament,&quot; Burke said, &quot;is not a victory.&quot; Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment, stating that it would do the British government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience, as the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic—the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.

It was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the primary reason for avoiding war with the American colonies. Rather, it was the character of the American people themselves: &quot;In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole ... [T]his fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth ... [The] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of resources.&quot; Burke concludes with another plea for peace and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which in Burke&#x27;s words &quot;may bring on the destruction of this Empire.&quot;

Burke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:
# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, settling the dispute about taxation without representation.
# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused.
# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates.
# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes.
# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law) and start gathering them only when they are needed.
# Grant needed aid to the colonies.

Had they been passed, though the effect of these resolutions can never be known, they might have quelled the colonials&#x27; revolutionary spirit. Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington. As these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to prevent armed conflict.

Among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on Lord Bathurst (1684–1775) in which Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: &quot;Young man, There is America—which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world.&quot; Samuel Johnson was so irritated at hearing it continually praised that he made a parody of it, where the devil appears to a young Whig and predicts that in a short time Whiggism will poison even the paradise of America.

The administration of Lord North (1770–1782) tried to defeat the colonist rebellion by military force. British and American forces clashed in 1775 and in 1776 came the United States Declaration of Independence. Burke was appalled by celebrations in Britain of the defeat of the Americans in New York and Pennsylvania. He claimed the English national character was being changed by this authoritarianism. Burke wrote: &quot;As to the good people of England, they seem to partake every day more and more of the Character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate. I am satisfied, that within a few years there has been a great Change in the National Character. We seem no longer that eager, inquisitive, jealous, fiery people, which we have been formerly.&quot;

In Burke&#x27;s view, the British government was fighting &quot;the American English&quot; (&quot;our English Brethren in the Colonies&quot;), with a Germanic king employing &quot;the hireling sword of German boors and vassals&quot; to destroy the English liberties of the colonists. On American independence, Burke wrote: &quot;I do not know how to wish success to those whose Victory is to separate from us a large and noble part of our Empire. Still less do I wish success to injustice, oppression and absurdity.&quot;

During the Gordon Riots in 1780, Burke became a target of hostility and his home was placed under armed guard by the military.

==Paymaster of the Forces==

The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed Paymaster of the Forces and a Privy Counsellor, but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham&#x27;s unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister put an end to his administration after only a few months, but Burke did manage to introduce two Acts.

The Paymaster General Act 1782 ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Instead, now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster&#x27;s balance at the Bank. This Act was repealed by Shelburne&#x27;s administration, but the Act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.

The Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 was a watered-down version of Burke&#x27;s original intentions as outlined in his famous &quot;Speech on Economical Reform&quot; of 11 February 1780. However, he managed to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration. The third Secretary of State and the Board of Trade were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save £72,368 a year.

In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne&#x27;s government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783 and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of William Pitt the Younger which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life.

==Representative government==
In 1774, Burke&#x27;s &quot;Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll&quot; was noted for its defence of the principles of representative government against the notion that those elected to assemblies like Parliament are, or should be, merely delegates:

Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any sett of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your Representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.My worthy Colleague says, his Will ought to be subservient to yours. If that be all, the thing is innocent. If Government were a matter of Will upon any side, yours, without question, ought to be superior. But Government and Legislation are matters of reason and judgement, and not of inclination; and, what sort of reason is that, in which the determination precedes the discussion; in which one sett of men deliberate, and another decide; and where those who form the conclusion are perhaps three hundred miles distant from those who hear the arguments?To deliver an opinion is the right of all men; that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion which a Representative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always most seriously to consider. But &quot;authoritative&quot; instructions; &quot;mandates&quot; issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience; these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenour of our constitution.Parliament is not a &quot;congress&quot; of ambassadors from different and hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a &quot;deliberative&quot; assembly of &quot;one&quot; nation, with &quot;one&quot; interest, that of the whole; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole. You choose a member, indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of &quot;Parliament&quot;.

It is often forgotten in this connection that Burke, as detailed below, was an opponent of slavery, and therefore his conscience was refusing to support a trade in which many of his Bristol electors were lucratively involved.

Political scientist Hanna Pitkin points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining: &quot;Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve&quot;.

Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues, fearing that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.

==Opposition to the slave trade==
Burke proposed a bill to ban slaveholders from being able to sit in the House of Commons, claiming they were a danger incompatible with traditional notions of English liberty. He described slavery as a &quot;weed that grows on every soil. While Burke did believe that Africans were &quot;barbaric&quot; and needed to be &quot;civilised&quot; by Christianity, Gregory Collins argues that this was not an unusual attitude amongst abolitionists at the time. Furthermore, Burke seemed to believe that Christianity would provide a civilising benefit to any group of people, as he believed Christianity had &quot;tamed&quot; European civilisation and regarded Southern European peoples as equally savage and barbarous. Collins also suggests that Burke viewed the &quot;uncivilised&quot; behaviour of African slaves as being partially caused by slavery itself, as he believed that making someone a slave stripped them of any virtues and rendered them mentally deficient, regardless of race. Burke proposed a gradual program of emancipation called Sketch of a Negro Code, which Collins argues was quite detailed for the time. Collins concludes that Burke&#x27;s &quot;gradualist&quot; position on the emancipation of slaves, while perhaps seeming ridiculous to some modern-day readers, was nonetheless sincere.

==India and the impeachment of Warren Hastings==

For years, Burke pursued impeachment efforts against Warren Hastings, formerly Governor-General of Bengal, that resulted in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings&#x27; impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation. In 1781, Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the East India Company when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial, India was Burke&#x27;s primary concern. This committee was charged &quot;to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties&quot;. While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second secret committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the Indian princes that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the East India Company should recall Hastings. This was Burke&#x27;s first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that &quot;began &#x27;in commerce&#x27; but &#x27;ended in empire&#x27;&quot;.

On 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, &quot;The Nabob of Arcot&#x27;s Debts&quot;, wherein he condemned the damage to India by the East India Company. In the province of the Carnatic, the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:
These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind.

Burke claimed that the advent of East India Company domination in India had eroded much that was good in these traditions and that as a consequence of this and the lack of new customs to replace them the Indian populace under Company rule was needlessly suffering. He set about establishing a set of imperial expectations, whose moral foundation would in his opinion warrant an overseas empire.

On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the House of Commons with the &quot;Article of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; against Hastings. The impeachment in Westminster Hall which did not begin until 14 February 1788 would be the &quot;first major public discursive event of its kind in England&quot;, bringing the morality of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke was already known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance. Burke&#x27;s indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a &quot;captain-general of iniquity&quot; who never dined without &quot;creating a famine&quot;, whose heart was &quot;gangrened to the core&quot; and who resembled both a &quot;spider of Hell&quot; and a &quot;ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead&quot;. The House of Commons eventually impeached Hastings, but subsequently the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.

==French Revolution: 1688 versus 1789==

Initially, Burke did not condemn the French Revolution. In a letter of 9 August 1789, he wrote: &quot;England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner&quot;. The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son Richard Burke dated 10 October, he said: &quot;This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable&quot;. On 4 November, Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken &quot;as no more than the expression of doubt&quot;, but he added: &quot;You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover&#x27;d freedom&quot;. In the same month, he described France as &quot;a country undone&quot;. Burke&#x27;s first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred during the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790 provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:

Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France. The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures...[There was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy...[In religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.

In January 1790, Burke read Richard Price&#x27;s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled &quot;A Discourse on the Love of Our Country&quot; to the Revolution Society. That society had been founded to commemorate the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In this sermon, Price espoused the philosophy of universal &quot;Rights of Men&quot;. Price argued that love of our country &quot;does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government&quot;. Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves &quot;more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community&quot;.

A debate between Price and Burke ensued that was &quot;the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public&quot;. Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included &quot;the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves&quot;.

Immediately after reading Price&#x27;s sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;. On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, but he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November, he finally published the &quot;Reflections&quot; and it was an immediate best-seller. Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, but by the end of 1790, it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator Pierre-Gaëton Dupont wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.

What the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics. In the &quot;Reflections&quot;, Burke argued against Price&#x27;s interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it. Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:

The Revolution was made to preserve our &quot;antient&quot; indisputable laws and liberties, and that &quot;antient&quot; constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty...The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as &quot;an inheritance from our forefathers&quot;. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant...Our oldest reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will see that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to Blackstone, are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter...were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom...In the famous law...called the &quot;Petition of Right&quot;, the parliament says to the king, &quot;Your subjects have &quot;inherited&quot; this freedom&quot;, claiming their franchises not on abstract principles &quot;as the rights of men&quot;, but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.

Burke said: &quot;We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to Parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is &quot;natural&quot; to be so affected&quot;. Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is &quot;the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages&quot; and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. &quot;Prejudice&quot;, Burke claimed, &quot;is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, sceptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man&#x27;s virtue his habit&quot;. Burke criticised social contract theory by claiming that society is indeed a contract, although it is &quot;a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born&quot;.

The most famous passage in Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; was his description of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of Marie-Antoinette in them. Burke&#x27;s account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it provoked both praise and criticism. Philip Francis wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was &quot;pure foppery&quot;. Edward Gibbon reacted differently: &quot;I adore his chivalry&quot;. Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been &quot;led in triumph&quot; during the October Days, but to Burke, this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.

Louis XVI translated the &quot;Reflections&quot; &quot;from end to end&quot; into French. Fellow Whig MPs Richard Sheridan and Charles James Fox disagreed with Burke and split with him. Fox thought the &quot;Reflections&quot; to be &quot;in very bad taste&quot; and &quot;favouring Tory principles&quot;. Other Whigs such as the Duke of Portland and Earl Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke, but they did not wish for a public breach with their Whig colleagues. Burke wrote on 29 November 1790: &quot;I have received from the Duke of Portland, Lord Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Devonshire, Lord John Cavendish, Montagu (Frederick Montagu MP), and a long et cetera of the old Stamina of the Whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution&quot;. The Duke of Portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the &quot;Reflections&quot; to him, he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true Whig creed.

In the opinion of Paul Langford, Burke crossed something of a Rubicon when he attended a levee on 3 February 1791 to meet the King, later described by Jane Burke as follows:

On his coming to Town for the Winter, as he generally does, he went to the Levee with the Duke of &quot;Portland&quot;, who went with Lord William to kiss hands on his going into the Guards—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [Burke] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for [Burke]&#x27;s coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how long have you been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w&#x27;ont hear, and none so blind as those that w&#x27;ont see—[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of &quot;use to us all&quot;, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty&#x27;s adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]—I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.

Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; sparked a pamphlet war. Mary Wollstonecraft was one of the first into print, publishing &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; a few weeks after Burke. Thomas Paine followed with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; in 1791. James Mackintosh, who wrote &quot;Vindiciae Gallicae&quot;, was the first to see the &quot;Reflections&quot; as &quot;the manifesto of a Counter Revolution&quot;. Mackintosh later agreed with Burke&#x27;s views, remarking in December 1796 after meeting him that Burke was &quot;minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relating to the French Revolution&quot;. Mackintosh later said: &quot;Burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time. He is without parallel in any age, excepting perhaps Lord Bacon and Cicero; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever&quot;.
In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising &quot;Reflections&quot; and requesting more &quot;very refreshing mental food&quot; that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published &quot;A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly&quot;. Burke called for external forces to reverse the Revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed &quot;a considerable insight into human nature&quot;, he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–1767, Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau &quot;entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but &quot;vanity&quot;&quot;—which he &quot;was possessed to a degree little short of madness&quot;. He also cited Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; as evidence that Rousseau had a life of &quot;obscure and vulgar vices&quot; that was not &quot;chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action&quot;. Burke contrasted Rousseau&#x27;s theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital, stating that he was &quot;a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred&quot;.

These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whigs led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke&#x27;s friendship with Fox. In a debate in Parliament on Britain&#x27;s relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the Revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was &quot;overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House&quot;. When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the Revolution and criticised some of Burke&#x27;s arguments such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill and condemn the new French Constitution and &quot;the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man&quot;. Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. However, a vote of censure was moved against Burke for noticing the affairs of France which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke&#x27;s own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before. Burke&#x27;s response was as follows:
It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, &quot;Fly from the French Constitution&quot;.

At this point, Fox whispered that there was &quot;no loss of friendship&quot;. &quot;I regret to say there is&quot;, Burke replied, &quot;I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend. There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches&quot;. This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion. Fox appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but he also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered &quot;unusually bitter sarcasms&quot;. This only aggravated the rupture between the two men. Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him.

Burke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the &quot;Reflections&quot;, had rejected them in favour of &quot;French principles&quot; and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles. Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism.

Burke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox&#x27;s views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution. Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig Party &quot;as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings&quot; so that he could &quot;stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be...their sentiments&quot;. On 3 August 1791, Burke published his &quot;Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs&quot; in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig Party.

Burke owned two copies of what has been called &quot;that practical compendium of Whig political theory&quot;, namely &quot;The Tryal of Dr. Henry Sacheverell&quot; (1710). Burke wrote of the trial: &quot;It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution&quot;. Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his &quot;Appeal&quot;:
[The] foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr. Burke&#x27;s Reflections; that is to say,—a breach of the &quot;original contract&quot;, implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons.—That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution. That it was justified &quot;only&quot; upon the &quot;necessity&quot; of the case; as the &quot;only&quot; means left for the recovery of that &quot;antient&quot; constitution, formed by the &quot;original contract&quot; of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the &quot;same&quot; government. These are the points to be proved.

Burke then provided quotations from Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed. Burke&#x27;s belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine&#x27;s was genuine. Finally, Burke denied that a majority of &quot;the people&quot; had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure. People had rights, but also duties and these duties were not voluntary. According to Burke, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God.

Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot;, they wished he had used more moderate language. Fitzwilliam saw the &quot;Appeal&quot; as containing &quot;the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since&quot;. Francis Basset, a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke that &quot;though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox &amp; from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution&quot;. Burke sent a copy of the &quot;Appeal&quot; to the King and the King requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it &quot;with great Satisfaction&quot;. Burke wrote of its reception: &quot;Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox...They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice&quot;. Charles Burney viewed it as &quot;a most admirable book—the best &amp; most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen&quot;, but he believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.

Eventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s Tory government which in response to France&#x27;s declaration of war against Britain declared war on France&#x27;s Revolutionary Government in 1793.

In December 1791, Burke sent government ministers his &quot;Thoughts on French Affairs&quot; where he put forward three main points, namely that no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; that the longer the Revolutionary Government exists, the stronger it becomes; and that the Revolutionary Government&#x27;s interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe.

As a Whig, Burke did not wish to see an absolute monarchy again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism. Writing to an &quot;émigré&quot; in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;:

When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men&#x27;s minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call &#x27;L&#x27;ancien Régime,&#x27; If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho&#x27; not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L&#x27;Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.

Burke delivered a speech on the debate of the Aliens Bill on 28 December 1792. He supported the Bill as it would exclude &quot;murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness&quot;. The peroration included a reference to a French order for 3,000 daggers. Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: &quot;This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France&quot;. Burke picked up the dagger and continued:

When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is—blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—&#x27;Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto&#x27; [&#x27;Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman&#x27;. Horace, &quot;Satires&quot; I. 4. 85.].

Burke supported the war against Revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting on the side of the royalists and &quot;émigres&quot; in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France. Burke also supported the royalist uprising in La Vendée, describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to William Windham as &quot;the sole affair I have much heart in&quot;. Burke wrote to Henry Dundas on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris, but Dundas did not follow Burke&#x27;s advice.

Burke believed the British government was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the Prince Charles of France (&quot;S.A.R. le comte d&#x27;Artois&quot;), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the government. Burke was forced to reply on 6 November: &quot;I am not in His Majesty&#x27;s Service; or at all consulted in his Affairs&quot;. Burke published his &quot;Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France&quot;, begun in October, where he said: &quot;I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vendée is a proof of this&quot;.

On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the House of Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached and in whom he saw signs of promise which were not patent to others and which in fact appear to have been non-existent, although this view may have rather reflected the fact that his son Richard had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation. King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his &quot;Letter to a Noble Lord&quot; (1796): &quot;It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, &quot;To innovate is not to reform&quot;&quot;. He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: &quot;Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth&quot;. Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented and included a description of the English Constitution:
But as to &quot;our&quot; country and &quot;our&quot; race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.

Burke&#x27;s last publications were the &quot;Letters on a Regicide Peace&quot; (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as appeasement, injurious to national dignity and honour. In his &quot;Second Letter&quot;, Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary government: &quot;Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms&quot;.

This is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of totalitarian state. Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an &quot;armed doctrine&quot;. He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her. Burke said: &quot;It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France&quot;.

==Later life==
In November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject. In December, Samuel Whitbread MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it. This debate probably led Burke to edit his memorandum as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture Arthur Young, but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as &quot;Thoughts and Details on Scarcity&quot;. In it, Burke expounded &quot;some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade&quot;. Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages and set out what the limits of government should be:
That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is &quot;truly and properly&quot; public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.

The economist Adam Smith remarked that Burke was &quot;the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us&quot;.

Writing to a friend in May 1795, Burke surveyed the causes of discontent: &quot;I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism [i.e. corporate tyranny, as practised by the British East Indies Company], as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil&quot;. By March 1796, Burke had changed his mind: &quot;Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all &quot;formal&quot; Government&quot;.

For more than a year prior to his death, Burke knew that his stomach was &quot;irrecoverably ruind&quot;. After hearing that Burke was nearing death, Fox wrote to Mrs. Burke enquiring after him. Fox received the reply the next day:
Mrs. Burke presents her compliments to Mr. Fox, and thanks him for his obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke is convinced that the principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.

Burke died in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, on 9 July 1797 and was buried there alongside his son and brother.

==Legacy==


Burke is regarded by most political historians in the English-speaking world as a liberal conservative and the father of modern British conservatism. Burke was utilitarian and empirical in his arguments while Joseph de Maistre, a fellow European conservative, was more providentialist and sociological and deployed a more confrontational tone in his arguments.

Burke believed that property was essential to human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke&#x27;s only influence. Christopher Hitchens summarises as follows: &quot;If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial&quot;.

Burke&#x27;s support for the causes of the &quot;oppressed majorities&quot;, such as Irish Catholics and Indians, led him to be at the receiving end of hostile criticism from Tories; while his opposition to the spread of the French Republic (and its radical ideals) across Europe led to similar charges from Whigs. As a consequence, Burke often became isolated in Parliament.

In the 19th century, Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke&#x27;s friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke &quot;was a man who truly &amp; prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles&quot;, but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments. William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had when he had separated from Fox and an observer said Windham spoke &quot;like the ghost of Burke&quot; when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801. William Hazlitt, a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau) and made it &quot;a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man&quot;. William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in &quot;A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff&quot; (1793), but by the early 19th century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his &quot;Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland&quot;, Wordsworth called Burke &quot;the most sagacious Politician of his age&quot;, whose predictions &quot;time has verified&quot;. He later revised his poem &quot;The Prelude&quot; to include praise of Burke (&quot;Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders&quot;) and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion as he had criticised Burke in &quot;The Watchman&quot;, but in his &quot;Friend&quot; (1809–1810) had defended Burke from charges of inconsistency. Later in his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot; (1817), Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring &quot;habitually to &quot;principles&quot;. He was a &quot;scientific&quot; statesman; and therefore a &quot;seer&quot;&quot;. Henry Brougham wrote of Burke that &quot;all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe...[T]he providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity&quot;. George Canning believed that Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; &quot;has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled&quot;. In 1823, Canning wrote that he took Burke&#x27;s &quot;last works and words [as] the manual of my politics&quot;. The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli &quot;was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke&#x27;s later writings&quot;.

The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone considered Burke &quot;a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America&quot; and in his diary recorded: &quot;Made many extracts from Burke—&quot;sometimes almost divine&quot;&quot;. The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts and Details on Scarcity&quot;. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: &quot;I have now finished reading again most of Burke&#x27;s works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton&quot;. The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved &quot;a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics, he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site&quot;. Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best-known and most influential work and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.

Two contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by Karl Marx and Winston Churchill. In a footnote to Volume One of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Marx wrote:

The sycophant—who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic &quot;laudator temporis acti&quot; against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy—was an out-and-out vulgar bourgeois. &quot;The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God.&quot; (E. Burke, l.c., pp. 31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market.

In &quot;Consistency in Politics&quot;, Churchill wrote:

On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.

The historian Piers Brendon asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the British Empire, epitomised in the trial of Warren Hastings, that was ultimately to be its undoing. When Burke stated that &quot;[t]he British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other&quot;, this was &quot;an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal. This was Edmund Burke&#x27;s paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust. It was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright—freedom&quot;. As a consequence of these opinions, Burke objected to the opium trade which he called a &quot;smuggling adventure&quot; and condemned &quot;the great Disgrace of the British character in India&quot;. According to political scientist Jennifer Pitts, Burke &quot;was arguably the first political thinker to undertake a comprehensive critique of British imperial practice in the name of justice for those who suffered from its moral and political exclusions.&quot;

A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque commemorates Burke at 37 Gerrard Street now in London&#x27;s Chinatown.

Statues of Burke are in Bristol, England, Trinity College Dublin and Washington, D.C. Burke is also the namesake of a private college preparatory school in Washington, Edmund Burke School.

Burke Avenue, in The Bronx, New York, is named for him.

==Criticism==
One of Burke&#x27;s largest and most developed critics was the American political theorist Leo Strauss. In his book &quot;Natural Right and History&quot;, Strauss makes a series of points in which he somewhat harshly evaluates Burke&#x27;s writings.

One of the topics that he first addresses is the fact that Burke creates a definitive separation between happiness and virtue and explains that &quot;Burke, therefore, seeks the foundation of government &#x27;in a conformity to our duties&#x27; and not in &#x27;imaginary rights of man&quot;. Strauss views Burke as believing that government should focus solely on the duties that a man should have in society as opposed to trying to address any additional needs or desires. Government is simply a practicality to Burke and not necessarily meant to function as a tool to help individuals live as well as possible. Strauss also argues that in a sense Burke&#x27;s theory could be seen as opposing the very idea of forming such philosophies. Burke expresses the view that theory cannot adequately predict future occurrences and therefore men need to have instincts that cannot be practised or derived from ideology.

This leads to an overarching criticism that Strauss holds regarding Burke which is his rejection of the use of logic. Burke dismisses a widely held view amongst theorists that reason should be the primary tool in the forming of a constitution or contract. Burke instead believes that constitutions should be made based on natural processes as opposed to rational planning for the future. However, Strauss points out that criticising rationality actually works against Burke&#x27;s original stance of returning to traditional ways because some amount of human reason is inherent and therefore is in part grounded in tradition. In regards to this formation of legitimate social order, Strauss does not necessarily support Burke&#x27;s opinion—that order cannot be established by individual wise people, but exclusively by a culmination of individuals with historical knowledge of past functions to use as a foundation. Strauss notes that Burke would oppose more newly formed republics due to this thought, although Lenzner adds the fact that he did seem to believe that America&#x27;s constitution could be justified given the specific circumstances. On the other hand, France&#x27;s constitution was much too radical as it relied too heavily on enlightened reasoning as opposed to traditional methods and values.

==Religious thought==

Burke&#x27;s religious writing comprises published works and commentary on the subject of religion. Burke&#x27;s religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society. He sharply criticised deism and atheism and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress. Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Church of England, but he also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns. He linked the conservation of a state-established religion with the preservation of citizens&#x27; constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity&#x27;s benefit not only to the believer&#x27;s soul, but also to political arrangements.

==Misattributed quotation==
===&quot;When good men do nothing&quot;===
The well-known maxim that &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing&quot; is widely misattributed to Burke. It is known that, in 1770, Burke wrote the following passage in &quot;Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents&quot;:
In 1867, John Stuart Mill made a similar statement in an inaugural address delivered at the University of St Andrews:

<text>Early music generally comprises Medieval music (500–1400) and Renaissance music (1400–1600), but can also include Baroque music (1600–1750). Originating in Europe, early music is a broad musical era for the beginning of Western classical music.

==Terminology==
Interpretations of historical scope of &quot;early music&quot; vary. The original Academy of Ancient Music formed in 1726 defined &quot;Ancient&quot; music as works written by composers who lived before the end of the 16th century. Johannes Brahms and his contemporaries would have understood Early music to range from the High Renaissance and Baroque, while some scholars consider that Early music should include the music of ancient Greece or Rome before 500 AD (a period that is generally covered by the term Ancient music). Music critic Michael Kennedy excludes Baroque, defining Early music as &quot;musical compositions from [the] earliest times up to and including music of [the] Renaissance period&quot;.

Musicologist Thomas Forrest Kelly considers that the essence of Early music is the revival of &quot;forgotten&quot; musical repertoire and that the term is intertwined with the rediscovery of old performance practice. According to the UK&#x27;s National Centre for Early Music, the term &quot;early music&quot; refers to both a repertory (European music written between 1250 and 1750 embracing Medieval, Renaissance and the Baroque) – and a historically informed approach to the performance of that music.

Today, the understanding of &quot;Early music&quot; has come to include &quot;any music for which a historically appropriate style of performance must be reconstructed on the basis of surviving scores, treatises, instruments and other contemporary evidence.&quot;

==Revival==

In the later 20th century there was a resurgence of interest in the performance of music from the Medieval and Renaissance eras, and a number of instrumental consorts and choral ensembles specialising in Early music repertoire were formed. Groups such as the Tallis Scholars, the Early Music Consort and the Taverner Consort and Players have been influential in bringing Early music to modern audiences through performances and popular recordings.

==Performance practice==

The revival of interest in Early music has given rise to a scholarly approach to the performance of music. Through academic musicological research of music treatises, urtext editions of musical scores and other historical evidence, performers attempt to be faithful to the performance style of the musical era in which a work was originally conceived. Additionally, there has been a rise in the use of original or reproduction period instruments as part of the performance of Early music, such as the revival of the harpsichord or the viol.

The practice of &quot;historically informed performance&quot; is nevertheless dependent on stylistic inference. According to Margaret Bent, Renaissance notation is not as prescriptive as modern scoring, and there is much that was left to the performer&#x27;s interpretation: &quot;Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive by our standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness. Accidentals … may or may not have been notated, but what modern notation requires would then have been perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint&quot;.

<text>Elfenland is a German-style board game designed by Alan R. Moon and published by Amigo Spiele in German and Rio Grande Games in English in 1998. &quot;Elfenland&quot; won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1998. 

== Background ==
The game was originally based on his earlier game &quot;Elfenroads&quot; (published by White Wind), but since &quot;Elfenroads&quot; took about four hours for a game, the play was simplified to reduce the time closer to an hour, making it appeal more as a family game.

== Gameplay ==
The game is played by 2–6 players, with 4–5 making for the best game. 
Each player tries to reach as many cities as possible and then return to his &quot;home city.&quot; 
Home cities are drawn at the beginning of the game from a pack of city cards and they remain hidden throughout the game.
The game is thus reminiscent of the traveling salesman problem.

Players move using transportation cards. 
Elves can travel on a wide variety of vehicles including troll wagons, elf cycles, rafts, giant pigs, unicorns, dragons and magic clouds. 
Different types of transportation will travel better over different terrain, and some methods of transport cannot cross certain terrains at all. 
There is only one problem: you cannot travel over a route (except water) unless there is a tile on that road, and only the type of transport shown on the tile can be used to move along that road. Before anyone can move, tiles are drawn and laid out across the board. This part is the one that calls for the most strategy, as players try to line up their tiles to set up a nice route for themselves and a difficult one for their opponents at the same time.

As well as normal tiles, each player receives one trouble tile for use during the game.
These hinder other players by forcing them to use an extra transportation card at that point. 
Also, any player can simply use any three cards to pass over any route that has a tile already there, allowing the type of transport shown on the tile to be ignored.

The game has subtle strategies to make others navigate through the cities. 
When a player puts a transportation type you don&#x27;t want in your path then you have to find a way around it. 
All of the aspects of the game make for a very exciting race to visit the most cities while never quite being sure who is winning until the last round.

==Expansion==
There was an expansion for &quot;Elfenland&quot; published, called &quot;Elfengold&quot;.
Note that this is different from the original &quot;Elfengold&quot; published by White Wind.

== Reception ==
Bernhard Fischer from &quot;Spieltest&quot; praised the game&#x27;s mechanisms, and accessibility, but was mixed on the luck elements. It also won the 1998 Spiel des Jahres award, and placed third place in the 1998 Deutscher Spiele Preis award.

<doc id="10037" wikidata="Q223200" url="?curid=10037" title="Euroscepticism">
<text>Euroscepticism, also spelled as Euroskepticism or EU-scepticism, is a political position involving criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. It ranges from those who oppose some EU institutions and policies and seek reform (&quot;Eurorealism&quot;, &quot;Eurocritical&quot;, or &quot;soft Euroscepticism&quot;), to those who oppose EU membership and see the EU as unreformable (&quot;anti-European Unionism&quot;, &quot;anti-EUism&quot;, or &quot;hard Euroscepticism&quot;). The opposite of Euroscepticism is known as &quot;pro-Europeanism&quot;.

The main drivers of Euroscepticism have been beliefs that integration undermines national sovereignty and the nation state, that the EU is elitist and lacks democratic legitimacy and transparency, that it is too bureaucratic and wasteful, that it encourages high levels of immigration, or perceptions that it is a neoliberal organisation serving the big business elite at the expense of the working class, that it is responsible for austerity, and drives privatization.

Euroscepticism is found in groups across the political spectrum, both left-wing and right-wing, and is often found in populist parties. Although they criticise the EU for many of the same reasons, Eurosceptic left-wing populists focus more on economic issues, such as the European debt crisis and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, while Eurosceptic right-wing populists focus more on nationalism and immigration, such as the 2015 European migrant crisis. The rise in radical-right parties since the 2000s is strongly linked to a rise in Euroscepticism.

Eurobarometer surveys of EU citizens show that trust in the EU and its institutions declined strongly from 2007 to 2015. In that period, it was consistently below 50%. A 2009 survey showed that support for EU membership was lowest in the United Kingdom (UK), Latvia, and Hungary. By 2016, the countries viewing the EU most unfavourably were the UK, Greece, France, and Spain. The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum resulted in a 51.9% vote in favour of leaving the EU (Brexit), a decision that came into effect on 31 January 2020.

Since 2015, trust in the EU has risen in most EU countries as a result of falling unemployment rates and the end of the migrant crisis. A post-2019 election Eurobarometer survey showed that 68% of citizens support the EU, the highest level since 1983; however, sentiment that things are not going in the right direction in the EU had increased to 50%. Trust in the EU had increased significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic with levels varying across member states.

==Reasoning==
The main reasons for Euroscepticism include beliefs that:
* integration undermines national sovereignty and the nation state;
* the EU is elitist and lacks democratic legitimacy and transparency;
* the EU is too bureaucratic and wasteful;
* it encourages high levels of immigration;
* it is a neoliberal organisation serving the big business elite at the expense of the working class
* the EU is responsible for austerity;
* the EU is responsible for driving privatization.

==Terminology==
There can be considered to be several different types of Eurosceptic thought, which differ in the extent to which adherents reject integration between member states of the EU and in their reasons for doing so. Aleks Szczerbiak and Paul Taggart described two of these as hard and soft Euroscepticism. At the same time, some scholars have said that there is no clear line between the presumed hard and soft Euroscepticism. Cas Mudde and Petr Kopecky have said that if the demarcation line is the number of and which policies a party opposes, then the question arises of how many must a party oppose and which ones should a party oppose that makes them hard Eurosceptic instead of soft.

===Hard Euroscepticism===
According to Taggart and Szczerbiak, hard Euroscepticism, or anti-EU-ism, is &quot;a principled opposition to the EU and European integration and therefore can be seen in parties who think that their countries should withdraw from membership, or whose policies towards the EU are tantamount to being opposed to the whole project of European integration as it is currently conceived&quot;. The Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament (2014–2019) displayed hard Euroscepticism, but following the 2019 EU elections the group was disbanded due to too few members, as its largest member, the British Brexit Party, withdrew ahead of the United Kingdom&#x27;s formal exit from the EU.

Some hard Eurosceptics regard their position as pragmatic rather than in principle. Additionally, Tony Benn, a left-wing Labour Party MP who fought against European integration in 1975 by opposing membership of the European Communities in that year&#x27;s referendum on the issue, emphasised his opposition to xenophobia and his support of democracy, saying: &quot;My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy. ... I think they&#x27;re building an empire there, they want us to be a part of their empire and I don&#x27;t want that.&quot;

The Czech president Václav Klaus rejected the term &quot;Euroscepticism&quot; for its purported negative undertones, saying at a meeting in April 2012 that the expressions for a Eurosceptic and their opponent should be &quot;a Euro-realist&quot; and someone who is &quot;Euro-naïve&quot;, respectively. François Asselineau of the French Popular Republican Union has criticised the use of the term &#x27;sceptic&#x27; to describe hard Eurosceptics, and would rather advocate the use of the term &quot;Euro opponent&quot;. He believes the use of the term &#x27;sceptic&#x27; for soft Eurosceptics to be correct, since other Eurosceptic parties in France are &quot;merely criticising&quot; the EU without taking into account the fact that the Treaty of Rome can only be modified with a unanimous agreement of all the EU member states, something he considers impossible to achieve.

===Soft Euroscepticism===
Soft Euroscepticism, also known as Eurorealism, reflects a support for the existence of, and membership of, a form of EU but with opposition to specific EU policies, or in Taggart&#x27;s and Szczerbiak&#x27;s words, &quot;where there is NOT a principled objection to European integration or EU membership but where concerns on one (or a number) of policy areas lead to the expression of qualified opposition to the EU, or where there is a sense that &#x27;national interest&#x27; is currently at odds with the EU&#x27;s trajectory.&quot;

Both the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, dominated by the right-wing Polish party Law and Justice, and the European United Left–Nordic Green Left, which is an alliance of the left-wing parties in the European Parliament, display soft Euroscepticism. The European Conservatives and Reformist Group does not itself use the descriptions Euroscepticism or soft Euroscepticism and instead describes its position as one of Eurorealism, a distinction described by Leruth as being one that is &quot;quite subtle but should not be ignored&quot; given the association of the term Euroscepticism with &quot;European disintegration&quot;. Leruth describes Eurorealism as &quot;a pragmatic, anti-federalist, and flexible vision of European integration where the principle of subsidiarity prevails, aiming to reform the current institutional framework to extend the role of national parliaments in the decision-making process.&quot; Steven states that &quot;Eurorealism is a form of conservativism, first and foremost, rather than a form or Euroscepticism, even if it obviously very much also has the &#x27;soft&#x27; Eurosceptic tendencies which are present in a number of ECR member parties.&quot;

===Anti-Europeanism===

While having some overlaps, Euroscepticism and anti-Europeanism are different. Euroscepticism is criticism of the European Union (EU) and European integration. Anti-Europeanism is sentiment or policies in opposition to Europe. For example, American exceptionalism in the United States has long led to criticism of European domestic policy, such as the size of the welfare state in European countries, and foreign policy, such as European countries that did not support the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Other terms===

Some scholars consider the gradual difference in terminology between hard and soft Euroscepticism inadequate to accommodate the large differences in terms of political agenda; &quot;hard Euroscepticism&quot; has also been referred to as &quot;Europhobia&quot; as opposed to mere &quot;Euroscepticism&quot;. Other alternative names for hard and soft Euroscepticism include &quot;withdrawalist&quot; and &quot;reformist&quot;, respectively.

==Eurobarometer surveys==

A survey in , conducted by TNS Opinion and Social on behalf of the European Commission, showed that, across the EU as a whole, those with a positive image of the EU were down from a high of 52% in 2007 to 37% in autumn 2015; this compares with 23% with a negative image of the EU, and 38% with a neutral image. About 43% of Europeans thought things were &quot;going in the wrong direction&quot; in the EU, compared with 23% who thought things were going &quot;in the right direction&quot; (11% &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;). About 32% of EU citizens tend to trust the EU as an institution, and about 55% do not tend to trust it (13% &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;). Distrust of the EU was highest in Greece (81%), Cyprus (72%), Austria (65%), France (65%), the United Kingdom (UK) and the Czech Republic (both 63%). Overall, more respondents distrusted their own government (66%) than they distrusted the EU (55%). Distrust of national government was highest in Greece (82%), Slovenia (80%), Portugal (79%), Cyprus (76%), and France (76%).

A Eurobarometer survey carried out four days prior to and six days after the 2016 United States presidential election revealed that the surprise victory of Donald Trump caused an increase in the popularity of the EU in Europe. The increase was strongest among the political right and among respondents who perceived their country as economically struggling.

A survey carried out in April 2018 for the European Parliament by Kantar Public consulting found that support for the EU was &quot;the highest score ever measured since 1983&quot;. Support for the EU was up in 26 out of 28 EU countries, the exceptions being Germany and the UK, where support had dropped by about 2% since the previous survey. Almost half (48%) of the 27,601 EU citizens surveyed agreed that their voice counted in the EU, up from 37% in 2016, whereas 46% disagreed with this statement. Two-thirds (67%) of respondents felt that their country had benefited from EU membership and 60% said that being part of the bloc was a good thing, as opposed to 12% who felt the opposite. At the height of the EU&#x27;s financial and economic crises in 2011, just 47% had been of the view that EU membership was a good thing. Support for EU membership was greatest in Malta (93%), Ireland (91%), Lithuania (90%), Poland (88%), Luxembourg (88%), Estonia (86%), and Denmark (84%), and lowest in Greece (57%), Bulgaria (57%), Cyprus (56%), Austria (54%), the United Kingdom (53%), and Italy (44%).

When asked which issues should be a priority for the European Parliament, survey respondents picked terrorism as the most pressing topic of discussion, ahead of youth unemployment and immigration. Not all countries shared the same priorities. Immigration topped the list in Italy (66% of citizens surveyed considered it a priority issue), Malta (65%), and Hungary (62%) but fighting youth unemployment and support for economic growth were top concerns in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Cyprus, and Croatia. Social protection of citizens was the top concern for Dutch, Swedish, and Danish respondents.

The April 2019 Eurobarometer showed that despite the challenges of the past years, and in cases such as the ongoing debate surrounding Brexit, possibly even because of it, the European sense of togetherness had not weakened, with 68% of respondents across the EU27 believing that their countries have benefited from being part of the EU, a historically high level since 1983. On the other hand, more Europeans (27%) were uncertain and saw the EU as &quot;neither a good thing nor a bad thing&quot;, an increase in 19 countries. Despite the overall positive attitude towards the EU but in line with the uncertainty expressed by a growing number of Europeans, the feeling that things were not going in the right direction in both the EU and in their own countries had increased to 50% on EU average since September 2018.

The Eurobarometer 93.1 survey was in the field across Europe when the European Council summit reached political agreement on a pandemic economic recovery fund (later named Next Generation EU) on 21 July 2020. A comparison of Eurobarometer responses gathered before this seminal decision and interviews conducted shortly thereafter indicates that the European Council&#x27;s endorsement of pandemic economic relief increased popular support of COVID-19 economic recovery aid - but only among Europeans who view EU decisionmakers as trustworthy.


==History in the European Parliament==

===1999–2004===
A study analysed voting records of the Fifth European Parliament and ranked groups, concluding: &quot;Towards the top of the figure are the more pro-European parties (PES, EPP-ED, and ALDE), whereas towards the bottom of the figure are the more anti-European parties (EUL/NGL, G/EFA, UEN and EDD).&quot;

===2004–2009===
In 2004, 37 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the UK, Poland, Denmark and Sweden founded a new European Parliament group called &quot;Independence and Democracy&quot; from the old Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) group.

The main goal of the ID group was to reject the proposed Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. Some delegations within the group, notably that from UKIP, also advocated the complete withdrawal of their country from the EU, while others only wished to limit further European integration.

===2009 elections===
The elections of 2009 saw a significant fall in support in some areas for Eurosceptic parties, with all such MEPs from Poland, Denmark and Sweden losing their seats. In the UK, the Eurosceptic UKIP achieved second place in the election, finishing ahead of the governing Labour Party, and the British National Party (BNP) won its first-ever two MEPs. Although new members joined the ID group from Greece and the Netherlands, it was unclear whether the group would reform in the new parliament.

The ID group did reform, as the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) and is represented by 32 MEPs from nine countries.

===2014 elections===
The elections of 2014 saw a big anti-establishment vote in favour of Eurosceptic parties, which took around a quarter of the seats available. Those that came first their national elections included: UKIP in the UK (the first time since 1906 that a party other than Labour or the Conservatives had won a national vote), the National Front in France, the People&#x27;s Party in Denmark and Syriza in Greece. Second places were taken by Sinn Féin in Ireland and the Five Star Movement in Italy. Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, agreed following the election to re-evaluate the economic area&#x27;s agenda and to launch consultations on future policy areas with the 28 member states.

===2019 elections===
The elections of 2019 saw the centre-left and centre-right parties suffer significant losses including losing their overall majority, while green, pro-EU liberal, and some Eurosceptic right wing parties saw significant gains. Those that came first in their national elections included: the Brexit Party in the UK (which was only launched on 12 April 2019 by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage), the National Rally of France (formerly the National Front party until June 2018), Fidesz in Hungary, Lega in Italy, and Law and Justice in Poland. There were also notable falls in support for the Danish People&#x27;s Party (previously topped the 2014 European election). Whilst Vox got elected with 3 seats, Spain&#x27;s first Eurosceptic party and Belgium&#x27;s Vlaams Belang rallied to gain second place after its poor 2014 result.

===2024 elections===
In the elections of 2024, 24 EU countries elected at least one member of a Eurosceptic group (European Conservatives and Reformists Group, Patriots for Europe or Europe of Sovereign Nations). The three exceptions were Ireland, Malta and Slovenia.

==In EU member states==
===Austria===
The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), established in 1956, is a right-wing populist party that mainly attracts support from young people and workers. In 1989, it changed its stance over the EU to Euroscepticism. It opposed Austria joining the EU in 1994, and opposed the introduction of the euro in 1998. The party would like to leave the EU if it threatens to develop into a country, or if Turkey joins. The FPÖ received 20–27% of the national vote in the 1990s, and more recently received 18% in 2008. Following the 2017 Austrian legislative election, it has 51/183 National Council seats, 16/62 Federal Council seats, and 4/19 European Parliament seats.

The Bündnis Zukunft Österreich (BZÖ), established in 2005, is a socially conservative party that has always held Eurosceptic elements. In 2011 the party openly supported leaving the eurozone, and in 2012 it announced that it supported a full withdrawal from the European Union. The party has also called upon a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. In polls it generally received around 10–15%, although in one state it did receive 45% of the vote in 2009. Since the 2017 election, it has 0/183 National Council seats, 0/62 Federal Council seats, and 0/19 European Parliament seats.

Team Stronach, established in 2012, has campaigned to reform the European Union, as well as to replace the euro with an Austrian Euro. In 2012, it regularly received 8–10% support in national polls. Politicians from many different parties (including the Social Democratic Party and the BZÖ) as well as previous independents switched their allegiances to the new party upon creation. In two local elections in March 2013, it won 11% of the vote in Carinthia, and 10% of the vote in Lower Austria. It dissolved in 2017.

Ewald Stadler, a former member of FPÖ (and later of BZÖ) was very Eurosceptic, but in 2011 became a member of the European Parliament due to the Lisbon Treaty. Before Stadler accepted the seat, this led to heavy critics by Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ) &quot;Stadler wants to just rescue his political career&quot; because Stadler before mentioned he would never accept a seat as MEP if this was only due to the Lisbon Treaty. On 23 December 2013 he founded a conservative and Eurosceptic party called The Reform Conservatives, although it has been inactive since June 2016.

In the 2014 European Parliament election, the FPÖ increased its vote to 19.7% (up 7.0%), gaining 2 new MEPs, making a total of 4; the party came third, behind the ÖVP and the SPÖ. EU-STOP (the electoral alliance of the EU Withdrawal Party and the Neutral Free Austria Federation) polled 2.8%, gaining no seats, and the Reform Conservatives 1.2%, with Team Stronach putting up no candidates.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the FPÖ came 3rd with 17.2% of the vote which was only slightly down on 2014 despite a scandal allegedly promising public contracts to a woman posing as a Russian backer. This precipitated the collapse of the ruling coalition and a new election being called.

===Belgium===
According to Eurostat, in the fall of 2018, 44% of Belgians stated that they did not trust the European Union. The main Eurosceptic party in Belgium is the right-wing Vlaams Belang which is active in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, however the left-wing PTB-PVDA also opposes the EU on many issues, primarily austerity and social policy. In the 2014 European Parliament election, Vlaams Belang lost over half of its previous vote share, polling 4.3% (down 5.5%) and losing 1 of its 2 members of the European Parliament. Despite the presence of Eurosceptic parties in Belgium, their weight is relatively low, as Belgium is predominantly Europeanist.

In 2019, Vlaams Belang stated in its program for the 2019 European Parliament election that it opposes the creation of a European state, would like to change the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU, and to end the Schengen Area, and refuses the accession of Turkey to the EU. More widely, the euro-sceptic arguments of the Vlaams Belang are based on four pillars:
# loss of sovereignty (for instance on economic sovereignty or on the binding legal order);
# the financial cost of the European Union;
# less competences for European Union;
# leaving the euro (even though in 2019 the party has changed its line and now wants to reform the euro). During the 2019 European Parliament election in Belgium, Vlaams Belang made substantial gains in both and polled in second place in Flemish region. At the beginning of 2019, the party was enrolled in the group of European Alliance of People and Nations in the European Parliament.

The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) is a soft Eurosceptic party in the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. Before 2010, the N-VA was pro-European and supported the idea of a democratic European confederation, but has since altered this policy to a more sceptical stance on further European integration and now calls for more democratic transparency within the EU, changes to the EU&#x27;s common asylum policy and economic reforms to the Eurozone. The N-VA has obtained 26.8% of the votes or 4 seats of the Dutch-language college out of 12 (21 MEPs for Belgium) in the 2014 European Parliament election. In April 2019, it stood in European Conservatives and Reformists Group of the European Parliament, and can be considered a moderate Eurosceptic party.

In the French-speaking part of Belgium (Walloons), there are four Eurosceptic parties. The first one is Nation Movement, a far-right party which was a member of the Alliance for Peace and Freedom in the European Parliament. The second one is National Front, also a far right party which criticizes the European bureaucracy, intends to guarantee and preserve national independence and freedom in a liberated Europe; it also reaffirms the Christian roots of Europe. The third one is the People&#x27;s Party, classified as right or extreme right. In its program for the European election of 2019 the People&#x27;s Party proposes to abolish the European Commission, reduce the number of European parliamentarians and fight against the worker-posted directive. For this party, the EU must be led by a president elected by universal suffrage with clear but limited competences. It also wants to renegotiate the European Union treaties, restrict the judicial activism of the European Court of Human Rights. It declares itself against the Global Compact for Migration. The last one is the . In early 2019, the party aims to reduce the powers of the European Commission, to abolish the Common Agricultural Policy, to abandon common defense projects, to simplify the exit procedure of the European Union, to reject federalism and to forbid the European Union to direct economic, fiscal or social policy, Finally, the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium is an electoral and unitary party. It also intends to revise the European treaties considered too liberal. One of the Party&#x27;s currencies is &quot;The left that stings, against the Europe of money&quot;.

===Bulgaria===

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are NFSB, Attack, and VMRO – BND, which is a member of the Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists Group.
Bulgaria&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Simeon Djankov, stated in 2011 that ERM II membership to enter the Euro zone would be postponed until after the Eurozone crisis had stabilised.

In the 2014 European Parliament election Bulgaria remained overwhelmingly pro-EU, with the Eurosceptic Attack party receiving 3% of the vote, down 9%, with the splinter group National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria taking 3; neither party secured any MEPs. A coalition between VMRO – BND and Bulgaria Without Censorship secured an MEP position for Angel Dzhambazki from IMRO, who is a hard Eurosceptic.

Followers of Eurosceptic Attack tore down and trampled the European flag on 3 March 2016 at a meeting of the party in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, dedicated to the commemoration of the 138th anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, Bulgaria remained overwhelmingly pro-EU with the ruling centre-right Gerb party winning with 31%, against 26% for the socialist BSP.

Since the 2021–2023 Bulgarian political crisis, the far-right hard Eurosceptic party Revival has outplaced Attack, with it getting 14% on the most recent 2023 Bulgarian parliamentary election.

===Croatia===
Parties with Eurosceptic views are mainly small right-wing parties like Croatian Party of Rights, Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević, Croatian Pure Party of Rights, Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights, Croatian Christian Democratic Party and Only Croatia – Movement for Croatia.

The only parliamentary party that is vocally Eurosceptic is the The Key of Croatia (formerly known as Human Shield) that won 5 out of 151 seats at the 2016 parliamentary election. Their position is generally considered to waver between hard and soft Euroscepticism; it requests thorough reform of the EU so that all member states would be perfectly equal. 

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Key of Croatia gained its first seat in the European Parliament with 6% of the vote putting it in 5th place.

The Key of Croatia would go on to lose all of its seats in the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election, and merge into the Law and Justice party in 2024. Law and Justice won a single seat (now vacant) in the 2024 parliamentary elections as part of a coalition with the Homeland Movement. Its only remaining MEPs would lose re-election in the 2024 European Parliament election.

===Cyprus===
Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views in Cyprus are the Progressive Party of Working People and ELAM.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, there was little change politically – the conservatives won narrowly, the ruling DISY taking two seats with 29%, followed by socialist AKEL (27.5%, two seats) with no seats taken by Eurosceptic parties.

===Czechia===


In May 2010, the Czech president Václav Klaus said that they &quot;needn&#x27;t hurry to enter the Eurozone&quot;.

Petr Mach, an economist, a close associate of president Václav Klaus and a member of the Civic Democratic Party between 1997 and 2007, founded the Free Citizens Party in 2009. The party aims to mainly attract dissatisfied Civic Democratic Party voters. At the time of the Lisbon Treaty ratification, they were actively campaigning against it, supported by the president Vaclav Klaus, who demanded opt-outs such as were granted to the United Kingdom and Poland, unlike the governing Civic Democratic Party, who endorsed it in the Chamber of Deputies. After the treaty has been ratified, Mach&#x27;s party is in favour of withdrawing from the European Union completely. In the 2014 European Parliament election, the Free Citizens Party won one mandate and allied with UKIP in the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFD).

The 2017 Czech legislative election brought into Parliament one soft eurosceptic party, the centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) (11%), and two hard eurosceptic parties, the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) (11%) and the left-wing to far-left Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM) (8%).

An April 2016 survey by the CVVM Institute indicated that 25% of Czechs were satisfied with EU membership, down from 32% the previous year.

Dividends worth CZK 270 billion were paid to the foreign owners of Czech companies in 2017, which has become a political issue in the Czech Republic.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Civic Democratic Party saw its vote share rise to 15% and its seats doubled from 2 to 4. The Freedom and Direct Democracy party took 2 seats with 9% of the vote. KSČM dropped 2 seats leaving it with only one and a vote share of 7%

===Denmark===


The People&#x27;s Movement against the EU only takes part in European Parliament elections and has one member in the European Parliament. The soft Eurosceptic June Movement, originally a split-off from the People&#x27;s Movement against the EU, existed from 1992 to 2009.

In the Danish Parliament, the Red-Green Alliance previously advocated withdrawal from the EU, but in March 2019, the party announced it would no longer campaign for a referendum to leave the EU, pointing to Brexit illustrating the need for clarity before withdrawal can be considered. The Danish People&#x27;s Party also advocates withdrawal, but says it supports some EU structures such as the internal market, and supported the EU-positive Liberal-Conservative coalition between 2001 and 2011 and again from 2015 to 2019.

The Socialist People&#x27;s Party, minorities within the Social Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party, and some smaller parties were against accession to the European Union in 1972. Still in 1986, these parties advocated a no vote in the Single European Act referendum. Later, the Social Liberal Party changed to a strongly EU-positive party, and EU opposition within the Social Democratic Party faded. The Socialist People&#x27;s Party were against the Amsterdam Treaty in 1998 and Denmark&#x27;s joining the euro in 2000, but has become increasingly EU-positive, for example when MEP Margrete Auken left the European United Left–Nordic Green Left and joined The Greens–European Free Alliance in 2004.

In the 2014 European Parliament election, the Danish People&#x27;s Party came first by a large margin with 27% of the vote, gaining 2 extra seats for a total of 4 MEPs. The People&#x27;s Movement against the EU polled 8%, retaining its single MEP.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Danish People&#x27;s Party lost around two-thirds of their previous vote share dropping from 4 seats to just 1. The People&#x27;s Movement against the EU lost their seat and the Red-Green Alliance got one seat.

The 2019 Danish general election saw the emergence of a new hard Eurosceptic party Nye Borgerlige which supports Denmark leaving the EU. The party won four seats in parliament.

===Estonia===
The Independence Party and Centre Party were against accession to the EU, but only the Independence Party still wants Estonia to withdraw from the EU. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party (EKRE) also has some Eurosceptic policies and increased its vote share from 4% in 2014 to 13% in the 2019 European Elections winning one seat.

===Finland===
The largest Eurosceptic party in Finland is the Finns Party. In the European Parliament election, 2014, the Finns Party increased their vote share by 3% to 13%, adding a second MEP. With their 39 seats, the Finns Party are also the second-biggest party in the 200-seat Finnish Eduskunta.

In the European Parliament election, 2019, the Finns Party increased their vote share slightly from 13% to 14% and retained their 2 seats.

In its latest party platform written in 2019, the Finns Party is strongly opposed to further EU integration. The party proposes introducing a parallel currency within Finland in tandem with the Euro in order to phase out Finnish membership of the Eurozone and argues that while Finland is needed in the short-term in the European Parliament to defend Finland&#x27;s interests, the country should also enact policies to help gradually withdraw Finland from the EU. During the 2018 Finnish presidential election, the Finns Party candidate Laura Huhtasaari stated that her campaign would support exiting the EU.

===France===

In France there are multiple parties that are Eurosceptic to different degrees, varying from advocating less EU intervention in national affairs, to advocating outright withdrawal from the EU and the Eurozone. These parties belong to all sides of the political spectrum, so the reasons for their Euroscepticism may differ. In the past many French people appeared to be uninterested in such matters, with only 40% of the French electorate voting in the 2009 European Parliament elections.

Right-wing Eurosceptic parties include the Gaullist &quot;Debout la République&quot;, and &quot;Mouvement pour la France&quot;, which was part of Libertas, a pan-European Eurosceptic party. In the 2009 European Parliament elections, Debout la République received 1.8% of the national vote, and Libertas 4.8%. In a similar way to some moderate parties, the French right and far-right in general are naturally opposed to the EU, as they criticise France&#x27;s loss of political and economic sovereignty to a supranational entity. Some of these hard Eurosceptic parties include the Popular Republican Union and The Patriots and formerly the Front National (FN). Popular Republican Union seek France&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU and the euro as well as France&#x27;s withdrawal from NATO. The FN received 33.9% of the votes in the 2017 French presidential election, making it the largest Eurosceptic party in France. In June 2018, the National Front was renamed as National Rally (RN) and in 2019 dropped support for France leaving the European Union and the Eurozone from its manifesto, instead calling for &quot;reform from within&quot; the union.

Eurosceptic parties on the left in France tend to criticise what they see as the neoliberal agenda of the EU, as well as the elements of its structure which are undemocratic and seen as top-down. These parties include the &quot;Parti de Gauche&quot; and the French Communist Party, which formed the &quot;Front de Gauche&quot; for the 2009 European Parliament elections and received 6.3% of the votes. The leader of the Left Front defends a complete reform of the Monetary Union, rather than the withdrawal of France from the Eurozone. Some of the major far-left Eurosceptic parties in France include the New Anticapitalist Party which received 4.8% and Lutte Ouvrière which received 1.2%. The Citizen and Republican Movement, a left-wing Eurosceptic and souverainist party, have not participated in any elections for the European Parliament.

The party &quot;Chasse, Pêche, Nature &amp; Traditions&quot;, is an agrarianist Eurosceptic party that says it is neither left nor right.

In the European Parliament election, 2014, the National Front won the elections with 24.9% of the vote, a swing of 18.6%, winning 24 seats, up from 3 previously. The former French President François Hollande had called for the EU to be reformed and for a scaling back of its power.

In the European Parliament election, 2019, the renamed National Rally won the elections with 23.3% of the vote, winning 22 seats, down from 23 previously when their vote share was 24.9%.

===Germany===
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is Germany&#x27;s largest Eurosceptic party. It was elected into the German Parliament with 94 seats in September 2017. Initially the AfD was a soft Eurosceptic party, that considered itself pro-Europe and pro-EU, but opposed the euro, which it believed had undermined European integration, and called for reforms to the Eurozone.

In the European Parliament election, 2014, the Alternative for Germany came 5th with 7% of the vote, winning 7 seats and is a member of the Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists Group. The Alternative for Germany went on to take seats in three state legislatures in the Autumn of 2014.

The party became purely Eurosceptic in 2015, when an internal split occurred, leading to Frauke Petry&#x27;s leadership and a more hard-line approach to the European Union, including its calling for an end for German Eurozone membership, withdrawal from EU common asylum policies and significantly reducing the power of the EU with some AfD members supporting a complete exit from the EU altogether.

In July 2015 an AfD splinter group created a new soft Eurosceptic party called Alliance for Progress and Renewal.

In the European Parliament election, 2019, the Alternative for Germany increased their vote share from 7% and 7 seats to 11% and 11 seats.

In the 2021 German Federal Election, AfD won 10.3% of the vote and 94 seats whereas in 2017, they received 12.6% of the vote and 83 seats; this meant they moved from third place to fifth place, falling behind the Green Party and FDP, both of which had been less popular than the AfD in 2017. Despite their overall electoral decline, the AfD still emerged as the largest in the states of Saxony and Thuringia, and saw a strong performance in eastern Germany.

===Greece===
Golden Dawn, Communist Party of Greece (KKE), Greek Solution, ANEL, Course of Freedom, Popular Unity, and LAOS have been the main Eurosceptic parties in Greece. According to the London School of Economics, Greece used to be the second most Eurosceptic country in the European Union, with 50% of Greeks thinking that their country has not benefited at all from the EU (only behind the UK). Meanwhile, 33% of Greeks viewed Greek membership in EU as a good thing, marginally ahead of the UK. 81% of Greeks felt that the EU was going in the wrong direction. These figures represented a major increase in Euroscepticism in Greece since 2009.

In June 2012, the Eurosceptic parties in Greece that were represented in the parliament before the Election in January 2015 (ANEL, Golden Dawn, KKE) got 45.8% of the votes and 40.3% of the seats in the parliament. In the legislative election of January 2015 the pro-European (left and right-wing) parties (ND, PASOK, Potami, KIDISO, EK and Prasinoi-DIMAR) got 43.3% of the votes. The Eurosceptic parties got 54.6%. The Eurosceptic left (KKE, ANTARSYA-MARS and KKE (M–L)/M–L KKE) got 42.6% of the votes and the Eurosceptic right (Golden Dawn, ANEL and LAOS) got 12.1% of the votes, with Syriza ahead with 36.3%. The Eurosceptic parties got 194 seats in the new parliament and the pro-EU parties got 106 seats.

According to the polls conducted in June and July 2015 (12 polls), the Eurosceptic left would get on average 48.0% (excluding extraparliamentary parties as ANTARSYA-MARS and KKE (m–l)/ML-KKE), the parliamentary pro-EU parties (Potami, New Democracy and PASOK) would get 33.8%, the extra-parliamentary (not represented in the Hellenic Parliament) pro-EU parties (KIDISO and EK) would get 4.4% and the Eurosceptic right would get 10.2% (excluding extraparliamentary parties, such as LAOS, not displayed on recent opinion polls). The soft Eurosceptic parties would get 42.3%, the hard Eurosceptic parties (including KKE, ANEL and Golden Dawn) would get 15.9%, and the pro-EU parties (including extra-parliamentary parties displayed on opinion polls) would get 38.3% of the votes.

In the European Parliament election, 2014, Syriza won the election with 26.6% of the vote (a swing of 21.9%) taking 6 seats (up 5), with Golden Dawn coming 3rd taking 3 seats, the Communist Party taking 2 seats and the Independent Greeks gaining their first ever seat. Syriza&#x27;s leader Tsipras said he&#x27;s not anti-European and does not want to leave the euro. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Tsipras is willing to negotiate with Greece&#x27;s European partners, and it is believed a Syriza victory could encourage radical leftist parties across Europe. Alexis Tsipras vowed to reverse many of the austerity measures adopted by Greece since a series of bailouts began in 2010, at odds with the Eurogroup&#x27;s positions.
The government coalition in Greece was composed by Syriza and ANEL (right-wing hard Eurosceptic party, led by Panos Kammenos, who is the current Minister of Defence).

Euroscepticism has softened in Greece as the economy improved. According to a research in early 2018, 68% of Greeks judge as positive the participation of Greece in the EU (instead of 53.5% in 2017).

In the European Parliament election, 2019, the New Democracy movement, beat the ruling left-wing Syriza formation with 33.1% and 23.8% of the vote respectively, maintaining Syriza&#x27;s 6 seats and prompting the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call a legislative election on 7 July 2019. In this election, which was won by ND, the pro-European parties (ND, SYRIZA, KINAL, MeRA25, and the extra-parliamentary Union of Centrists and Recreate Greece) got 84.9% of the vote and the Eurosceptic parties (KKE, Greek Solution, the extraparliamentary Golden Dawn and a host of other small mainly left-wing parties) got 15.1%. That drastic change in the balance is mostly the result of SYRIZA abandoning Euroscepticism.

===Hungary===

Viktor Orbán is the soft Eurosceptic Prime Minister of Hungary for the national-conservative Fidesz Party. Another Eurosceptic party that was present in Hungary was Jobbik, which until around 2016, was identified as a radical and far-right party. Those far-right factions, who left Jobbik, decided to form the Our Homeland Movement party.

In 2015, 39% of the Hungarian population had a positive image of the EU, 20% had a negative image, and 40% neutral (1% &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;).

In the 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, Fidesz got 44.5% of the votes, Jobbik got 20.5% of the votes and the communist Hungarian Workers&#x27; Party got 0.6% of the votes. Thus at the time, Eurosceptic parties in Hungary obtained 65.7% of the votes, one of the highest figures in Europe.

The green-liberal Politics Can Be Different (Lehet Más a Politika, LMP) classifies as a soft or reformist Eurosceptic party given its self-professed &quot;euro-critical&quot; stance. During the European parliamentary campaign of 2014 party Co-president András Schiffer described LMP as having a pronounced pro-integration position on environmental, wage and labour policy as supporting member state autonomy on the self-determination of local communities concerning land resources. So as to combat the differentiated integration of the multi-speed Europe which discriminates against Eastern and Southern member states, LMP would like to initiate an eco-social market economy within the union.

In the European Parliament election, 2019, Fidesz consolidated their position by increasing their vote share to 51.5% and adding a seat to take their tally to 13. Former Eurosceptic (now pro-European) Jobbik dropped to 6.3% of the votes, losing 2 of its 3 seats. The Momentum Movement, a newly created pro-European party, came 3rd with 9.3% of the vote, with the strongly pro-European Democratic Coalition coming second with 16.1% of the vote. Our Homeland Movement got 3.3% of the votes, gaining no seats.

===Ireland===

Euroscepticism is a minority view in Ireland, with opinion polls from 2016 to 2018 indicating growing support for EU membership, moving from 70% to 92% in that time.

The Irish people initially voted against ratifying the Nice and Lisbon Treaties. Following renegotiations, second referendums on both were passed with approximately 2:1 majorities in both cases. Some commentators and smaller political groups questioned the validity of the Irish Government&#x27;s decision to call second referendums.

The left-wing Irish republican party Sinn Féin expresses soft Eurosceptic positions on the current structure of the European Union and the direction in which it is moving.
The party expresses, &quot;support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda&quot;, but has a &quot;principled opposition&quot; to a European superstate. In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the EU. In the 2019 European Parliament election, Sinn Féin won one seat and 11.7% of the vote, down 7.8%.

The Socialist Party, a Trotskyist organisation, supports Ireland leaving the EU and supported the Brexit result. It argues that the European Union is institutionally capitalist and neoliberal. The Socialist Party campaigned against the Lisbon and Nice Treaties and favours the foundation of an alternative Socialist European Union.

===Italy===

The Five Star Movement (M5S), an anti-establishment movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, originally set itself out as a Eurosceptic party. The M5S received 25.5% of vote in the 2013 general election, becoming the largest anti-establishment and Eurosceptic party in Europe. The party used to advocate a non-binding referendum on the withdrawal of Italy from the Eurozone (but not from the European Union) and the return to the lira. Since then, the party has toned down its eurosceptic rhetoric and such policy was rejected in 2018, and the M5S&#x27;s leader has since stated that the &quot;European Union is the Five Star Movement&#x27;s home&quot;, clarifying that the party wants Italy to stay in the EU, even though it remains critical of some of its treaties. The M5S&#x27;s popular support is distributed all across Italy: in the 2018 general election the party won 32.7% of the popular vote nationwide, and was particularly successful in central and southern Italy.

A party that retains a Eurosceptic identity is the Northern League (LN), a regionalist movement led by Matteo Salvini favouring Italy&#x27;s exit from the Eurozone and the re-introduction of the lira. When in government, Lega approved the Treaty of Lisbon. The party won 6.2% of the vote in the 2014 European Parliament elections, but two of its leading members are presidents of Lombardy and Veneto (where Lega gained 40.9% of the vote in 2015).

In the 2014 European Parliament election the Five Star Movement came second, with 17 seats and 21.2% of the vote after contesting EP seats for the first time. Northern League had five seats and The Other Europe with Tsipras had three seats.

Other minor Eurosceptic organizations include right-wing political parties (e.g., Brothers of Italy, Tricolour Flame, New Force, National Front, CasaPound, National Movement for Sovereignty, the No Euro Movement), far-left political parties (e.g., the Communist Party of Marco Rizzo, the Italian Communist Party and the political movement Power to the People) and other political movements (e.g., the Sovereignist Front, MMT Italy). In addition, the European Union is criticized (especially for the austerity and the creation of the euro) by some left-wing thinkers, like the trade unionist Giorgio Cremaschi and the journalist Paolo Barnard, and some academics, such as Alberto Bagnai the philosopher Diego Fusaro.

According to the Standard Eurobarometer 87 conducted by the European Commission in spring 2017, 48% of Italians tend not to trust the European Union compared to 36% of Italians who do.

In the 2019 European election, the Italian Eurosceptic and souverainist right-wing, represented in large part by the League, increased its number of seats in the EP, but was not assigned any presidency in the committees of the European Parliament. Despite its national political alliance with the League during the Conte Cabinet, the Five Star Movement voted for Ursula von der Leyen, member of pro-EU Christian Democratic Union of Germany, as President of the European Commission.

In July 2020, senator Gianluigi Paragone formed Italexit, a new political party with a main goal to withdraw Italy from the European Union.

===Latvia===
The National Alliance (For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK/All for Latvia!), Union of Greens and Farmers and For Latvia from the Heart are parties that are described by some political commentators as bearing soft Eurosceptic views. A small hard Eurosceptic party exists, but it has failed to gain any administrative seats throughout history of its existence.

===Lithuania===
The Order and Justice party had mainly Eurosceptic views.

===Luxembourg===
The Alternative Democratic Reform Party is a soft Eurosceptic party. It is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists.

===Malta===
The Labour Party was not in favour of Malta entering the European Union. It was in favour of a partnership with the EU. After a long battle, the Nationalist Party led by Eddie Fenech Adami won the referendum and the following election, making Malta one of the states to enter the European Union on 1 May 2004. The party is now pro-European. Nowadays the People&#x27;s Party often adopts Eurosceptic views.

===Netherlands===
Historically, the Netherlands have been a very pro-European country, being one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952, and campaigning with much effort to include the United Kingdom into the Community in the 1970s and others after that. It has become slightly more Eurosceptic in the 2000s, rejecting the European Constitution in 2005 and complaining about the relatively high financial investment into the Union or the democratic deficit amongst other issues.

A number of hard and soft eurosceptic parties have politicians elected to the Dutch House of Representatives and European Parliament which include:
* The nationalist Party for Freedom (founded in 2006) is a hard-eurosceptic party and wants the Netherlands to leave the EU in its entirety, because it believes the EU is undemocratic, costs money and cannot close the borders for immigrants.
* The conservative and right-wing populist Forum for Democracy (FvD) party was originally founded by Thierry Baudet as a think tank to campaign against the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. In 2016, the FvD was established as a fully fledged party. It is opposed to many of the policies of the European Union and calls for a referendum on Dutch membership in which it would endorse withdrawal.
* The conservative-liberal JA21 party (founded in 2021 as a splinter from the FvD) is opposed to Dutch participation several European Union agreements, including its immigration and asylum policies, and believes Dutch identity and self-determination should be prioritized above the EU. It supports Dutch withdrawal from the Eurozone and for the Netherlands to exit EU treaties it deems a threat to national sovereignty. 
* The Socialist Party believes the European Union has already brought Europe 50 years of peace and prosperity and argues that European co-operation is essential for tackling global problems like climate change and international crime. The SP opines that the current Union is dominated by the big businesses and the big countries, while the labour movement, consumer organisations and smaller companies are often left behind. &quot;Neoliberal&quot; measures have supposedly increased social inequality, and perhaps the Union is expanding too fast and taking on too much power in issues that should be dealt with on a national level.
* The conservative Protestant Reformed Political Party and the Christian Union favour co-operation within Europe, but reject a superstate, especially one that is dominated by Catholics, or that infringes on religious rights and/or privileges.
* The pensioner&#x27;s interest party 50PLUS is moderately Eurosceptic.
* The ecologist Party for the Animals favours European co-operation, but believes the current EU does not respect animal rights enough and should have a more active policy on environment protection.
* The agrarian and rural interests Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) was founded in 2019 and is a soft-eurosceptic party. It supports membership of the EU for economic and trade purposes, but argues the political power of the EU should be stripped back so the bloc is closer to the model of the former EEC, wants reforms made to the Eurozone and is against the EU becoming a superstate.

A prominent former Eurosceptic party in the Netherlands was the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) established by politician and academic Pim Fortuyn in 2002. The party campaigned to reduce Dutch financial contributions to the EU, was against Turkish membership and opposed what it saw as the excessive bureaucracy and threat to national sovereignty posed by the EU. During the 2002 general election, the LPF polled in second place with 17% of the vote. Following the assassination of Fortuyn in the run-up to the election, support for the party declined soon after and it was disbanded in 2008 with many of is former supporters transferring to the Party for Freedom.

Despite these concerns, in 2014 the majority of the Dutch electorate continued to support parties that favour ongoing European integration: the Social Democrats, the Christian Democrats, the Liberals, but most of all the (Liberal) Democrats.

In 2016, a substantial majority in a low-turnout referendum rejected the ratification of an EU trade and association treaty with Ukraine.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, Eurosceptic parties had mixed results with Geert Wilders&#x27; Party for Freedom losing all 4 of its seats taking only 3.5% of the vote. The new Forum for Democracy established in late 2016 took 11.0% of the vote and entered the European Parliament with 3 seats.

===Poland===

The main parties with Eurosceptic views are Law and Justice (PiS), United Poland (SP) and the Confederation Liberty and Independence and the main Eurosceptic politicians include Ryszard Bender, Andrzej Grzesik, Krzysztof Bosak, Dariusz Grabowski, Janusz Korwin-Mikke, Marian Kowalski, Paweł Kukiz, Zbigniew Ziobro, Anna Sobecka, Robert Winnicki, Artur Zawisza, and Stanisław Żółtek.

Former president of Poland Lech Kaczyński resisted giving his signature on behalf of Poland to the Treaty of Lisbon, objecting specifically to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Subsequently, Poland got an opt-out from this charter. As Polish President, Kaczyński also opposed the Polish government&#x27;s intentions to join the euro.

In 2015, it was reported that Euroscepticism was growing in Poland, which was thought to be due to the &quot;economic crisis, concern over perceived interference from Brussels and migration&quot;. Polish president Andrzej Duda indicated that he wished for Poland to step back from further EU integration. He suggested that the country should &quot;hold a referendum on joining the euro, resist further integration and fight the EU&#x27;s green policies&quot;, despite getting the largest share of EU cash.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Law and Justice party won the largest number of seats, with a vote share increase up from 31.8% to 45.4%, increasing its seats from 19 to 27.

In 2019, the former MEP Stanisław Żółtek created a political party called PolEXIT, whose flagship ideology is euroscepticism. Its candidate for president of Poland in the 2020 elections was the party&#x27;s leader, Żółtek, who got 45 419 votes (0.23%), ranking 7th out of 11 candidates and did not qualify to the second round.

===Portugal===
The main Eurosceptic parties in Portugal are Chega, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and Left Bloc (BE). Opinion polling in Portugal in 2015 indicated that 48 per cent tended not to trust the EU, while 79 per cent tended not to trust the Portuguese government (then led by Portugal Ahead). Eurosceptic political parties hold a combined total of 23 seats out of 230 in Portugal&#x27;s parliament (BE 5, PCP 6, PNR 0, CHEGA 12) and a combined total of 4 out of Portugal&#x27;s 21 seats in the European Parliament (PCP 2, BE 2, PNR 0, CHEGA 0).

In the last 2014 European Parliament election, the Portuguese Communist Party won three seats and the Left Bloc won one seat.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, Left Bloc took 9.8% and gained 1 seat, Portuguese Communist Party working in coalition with Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot; took 6.9% and 2 seats and National Renovator Party (PNR) polled just 0.5%, with no seats.

2019 saw the emergence of a new Eurosceptic political party, Chega, who gained a seat in that year&#x27;s legislative election. The party did not capture any seats in the 2019 European Parliament elections, but saw its leader André Ventura finish third in the 2021 presidential election, securing 11.9% of those voting.

In the 2022 Portuguese snap election, Chega got 7.2% of the vote and 12 out of the 230 seats in the Assembly of the Republic.

===Romania===

Several parties espousing Eurosceptic views exist on the right, such as the New Republic, the Greater Romania Party and Noua Dreaptă, but as of June 2020 none of these parties are represented in European Parliament. Euroscepticism is relatively unpopular in Romania, a 2015 survey found 65% of Romanians had a positive view of the country&#x27;s EU membership.

The Eurosceptic parties remained unrepresented in the 2019 European Parliament election.

The soft Eurosceptic Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which was founded in September 2019, entered the Romanian parliament in 2020.

===Slovakia===
Parties with Eurosceptic views are the Slovak National Party, Republic, We Are Family, People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia. Prominent Slovak Eurosceptic politicians include Andrej Danko, Milan Uhrík, Boris Kollár, Marian Kotleba.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia came 3rd securing 12.1% and winning their first 2 seats in the European Parliament, whereas the Slovak National Party and We Are Family did not win any seats.

===Slovenia===
Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are Slovenian National Party and The Left. Neither won seats in the 2019 European Parliament election in Slovenia.

===Spain===

The process of Europeanization changed during the years in Spain. In 1986 Spain entered in the European Community. Since then, Spain has been one of the most Europeanist countries. Therefore, when Spain became part of the European Community, the country had a strong pro-Europeanist feeling, according to Eurobarometer, as it reflected a 60% of the population. In Spain different reasons explain its entrance to the European Community. On the one hand, democracy has just been established in Spain after Francisco Franco dictatorship. On the other hand, the main objectives of Spain were to achieve economic development, and also a social modernization. Spain was one of the few countries to vote Yes for the European Constitution in a referendum in February 2005, though by a lower margin in Catalonia and the Basque Country.

In 2008, after the financial crisis reached Spain, the percentage of pro European persons started to fall. Thus, during the five years of the economic crisis, the Eurobarometer shows how the trust in the EU increasingly fell in Spain, and the confidence of the Spanish citizens in the European Union decreased for more than 50 points. Spain became one of the most Eurosceptic countries among all European Union Members, as it happened in pretty much European countries, where nationalist and eurosceptic characterised parties became stronger.

The historical two-parties system, composed by the conservative Partido Popular and the social-democratic Partido Socialista Obrero Español, collapsed. In the 2000s, the liberal Ciudadanos and leftist party Podemos became part of the political context, gaining electoral consensus, followed years later by ultranationalist party Vox. The new parties were the effect of the disaffection of most Spaniards towards politics and politicians, that increased for several reasons: firstly, corruption at all political levels, reaching the Royal Family too; secondly, recession intensified distrust of the population towards national government; thirdly, a phase of renovation of the autonomous regions which extended the distance between the National government and the Regional ones.

Candidatura d&#x27;Unitat Popular, a left-wing to far-left political party with about 1,300 members advocates independence for Catalonia outside of the European Union. Up to 2014 European elections, there were no Spanish parties present in the Eurosceptic groups at the European Parliament. In the 2015 Spanish general election, Podemos became the first left-wing Eurosceptic political party to win seats in the Congress of Deputies, obtaining 69 seats, and in the 2019 Spanish general election, Vox became the first far-right Eurosceptic political party to win seats in the Congress of Deputies, obtaining 24 seats.

===Sweden===
The Left Party of Sweden is against accession to the eurozone and previously wanted Sweden to leave the European Union until 2019. The new party program, adapted in 2024, is highly EU-critical but states that an EU-withdrawal is only a &quot;last option&quot;. Their youth organization Young Left is still campaigning for Sweden to leave the EU.

The nationalist and right-wing populist party Sweden Democrats (SD) support closer political, economic and military cooperation with neighboring Nordic and certain Northern European countries, but strongly oppose further EU integration and further transfers of Swedish sovereignty to the EU as a whole. The party is also against Swedish accession to the eurozone, the creation of a combined EU military budget and want to renegotiate Swedish membership of the Schengen Agreement. The SD also want a constitutional amendment to require that all EU treaties must be voted on by the Swedish public first and that if the EU cannot be reformed and assumes more power at the expense of national sovereignty Sweden must exit the bloc.

The June List, a Eurosceptic list consisting of members from both the political right and left won three seats in the 2004 Elections to the European Parliament and sat in the EU-critical IND/DEM group in the European Parliament. The movement favours a withdrawal from the EU.

Around 75% of the Riksdag members represent parties that officially supports the Sweden membership.

In the European Parliament election, 2014, the Sweden Democrats gained 2 seats with 9.7% of the vote, up 6.4%, and the Left Party took one seat with 6.3% of the vote.

In the European Parliament election, 2019, the Sweden Democrats increased from 2 to 3 seats with 15.3% of the vote, up from 9.7%, and the Left Party retained its one seat with 6.8% of the vote.

In winter 2019–2020, in connection with the request from &quot;poor&quot; member countries of much higher membership fees for &quot;rich&quot; member countries, for the reason of keeping support levels so &quot;poor&quot; countries would not suffer from Brexit, where a &quot;rich&quot; country left the union in part due to high membership fees, a media and social media debate for a &quot;Swexit&quot; increased. This was still rejected by parties representing a majority of the parliament, with the COVID-19 pandemic quickly taking over the debate.

==In other European countries==

===Armenia===
Prosperous Armenia represents the main Eurosceptic party in Armenia. Following the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, the party gained 26 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the official opposition. Following the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election, the party lost all political representation and currently acts as an extra-parliamentary force. The party was a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Despite an uncritical attitude towards the EU informed by a strong Europeanizing ideology as the consequence of a lack of coherent policy agendas from local political actors, Euroscepticism exists in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An example is the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats is a Bosnian Serb political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Founded in 1996, it is the governing party in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s entity called Republika Srpska, with its leader being Milorad Dodik.

===Georgia===
Georgian March is the main Eurosceptic party in Georgia. The party supports a slight distancing of Georgia from the West, as well as rejecting the country&#x27;s entrance into NATO.

In March 2022, Georgia submitted a formal application for membership of the EU.

===Iceland===
The three main Eurosceptic parties in Iceland are the Independence Party, Left-Green Movement and the Progressive Party. The Independence Party and the Progressive Party won the parliamentary election in April 2013 and they have halted the current negotiations with the European Union regarding Icelandic membership and tabled a parliamentary resolution on 21 February 2014 to withdraw the application completely.

In 2017, Iceland&#x27;s newly elected government announced that it would hold a vote in parliament on whether to hold a referendum on resuming EU membership negotiations. In November 2017 that government was replaced by a coalition of the Independence Party, the Left Green Movement and the Progressive Party; all of whom oppose membership. Only 11 out of 63 MPs are in favour of EU membership.

===Moldova===
The main Eurosceptic parties in Moldova are the left-wing Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova, which officially declared its main purpose to be the integration of Moldova in the Eurasian Economic Union, Victory, and the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova. As of March 2022 all the parties are represented in Moldovan Parliament, with 35 MPs out of a total of 101 MPs.

In March 2022, Moldova submitted a formal application for membership of the EU.

===Montenegro===
The right-wing Democratic Front alliance are the main moderate eurosceptic subject in the Parliament of Montenegro, although its initially declaratively supported country&#x27;s bid for accession to the European Union, all other parliamentary subjects officially advocates Montenegrin access to EU. The only parties that advocates Montenegro&#x27;s rejecting the European integration are the extra-parliamentary right-wing populist to far-right parties, such as True Montenegro, Party of Serb Radicals, Democratic Party of Unity and the Serb List, all four are known for their close cooperation with the parliamentary Democratic Front.

===Norway===

Norway has rejected EU membership in two referendums, 1972 and 1994. The Centre Party, Christian Democratic Party, Socialist Left Party and Liberal Party were against EU membership in both referendums. The Liberal Party was particularly divided on the issue, and a large pro-EEC minority split off from the party before the 1972 referendum. In 2020, the Liberal Party officially reversed its position and since then, supports Norwegian EU membership.

Among the established political parties of Norway, the Centre Party, Socialist Left Party, and Red Party are also against Norway&#x27;s current membership of the European Economic Area. In addition, the libertarian Capitalist Party and Christian-conservative The Christians, both of whom have never held a seat in the Norwegian parliament, are also against Norway&#x27;s membership in the EEA.

===Russia===

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are the ruling United Russia, and opposition parties the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.

Following the annexation of Crimea, the European Union issued sanctions on the Russian Federation in response to what it regards as an &quot;illegal&quot; annexation and &quot;deliberate destabilisation&quot; of a neighbouring sovereign country. In response to this, Alexey Borodavkin – Russia&#x27;s permanent representative with the UN – said &quot;The EU is committing a direct violation of human rights by its actions against Russia. The unilateral sanctions introduced against us are not only illegitimate according to international law, they also undermine Russian citizens&#x27; freedom of travel, freedom of development, freedom of work and others&quot;. In the same year, Russian president Vladimir Putin said: &quot;What are the so-called European values? Maintaining the coup, the armed seizure of power and the suppression of dissent with the help of the armed forces?&quot;

A February 2014 poll conducted by the Levada Center, Russia&#x27;s largest independent polling organization, found that nearly 80% of Russian respondents had a &quot;good&quot; impression of the EU. This changed dramatically in 2014 with the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, resulting in 70% taking a hostile view of the EU compared to 20% viewing it positively.

A Levada poll released in August 2018 found that 68% of Russians polled believe that Russia needs to dramatically improve relations with Western countries. 42% of Russian respondents said they had a positive view of the EU, up from 28% in May 2018.

===San Marino===
A referendum was held in the landlocked microstate on 20 October 2013 in which the citizens were asked whether the country should submit an application to join the European Union. The proposal was rejected because of a low turnout, even though 50.3% of voters approved it. The &quot;Yes&quot; campaign was supported by the main left-wing parties (Socialist Party, United Left) and the Union for the Republic whereas the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party suggested voting with a blank ballot, the Popular Alliance declared itself neutral, and We Sammarinese and the RETE movement supported the &quot;No&quot; campaign. The Citizens&#x27; Rights Directive, which defines the right of free movement for the European citizens, may have been an important reason for those voting no.

===Serbia===

In Serbia, political parties with eurosceptic views tend to be right-orientated. The most notable examples are the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) which since its inception has opposed entering the European Union and the right-wing populist Dveri. Political parties such as the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) had pro-Western views and was initially supportive of the accession into the European Union but under the late 2000s leadership of Vojislav Koštunica they turned eurosceptic, and the Enough is Enough (DJB) political party, initially a liberal centrist party that also supported the accession turned towards the right-wing eurosceptic position shortly after 2018.

Historically, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) were the only two left-leaning political parties that imposed eurosceptic and anti-Western views. The ruling coalition in Serbia, Serbia Must Not Stop, which is predominantly pro-European orientated is also composed of two minor eurosceptic parties, the right-wing Serbian People&#x27;s Party that advocates closer ties to Russia, and the left-leaning Movement of Socialists which was formed as the eurosceptic split from SPS in the 2000s.

Other minor political parties in Serbia that have eurosceptic views are Healthy Serbia, People&#x27;s Freedom Movement, Russian Party, Love, Faith, Hope, Serbian Party Oathkeepers, Serbian Right, Leviathan Movement, We – Voice from the People, and We – Power of the People.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has long been known for its neutrality in international politics. Swiss voters rejected EEA membership in 1992, and EU membership in 2001. Despite the passing of several referendums calling for closer relations between Switzerland and the European Union such as the adoption of bilateral treaties and the joining of the Schengen Area, a second referendum of the joining of the EEA or the EU is not expected, and the general public remains opposed to joining.

In February 2014, the Swiss voters narrowly approved a referendum limiting the freedom of movement of EU citizens to Switzerland.

Eurosceptic political parties include the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, which is the largest political party in Switzerland, with 29.4% of the popular vote as of the 2015 federal election. Smaller Eurosceptic parties include, but are not limited to, the Federal Democratic Union, the Ticino League, and the Geneva Citizens&#x27; Movement, all of which are considered right-wing parties.

In addition, the Campaign for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland is a political organisation in Switzerland that is strongly opposed to Swiss membership of or further integration otherwise with the European Union.

Regionally, the German-speaking majority as well as the Italian-speaking areas are the most Eurosceptic, while French-speaking Switzerland tends to be more pro-European integration. In the 2001 referendum, the majority of French-speakers voted against EU membership. According to a 2016 survey conducted by M.I.S Trend and published in &quot;L&#x27;Hebdo&quot;, 69 percent of the Swiss population supports systematic border controls, and 53 percent want restrictions on the EU accord of the free movements of peoples and 14 percent want it completely abolished. 54% of the Swiss population said that if necessary, they would ultimately keep the freedom of movement of people&#x27;s accord.

===Turkey===
The two main Eurosceptic parties are the far-right ultranationalist, Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which secured 11.1% of votes, and 49 seats in the Parliament at the last election, and the Felicity Party (Saadet Partisi), a far-right Sunni Islamist party, which has no seats in the Parliament, as it only secured 0.7% of the votes in the last election, far below the 10% threshold necessary to be represented in the Parliament.

Many left-wing nationalist and far-left parties hold no seats at parliament but they control many activist and student movements in Turkey. The Patriotic Party (formerly called Workers&#x27; Party) consider the European Union as a front-runner of global imperialism.

Founded on 26 August 2021 under the leadership of Ümit Özdağ, Victory Party (Turkey) is a Turkish nationalist and anti-immigrant political party. It is represented by two deputies in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. &quot;The European Union does not want to negotiate with Turkey. We will not humiliate Turkey anymore.&quot; Özdağ said.

===Ukraine===

Parties with mainly Eurosceptic views are Opposition Platform – For Life, Opposition Bloc, Party of Shariy and Right Sector.

The far-right Ukrainian group Right Sector opposes joining the European Union. It regards the EU as an &quot;oppressor&quot; of European nations.

In the 2019 parliamentary election the Opposition Platform – For Life won 37 seats on the nationwide party list and 6 constituency seats.

The leader of the Party of Shariy Anatoly Shariy is one of the closest associates of Viktor Medvedchuk, whom Ukraine&#x27;s special services suspect of financing terrorism.

===United Kingdom===

The European Union, and Britain&#x27;s place in relation to it, is one of the primary issues today dividing opinion among the British public, political parties, media and civil society.

Euroscepticism has been an element in British politics ever since the inception of the European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor to the EU, and its salience as an issue has fluctuated widely over the years. The European Communities membership referendum of 1975 took place in the context of Conservative and Liberal parties which were generally in favour of membership (in the 1971 House of Commons vote on whether the UK should join the European Economic Community, only 39 of the then 330 Conservative MPs had been opposed to membership), and a Labour party which was sharply divided. After the referendum, which gave a strong assent to continued membership, Euroscepticism was a strand of opinion characteristic of the Labour party; at the 1983 general election, for example, Labour campaigned on a promise to withdraw from the EEC. This opposition to membership faded quickly after the election of Neil Kinnock as leader of the party, and Euroscepticism gradually came to be less popular on the left of politics than on the right - though left-wing opposition to membership continues to this day. Current and recent supporters on the left of British politics include Frank Field, Graham Stringer, Ian Austin, John Mann, Tom Harris, Gisela Stuart, Austin Mitchell, Kate Hoey and George Galloway.

When Margaret Thatcher came into power as the Prime Minister in 1979, she was as strongly in favour of membership as most Conservative MPs, having campaigned for &quot;yes&quot; in the 1975 referendum. By the time she left office, however, she had developed what at the time was a strongly Eurosceptic stance; she has been called the &quot;spiritual mother&quot; of Euroscepticism. She never argued for secession while Prime Minister, envisioning continued membership of a less integrationist EEC, and became one of the most significant Eurosceptic voices in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, influencing the Conservatives’ view on the EU. In 2009 the Conservative Party actively campaigned against the Lisbon Treaty, which it believed would give away too much sovereignty to Brussels. Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague stated that, should the treaty be in force by the time of an incoming Conservative government, he would &quot;not let matters rest there&quot;.

The right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP) was set up for the specific purpose of advocating for the UK unilaterally seceding the European Union (Brexit) from its foundation in 1993. This party initially had very little support from the UK population as a whole. It was initially eclipsed by the Referendum Party, which fought the 1997 general election on the single issue of a referendum to leave the EU. The party&#x27;s main success was found in elections to the European Parliament, where they experienced a continuous rise in their support from 1999, when they came fourth and won their first seats. In 2004 they came third, becoming the first &quot;small&quot; party to overtake the Liberals in a national vote since Labour in the 1920s. In 2009 UKIP came second, and then, in 2014, they topped the poll, pushing the Conservatives into third for the first time in their history. UKIP also had some strong support locally in solidly working class areas, with 163 councillors elected to local authorities and gaining overall control in 2015 of Thanet District Council. 

However, UKIP — like most small parties in the UK — found it almost impossible to break into Westminster politics, only ever achieving one elected MP, in 2015. Accordingly, after the inconclusive general election result of 2010, resulting in a hung Parliament, the issue of EU membership remained low on the political priority agenda at Westminster — broadly speaking a non-issue. This changed with UKIP&#x27;s victory in the 2014 European Parliament election, in the wake of which two Conservative MPs defected to UKIP. The party with the largest number of seats in the 2010 Parliament was the Conservatives, which was firstly deeply divided on the issue, being led by a pro-European leadership on the whole, but with a large number of very vociferous Eurosceptic backbenchers, and secondly concerned at UKIP&#x27;s possible electoral threat to the party at the following election. The Conservative leader David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membership in the party&#x27;s 2015 general election manifesto.

By 2015, support for the Liberal Democrats had shrunk considerably, a phenomenon widely attributed to a policy U-turn on university tuition fees. In the election, the Lib Dem vote collapsed, leading to an outright Conservative victory, to the surprise of many, as national polling had consistently predicted another hung Parliament. This majority meant that David Cameron&#x27;s pledge now had to be fulfilled. In an effort to reduce Euroscepticism, Cameron sought and gained from the EU a renegotiation of some of the terms of Britain&#x27;s EU membership, to a mixed response from the media and his party.

For the 23 June 2016 referendum on the EU membership, whilst the Conservatives had no official political policy position either way, its leader Cameron was avowedly in favour of remaining in the EU — though with the renegotiation of the terms of membership little political mileage was gained — and the party remained profoundly split, as it had been for many years.

Labour Party policy officially supported remaining in the EU, although with long-standing Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn party leader, he and his Momentum supporters gave a lacklustre defence against secession. Since first being elected in 1984 as a stalwart adherent of Eurosceptic Tony Benn on the left wing of the party, Corbin had personally advocated withdrawal throughout his terms as a Labour MP, so he suggested early on in the campaign that he would willingly consider withdrawal contrary to official party policy. The Liberal Democrats were the most adamantly pro-EU of the main parties, and since the referendum, pro-Europeanism has been their main policy.

The referendum resulted in an overall vote to leave the EU, as opposed to remaining an EU member, by 52% to 48%, on a turnout of 72%. The vote was split between the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, with a majority in England and Wales voting to leave, and a majority in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as an overwhelming 96% in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, voting to remain. As a result of the referendum, the UK Government notified the EU of its intention to withdraw on 29 March 2017 by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

On 12 April 2019, a new Eurosceptic party, the Brexit Party, was officially launched by the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, to use the 2019 European Parliament election to put pressure on a Conservative government perceived to be failing to pursue Brexit with adequate enthusiasm or success. In the event, although overall pro-EU parties score a similar share of the vote to Eurosceptic parties, the Brexit Party topped the national poll by a large margin, with 32% of the vote. The Conservatives, on the other hand, suffered their lowest ever national vote share at 9%, with just 4 seats. This historic electoral defeat – along with an inability to navigate an agreeable route between a &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; Brexit in Parliament – led to Theresa May announcing the day after the election that she would step down as the Conservatives&#x27; leader and Prime Minister on 7 June. After the elections, the Eurosceptic Blue Collar Conservative grouping of Conservative MPs was formed.

The Conservatives&#x27; resounding defeat led them to elect a new leader who might gain votes back from the Brexit Party, by pursuing a &quot;harder&quot; Brexit more determinedly than Theresa May had done. Following the election of Boris Johnson as leader in July, the Conservatives&#x27; new Cabinet became strongly supportive of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Its platform was changed to unequivocally support EU withdrawal, and there was a systematic campaign in preparation for the 2019 general election to enforce loyalty to this aim by deselecting all MPs and candidates from the party who refused to explicitly undertake to support it. The Conservatives fought the election on the slogan &quot;Get Brexit Done&quot;, a slogan which attracted strong criticism from almost all the other parties in Parliament. The election resulted in the largest overall majority for the Conservatives since the 1980s, the highest percentage of the popular vote for any party since 1979, and significant losses for the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrats.

A month later, on 23 January 2020, Parliament ratified a withdrawal agreement from the European Union, which was in turn ratified by the EU Parliament on 30 January. On 31 January, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union after 47 years. During a transition period until 31 December 2020, the UK still followed EU rules and continued free trade and free movement for people within the European Union.

== Counter-criticism ==
Ben Chu, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot;, argued against the left-wing notion that the EU is a neoliberal organization, pointing to &quot;high levels of social protection, state-owned rail companies, nationalised utilities and banks, various price controls and industrial interventions&quot;.
Unlike other left-wing critiques of the European Union—which are more focused on failure to achieve a social Europe—Hans Kundnani&#x27;s book &quot;Eurowhiteness&quot; takes aim at the goals of European integration itself, as Kundani argues that the European Union reproduces the same failings of nationalism on a larger scale.

<text>In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data: thus the rule (the estimator), the quantity of interest (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are distinguished. For example, the sample mean is a commonly used estimator of the population mean.

There are point and interval estimators. The point estimators yield single-valued results. This is in contrast to an interval estimator, where the result would be a range of plausible values. &quot;Single value&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;single number&quot;, but includes vector valued or function valued estimators.

&quot;Estimation theory&quot; is concerned with the properties of estimators; that is, with defining properties that can be used to compare different estimators (different rules for creating estimates) for the same quantity, based on the same data. Such properties can be used to determine the best rules to use under given circumstances. However, in robust statistics, statistical theory goes on to consider the balance between having good properties, if tightly defined assumptions hold, and having worse properties that hold under wider conditions.

==Background==
An &quot;estimator&quot; or &quot;point estimate&quot; is a statistic (that is, a function of the data) that is used to infer the value of an unknown parameter in a statistical model. A common way of phrasing it is &quot;the estimator is the method selected to obtain an estimate of an unknown parameter&quot;. 
The parameter being estimated is sometimes called the &quot;estimand&quot;. It can be either finite-dimensional (in parametric and semi-parametric models), or infinite-dimensional (semi-parametric and non-parametric models). If the parameter is denoted formula_1 then the estimator is traditionally written by adding a circumflex over the symbol: formula_2. Being a function of the data, the estimator is itself a random variable; a particular realization of this random variable is called the &quot;estimate&quot;. Sometimes the words &quot;estimator&quot; and &quot;estimate&quot; are used interchangeably.

The definition places virtually no restrictions on which functions of the data can be called the &quot;estimators&quot;. The attractiveness of different estimators can be judged by looking at their properties, such as unbiasedness, mean square error, consistency, asymptotic distribution, etc. The construction and comparison of estimators are the subjects of the estimation theory. In the context of decision theory, an estimator is a type of decision rule, and its performance may be evaluated through the use of loss functions.

When the word &quot;estimator&quot; is used without a qualifier, it usually refers to point estimation. The estimate in this case is a single point in the parameter space. There also exists another type of estimator: interval estimators, where the estimates are subsets of the parameter space.

The problem of density estimation arises in two applications. Firstly, in estimating the probability density functions of random variables and secondly in estimating the spectral density function of a time series. In these problems the estimates are functions that can be thought of as point estimates in an infinite dimensional space, and there are corresponding interval estimation problems.

==Definition==
Suppose a fixed &quot;parameter&quot; formula_3 needs to be estimated. Then an &quot;estimator&quot; is a function that maps the sample space to a set of &quot;sample estimates&quot;. An estimator of formula_3 is usually denoted by the symbol formula_2. It is often convenient to express the theory using the algebra of random variables: thus if &quot;X&quot; is used to denote a random variable corresponding to the observed data, the estimator (itself treated as a random variable) is symbolised as a function of that random variable, formula_6. The estimate for a particular observed data value formula_7 (i.e. for formula_8) is then formula_9, which is a fixed value. Often an abbreviated notation is used in which formula_2 is interpreted directly as a random variable, but this can cause confusion.

==Quantified properties==
The following definitions and attributes are relevant.

===Error===
For a given sample formula_11, the &quot;error&quot; of the estimator formula_2 is defined as
:formula_13
where formula_14 is the parameter being estimated. The error, &quot;e&quot;, depends not only on the estimator (the estimation formula or procedure), but also on the sample.

===Mean squared error===
The mean squared error of formula_2 is defined as the expected value (probability-weighted average, over all samples) of the squared errors; that is,
:formula_16
It is used to indicate how far, on average, the collection of estimates are from the single parameter being estimated. Consider the following analogy. Suppose the parameter is the bull&#x27;s-eye of a target, the estimator is the process of shooting arrows at the target, and the individual arrows are estimates (samples). Then high MSE means the average distance of the arrows from the bull&#x27;s eye is high, and low MSE means the average distance from the bull&#x27;s eye is low. The arrows may or may not be clustered. For example, even if all arrows hit the same point, yet grossly miss the target, the MSE is still relatively large. However, if the MSE is relatively low then the arrows are likely more highly clustered (than highly dispersed) around the target.

===Sampling deviation===
For a given sample formula_11, the &quot;sampling deviation&quot; of the estimator formula_2 is defined as
:formula_19
where formula_20 is the expected value of the estimator. The sampling deviation, &quot;d&quot;, depends not only on the estimator, but also on the sample.

===Variance===
The variance of formula_2 is the expected value of the squared sampling deviations; that is, formula_22. It is used to indicate how far, on average, the collection of estimates are from the &quot;expected value&quot; of the estimates. (Note the difference between MSE and variance.) If the parameter is the bull&#x27;s-eye of a target, and the arrows are estimates, then a relatively high variance means the arrows are dispersed, and a relatively low variance means the arrows are clustered. Even if the variance is low, the cluster of arrows may still be far off-target, and even if the variance is high, the diffuse collection of arrows may still be unbiased. Finally, even if all arrows grossly miss the target, if they nevertheless all hit the same point, the variance is zero.

===Bias===
The bias of formula_2 is defined as formula_24. It is the distance between the average of the collection of estimates, and the single parameter being estimated. The bias of formula_2 is a function of the true value of formula_3 so saying that the bias of formula_2 is formula_28 means that for every formula_3 the bias of formula_2 is formula_28.

There are two kinds of estimators: biased estimators and unbiased estimators. Whether an estimator is biased or not can be identified by the relationship between formula_32 and 0:
* If formula_33, formula_2 is biased.
* If formula_35, formula_2 is unbiased.

The bias is also the expected value of the error, since formula_37. If the parameter is the bull&#x27;s eye of a target and the arrows are estimates, then a relatively high absolute value for the bias means the average position of the arrows is off-target, and a relatively low absolute bias means the average position of the arrows is on target. They may be dispersed, or may be clustered. The relationship between bias and variance is analogous to the relationship between accuracy and precision.

The estimator formula_2 is an unbiased estimator of formula_3 if and only if formula_40. Bias is a property of the estimator, not of the estimate. Often, people refer to a &quot;biased estimate&quot; or an &quot;unbiased estimate&quot;, but they really are talking about an &quot;estimate from a biased estimator&quot;, or an &quot;estimate from an unbiased estimator&quot;. Also, people often confuse the &quot;error&quot; of a single estimate with the &quot;bias&quot; of an estimator. That the error for one estimate is large, does not mean the estimator is biased. In fact, even if all estimates have astronomical absolute values for their errors, if the expected value of the error is zero, the estimator is unbiased. Also, an estimator&#x27;s being biased does not preclude the error of an estimate from being zero in a particular instance. The ideal situation is to have an unbiased estimator with low variance, and also try to limit the number of samples where the error is extreme (that is, to have few outliers). Yet unbiasedness is not essential. Often, if just a little bias is permitted, then an estimator can be found with lower mean squared error and/or fewer outlier sample estimates.

An alternative to the version of &quot;unbiased&quot; above, is &quot;median-unbiased&quot;, where the median of the distribution of estimates agrees with the true value; thus, in the long run half the estimates will be too low and half too high. While this applies immediately only to scalar-valued estimators, it can be extended to any measure of central tendency of a distribution: see median-unbiased estimators.

In a practical problem, formula_2 can always have functional relationship with formula_3. For example, if a genetic theory states there is a type of leaf (starchy green) that occurs with probability formula_43, with formula_44.
Then, for formula_45 leaves, the random variable formula_46, or the number of starchy green leaves, can be modeled with a formula_47 distribution. The number can be used to express the following estimator for formula_3: formula_49. One can show that formula_2 is an unbiased estimator for formula_3:
formula_52
formula_53
formula_54
formula_55
formula_56
formula_57
formula_58.

===Unbiased===
A desired property for estimators is the unbiased trait where an estimator is shown to have no systematic tendency to produce estimates larger or smaller than the true parameter. Additionally, unbiased estimators with smaller variances are preferred over larger variances because it will be closer to the &quot;true&quot; value of the parameter. The unbiased estimator with the smallest variance is known as the minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE).

To find if your estimator is unbiased it is easy to follow along the equation formula_59, formula_2. With estimator &quot;T&quot; with and parameter of interest formula_3 solving the previous equation so it is shown as formula_62 the estimator is unbiased. Looking at the figure to the right despite formula_63 being the only unbiased estimator, if the distributions overlapped and were both centered around formula_3 then distribution formula_65 would actually be the preferred unbiased estimator.

Expectation
When looking at quantities in the interest of expectation for the model distribution there is an unbiased estimator which should satisfy the two equations below.
:formula_66
:formula_67
Variance
Similarly, when looking at quantities in the interest of variance as the model distribution there is also an unbiased estimator that should satisfy the two equations below.
:formula_68
:formula_69
Note we are dividing by &quot;n&quot; − 1 because if we divided with &quot;n&quot; we would obtain an estimator with a negative bias which would thus produce estimates that are too small for formula_70. It should also be mentioned that even though formula_71 is unbiased for formula_70 the reverse is not true.

===Relationships among the quantities===
*The mean squared error, variance, and bias, are related: formula_73 i.e. mean squared error = variance + square of bias. In particular, for an unbiased estimator, the variance equals the mean squared error.
*The standard deviation of an estimator formula_2 of formula_3 (the square root of the variance), or an estimate of the standard deviation of an estimator formula_2 of formula_3, is called the &quot;standard error&quot; of formula_2.
*The bias-variance tradeoff will be used in model complexity, over-fitting and under-fitting. It is mainly used in the field of supervised learning and predictive modelling to diagnose the performance of algorithms.

==Behavioral properties==

===Consistency===

A consistent estimator is an estimator whose sequence of estimates converge in probability to the quantity being estimated as the index (usually the sample size) grows without bound. In other words, increasing the sample size increases the probability of the estimator being close to the population parameter.

Mathematically, an estimator is a consistent estimator for parameter &quot;θ&quot;, if and only if for the sequence of estimates }, and for all , no matter how small, we have
:formula_79.

The consistency defined above may be called weak consistency. The sequence is &quot;strongly consistent&quot;, if it converges almost surely to the true value.

An estimator that converges to a &quot;multiple&quot; of a parameter can be made into a consistent estimator by multiplying the estimator by a scale factor, namely the true value divided by the asymptotic value of the estimator. This occurs frequently in estimation of scale parameters by measures of statistical dispersion.

===Fisher consistency===
An estimator can be considered Fisher consistent as long as the estimator is the same functional of the empirical distribution function as the true distribution function. Following the formula:
:formula_80
Where formula_81 and formula_82 are the empirical distribution function and theoretical distribution function, respectively. 
An easy example to see if some estimator is Fisher consistent is to check the consistency of mean and variance. For example, to check consistency for the mean formula_83 and to check for variance confirm that formula_84.

===Asymptotic normality===

An asymptotically normal estimator is a consistent estimator whose distribution around the true parameter &quot;θ&quot; approaches a normal distribution with standard deviation shrinking in proportion to formula_85 as the sample size &quot;n&quot; grows. Using formula_86 to denote convergence in distribution, &quot;tn&quot; is asymptotically normal if
:formula_87
for some &quot;V&quot;.

In this formulation &quot;V/n&quot; can be called the &quot;asymptotic variance&quot; of the estimator. However, some authors also call &quot;V&quot; the &quot;asymptotic variance&quot;.
Note that convergence will not necessarily have occurred for any finite &quot;n&quot;, therefore this value is only an approximation to the true variance of the estimator, while in the limit the asymptotic variance (V/n) is simply zero. To be more specific, the distribution of the estimator &quot;tn&quot; converges weakly to a dirac delta function centered at formula_3.

The central limit theorem implies asymptotic normality of the sample mean formula_89 as an estimator of the true mean.
More generally, maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically normal under fairly weak regularity conditions — see the asymptotics section of the maximum likelihood article. However, not all estimators are asymptotically normal; the simplest examples are found when the true value of a parameter lies on the boundary of the allowable parameter region.

===Efficiency===
The efficiency of an estimator is used to estimate the quantity of interest in a &quot;minimum error&quot; manner. In reality, there is not an explicit best estimator; there can only be a better estimator. Whether the efficiency of an estimator is better or not is based on the choice of a particular loss function, and it is reflected by two naturally desirable properties of estimators: to be unbiased formula_35 and have minimal mean squared error (MSE) formula_91. These cannot in general both be satisfied simultaneously: a biased estimator may have a lower mean squared error than any unbiased estimator (see estimator bias).
This equation relates the mean squared error with the estimator bias:

: formula_92

The first term represents the mean squared error; the second term represents the square of the estimator bias; and the third term represents the variance of the estimator. The quality of the estimator can be identified from the comparison between the variance, the square of the estimator bias, or the MSE. The variance of the good estimator (good efficiency) would be smaller than the variance of the bad estimator (bad efficiency). The square of an estimator bias with a good estimator would be smaller than the estimator bias with a bad estimator. The MSE of a good estimator would be smaller than the MSE of the bad estimator. Suppose there are two estimator, formula_93 is the good estimator and formula_94 is the bad estimator. The above relationship can be expressed by the following formulas.

: formula_95

: formula_96

: formula_97

Besides using formula to identify the efficiency of the estimator, it can also be identified through the graph. If an estimator is efficient, in the frequency vs. value graph, there will be a curve with high frequency at the center and low frequency on the two sides. For example:

If an estimator is not efficient, the frequency vs. value graph, there will be a relatively more gentle curve.

To put it simply, the good estimator has a narrow curve, while the bad estimator has a large curve. Plotting these two curves on one graph with a shared &quot;y&quot;-axis, the difference becomes more obvious.
Among unbiased estimators, there often exists one with the lowest variance, called the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE). In some cases an unbiased efficient estimator exists, which, in addition to having the lowest variance among unbiased estimators, satisfies the Cramér–Rao bound, which is an absolute lower bound on variance for statistics of a variable.

Concerning such &quot;best unbiased estimators&quot;, see also Cramér–Rao bound, Gauss–Markov theorem, Lehmann–Scheffé theorem, Rao–Blackwell theorem.

<text>Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds have many inclusions, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. Emerald is a cyclosilicate.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;emerald&quot; is derived (via and ), from Vulgar Latin: &quot;esmaralda/esmaraldus&quot;, a variant of Latin &quot;smaragdus&quot;, which was via (smáragdos; &quot;green gem&quot;). The Greek word may have a Semitic, Sanskrit or Persian origin. According to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; the term emerald was first used in the 14th century.

== Properties determining value ==
Emeralds, like all colored gemstones, are graded using four basic parameters known as &quot;the four &quot;C&quot;s&quot;: &quot;color&quot;, &quot;clarity,&quot; &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;carat weight&quot;. Normally, in grading colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emeralds, clarity is considered a close second. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green hue as described below, but also a high degree of transparency to be considered a top gemstone.

This member of the beryl family ranks among the traditional &quot;big four&quot; gems along with diamonds, rubies and sapphires.

In the 1960s, the American jewelry industry changed the definition of &quot;emerald&quot; to include the green vanadium-bearing beryl. As a result, &quot;vanadium emeralds&quot; purchased as emeralds in the United States are not recognized as such in the United Kingdom and Europe. In America, the distinction between traditional emeralds and the new vanadium kind is often reflected in the use of terms such as &quot;Colombian emerald&quot;.

=== Color ===

In gemology, color is divided into three components: &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;saturation&quot;, and &quot;tone&quot;. Emeralds occur in hues ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, with the primary hue necessarily being green. Yellow and blue are the normal secondary hues found in emeralds. Only gems that are medium to dark in tone are considered emeralds; light-toned gems are known instead by the species name &quot;green beryl&quot;. The finest emeralds are approximately 75% tone on a scale where 0% tone is colorless and 100% is opaque black. In addition, a fine emerald will be saturated and have a hue that is bright (vivid). Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in emeralds; a grayish-green hue is a dull-green hue.

=== Clarity ===

Emeralds tend to have numerous inclusions and surface-breaking fissures. Unlike diamonds, where the loupe standard (i.e., 10× magnification) is used to grade clarity, emeralds are graded by eye. Thus, if an emerald has no visible inclusions to the eye (assuming normal visual acuity) it is considered flawless. Stones that lack surface breaking fissures are extremely rare and therefore almost all emeralds are treated (&quot;oiled&quot;, see below) to enhance the apparent clarity. The inclusions and fissures within an emerald are sometimes described as &quot;jardin&quot; (French for &quot;garden&quot;), because of their mossy appearance. Imperfections are unique for each emerald and can be used to identify a particular stone. Eye-clean stones of a vivid primary green hue (as described above), with no more than 15% of any secondary hue or combination (either blue or yellow) of a medium-dark tone, command the highest prices. The relative non-uniformity motivates the cutting of emeralds in cabochon form, rather than faceted shapes. Faceted emeralds are most commonly given an oval cut, or the signature emerald cut, a rectangular cut with facets around the top edge.

=== Treatments ===
Most emeralds are oiled as part of the post-lapidary process, in order to fill in surface-reaching cracks so that clarity and stability are improved. Cedar oil, having a similar refractive index, is often used in this widely adopted practice. Other liquids, including synthetic oils and polymers with refractive indexes close to that of emeralds, such as &quot;Opticon&quot;, are also used. The least expensive emeralds are often treated with epoxy resins, which are effective for filling stones with many fractures. These treatments are typically applied in a vacuum chamber under mild heat, to open the pores of the stone and allow the fracture-filling agent to be absorbed more effectively. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires the disclosure of this treatment when an oil-treated emerald is sold. The use of oil is traditional and largely accepted by the gem trade, although oil-treated emeralds are worth much less than untreated emeralds of similar quality. Untreated emeralds must also be accompanied by a certificate from a licensed, independent gemology laboratory. Other treatments, for example the use of green-tinted oil, are not acceptable in the trade. Gems are graded on a four-step scale; &quot;none&quot;, &quot;minor&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;highly&quot; enhanced. These categories reflect levels of enhancement, not &quot;clarity&quot;. A gem graded &quot;none&quot; on the enhancement scale may still exhibit visible inclusions. Laboratories apply these criteria differently. Some gemologists consider the mere presence of oil or polymers to constitute enhancement. Others may ignore traces of oil if the presence of the material does not improve the look of the gemstone.

== Emerald mines ==

Emeralds in antiquity were mined in Ancient Egypt at locations on Mount Smaragdus since 1500 BC, and India and Austria since at least the 14th century AD. The Egyptian mines were exploited on an industrial scale by the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and later by Islamic conquerors. Mining in Egypt ceased with the discovery of the Colombian deposits. Today, only ruins remain in Egypt.

Colombia is by far the world&#x27;s largest producer of emeralds, constituting 50–95% of the world production, with the number depending on the year, source and grade. Emerald production in Colombia has increased drastically in the last decade, increasing by 78% from 2000 to 2010. The three main emerald mining areas in Colombia are Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Rare &quot;trapiche&quot; emeralds are found in Colombia, distinguished by ray-like spokes of dark impurities.

Zambia is the world&#x27;s second biggest producer, with its Kafubu River area deposits (Kagem Mines) about southwest of Kitwe responsible for 20% of the world&#x27;s production of gem-quality stones in 2004. In the first half of 2011, the Kagem Mines produced 3.74 tons of emeralds.

Emeralds are found all over the world in countries such as Afghanistan, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Tanzania, the United States, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In the US, emeralds have been found in Connecticut, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in the Yukon Territory of Canada.

=== Origin determinations ===
Since the onset of concerns regarding diamond origins, research has been conducted to determine if the mining location could be determined for an emerald already in circulation. Traditional research used qualitative guidelines such as an emerald&#x27;s color, style and quality of cutting, type of fracture filling, and the anthropological origins of the artifacts bearing the mineral to determine the emerald&#x27;s mine location. More recent studies using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy methods have uncovered trace chemical element differences between emeralds, including ones mined in close proximity to one another. American gemologist David Cronin and his colleagues have extensively examined the chemical signatures of emeralds resulting from fluid dynamics and subtle precipitation mechanisms, and their research demonstrated the chemical homogeneity of emeralds from the same mining location and the statistical differences that exist between emeralds from different mining locations, including those between the three locations: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor, in Colombia, South America.

== Synthetic emerald ==
Both hydrothermal and &quot;flux-growth&quot; synthetics have been produced, and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless beryl. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham, likely involving a lithium vanadate flux process, as Chatham&#x27;s emeralds do not have any water and contain traces of vanadate, molybdenum and vanadium. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., whose products have been on the market since 1964. Gilson&#x27;s emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds, which are coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run produces emerald crystals 7 mm thick.

Hydrothermal synthetic emeralds have been attributed to IG Farben, Nacken, Tairus, and others, but the first satisfactory commercial product was that of Johann Lechleitner of Innsbruck, Austria, which appeared on the market in the 1960s. These stones were initially sold under the names &quot;Emerita&quot; and &quot;Symeralds&quot;, and they were grown as a thin layer of emerald on top of natural colorless beryl stones. Later, from 1965 to 1970, the Linde Division of Union Carbide produced completely synthetic emeralds by hydrothermal synthesis. According to their patents (attributable to E.M. Flanigen), acidic conditions are essential to prevent the chromium (which is used as the colorant) from precipitating. Also, it is important that the silicon-containing nutrient be kept away from the other ingredients to prevent nucleation and confine growth to the seed crystals. Growth occurs by a diffusion-reaction process, assisted by convection. The largest producer of hydrothermal emeralds today is Tairus, which has succeeded in synthesizing emeralds with chemical composition similar to emeralds in alkaline deposits in Colombia, and whose products are thus known as “Colombian created emeralds” or “Tairus created emeralds”. Luminescence in ultraviolet light is considered a supplementary test when making a natural versus synthetic determination, as many, but not all, natural emeralds are inert to ultraviolet light. Many synthetics are also UV inert.

Synthetic emeralds are often referred to as &quot;created&quot;, as their chemical and gemological composition is the same as their natural counterparts. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has very strict regulations as to what can and what cannot be called a &quot;synthetic&quot; stone. The FTC says: &quot;§ 23.23(c) It is unfair or deceptive to use the word &quot;laboratory-grown&quot;, &quot;laboratory-created&quot;, &quot;[manufacturer name]-created&quot;, or &quot;synthetic&quot; with the name of any natural stone to describe any industry product unless such industry product has essentially the same optical, physical, and chemical properties as the stone named.&quot;

== Historical and cultural references ==
*Emerald is regarded as the traditional birthstone for May as well as the traditional gemstone for the astrological sign of Taurus.
*Traditional alchemical lore ascribes several uses and characteristics to emeralds:

The virtue of the Emerald is to counteract poison. They say that if a venomous animal should look at it, it will become blinded. The gem also acts as a preservative against epilepsy; it cures leprosy, strengthens sight and memory, checks copulation, during which act it will break, if worn at the time on the finger.

*According to French writer Brantôme ( 1540–1614) Hernán Cortés had one of the emeralds which he had looted from Mexico text engraved, &quot;Inter Natos Mulierum non surrexit major&quot; (&quot;Among those born of woman there hath not arisen a greater,&quot; Matthew 11:11), in reference to John the Baptist. Brantôme considered engraving such a beautiful and simple product of nature sacrilegious and considered this act the cause for Cortez&#x27;s loss in 1541 of an extremely precious pearl, and even for the death of King Charles IX of France, who died (1574) soon afterward.
*In American author L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, and the 1939 MGM film adaptation, the protagonist must travel to an Emerald City to meet the eponymous character, the Wizard.
*The chief deity of one of India&#x27;s most famous temples, the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, is the goddess Meenakshi, whose idol is traditionally thought to be made of emerald.

<text>The Erie Canal is a historic canal in upstate New York that runs east–west between the Hudson River and Lake Erie. Completed in 1825, the canal was the first navigable waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, vastly reducing the costs of transporting people and goods across the Appalachians. The Erie Canal accelerated the settlement of the Great Lakes region, the westward expansion of the United States, and the economic ascendancy of New York state. It has been called &quot;The Nation&#x27;s First Superhighway&quot;.

A canal from the Hudson River to the Great Lakes was first proposed in the 1780s, but a formal survey was not conducted until 1808. The New York State Legislature authorized construction in 1817. Political opponents of the canal (referencing its lead supporter New York Governor DeWitt Clinton) denigrated the project as &quot;Clinton&#x27;s Folly&quot; and &quot;Clinton&#x27;s Big Ditch&quot;. Nonetheless, the canal saw quick success upon opening on October 26, 1825, with toll revenue covering the state&#x27;s construction debt within the first year of operation. The westward connection gave New York City a strong advantage over all other U.S. ports and brought major growth to canal cities such as Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo.

The construction of the Erie Canal was a landmark civil engineering achievement in the early history of the United States. When built, the canal was the second-longest in the world after the Grand Canal in China. Initially wide and deep, the canal was expanded several times, most notably from 1905 to 1918 when the &quot;Barge Canal&quot; was built and over half the original route was abandoned. The modern Barge Canal measures long, wide, and deep. It has 34 locks, including the Waterford Flight, the steepest locks in the United States. When leaving the canal, boats must also traverse the Black Rock Lock to reach Lake Erie or the Troy Federal Lock to reach the tidal Hudson. The overall elevation difference is about .

The Erie&#x27;s peak year was 1855, when 33,000 commercial shipments took place. It continued to be competitive with railroads until about 1902, when tolls were abolished. Commercial traffic declined heavily in the latter half of the 20th century due to competition from trucking and the 1959 opening of the larger St. Lawrence Seaway. The canal&#x27;s last regularly scheduled hauler, the &quot;Day Peckinpaugh&quot;, ended service in 1994.

Today, the Erie Canal is mainly used by recreational watercraft. It connects the three other canals in the New York State Canal System: the Champlain, Oswego, and Cayuga–Seneca. Some long-distance boaters take the Erie as part of the Great Loop. The canal has also become a tourist attraction in its own right—several parks and museums are dedicated to its history. The New York State Canalway Trail is a popular cycling path that follows the canal across the state. In 2000, Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor to protect and promote the system.

==Ambiguity in name==
The waterway today referred to as the Erie Canal is quite different from the nineteenth-century Erie Canal. More than half of the original Erie Canal was destroyed or abandoned during construction of the New York State Barge Canal in the early 20th century. The sections of the original route remaining in use were widened significantly, mostly west of Syracuse, with bridges rebuilt and locks replaced. It was called the Barge Canal at the time, but that name fell into disuse with the disappearance of commercial traffic and the increase of recreational travel in the later 20th century.

==History==

===Background===
Before railroads, water transport was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods. A mule can only carry about but can draw a barge weighing as much as along a towpath. In total, a canal could cut transport costs by about 95 percent.

In the early years of the United States, transportation of goods between the coastal ports and the interior was slow and difficult. Close to the seacoast, rivers provided easy inland transport up to the fall line, since floating vessels encounter much less friction than land vehicles. However, the Appalachian Mountains were a great obstacle to further transportation or settlement, stretching from Maine to Alabama, with just five places where mule trains or wagon roads could be routed. Passengers and freight bound for the western parts of the country had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2½ weeks to travel overland from New York to Cleveland, Ohio, () and 4 weeks to Detroit ().

The principal exportable product of the Ohio Valley was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales, and later the Whiskey Rebellion. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly. In time, projects were devised in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and relatively deep into the coastal states.

====Topography====
The Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson River) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the Catskill range of the Appalachian Mountains, separating them from the geologically distinct Adirondacks to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of Alabama. A navigable canal through the Mohawk Valley would allow an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Via the canal and these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent&#x27;s interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.


===Conception===

Among the first attempts made by European colonists to improve upon the future state&#x27;s navigable waterways was the construction in 1702 of the Wood Creek Carry, or Oneida Carry a short portage road connecting Wood Creek to the Mohawk River near modern-day Rome, New York. However, the first documented instance of the idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements via New York&#x27;s waterways was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official Cadwallader Colden made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York. Colden and subsequent figures in the history of the Erie Canal and its development would draw inspiration from other great works of the so-called &quot;canal age,&quot; including France&#x27;s Canal du Midi and the Bridgewater Canal in England. The attempt in the 1780s by George Washington to build a canal from the tidewaters of the Potomac into the fledgling nation&#x27;s interior was also well known to the planners of the Erie Canal.

Gouverneur Morris and Elkanah Watson were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the &quot;Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies&quot; in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario, but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient. Christopher Colles, who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal, surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from Lake Ontario. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.

Jesse Hawley had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the Eastern seaboard. However, he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast. While in Canandaigua debtors&#x27; prison, Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the Mohawk River valley with support from Joseph Ellicott (agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.

New York legislators became interested in the possibility of building a canal across New York in the first decade of the 19th century. Shipping goods west from Albany was a costly and tedious affair; there was no railroad yet, and to cover the distance from Buffalo to New York City by stagecoach took two weeks. The problem was that the land rises about from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to of lift, so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts, fifty locks would be required along the canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President Thomas Jefferson called it &quot;little short of madness&quot; and rejected it.

Eventually, Hawley interested New York Governor DeWitt Clinton in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as &quot;Clinton&#x27;s folly&quot; and &quot;Clinton&#x27;s ditch&quot;. In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7 million for construction.

===Construction===

The original canal was long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut wide and deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath. Its construction, through limestone and mountains, proved a daunting task. To move earth, animals pulled a &quot;slip scraper&quot; (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The Canal was built by Irish laborers and German stonemasons. All labor on the canal depended upon human and animal power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water; one aqueduct was long to span of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.

The men who planned and oversaw construction were novices as surveyors and as engineers. There were no civil engineers in the United States. James Geddes and Benjamin Wright, who laid out the route, were judges whose experience in surveying was in settling boundary disputes. Geddes had only used a surveying instrument for a few hours before his work on the Canal. Canvass White was a 27-year-old amateur engineer who persuaded Clinton to let him go to Britain at his own expense to study the canal system there. Nathan Roberts was a mathematics teacher and land speculator. Yet these men &quot;carried the Erie Canal up the Niagara escarpment at Lockport, maneuvered it onto a towering embankment to cross over Irondequoit Creek, spanned the Genesee River on an awesome aqueduct, and carved a route for it out of the solid rock between Little Falls and Schenectady—and all of those venturesome designs worked precisely as planned&quot;.

Construction began on July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first , from Rome to Utica, opened in 1819. At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller. Two huge wheels were mounted loose on the ends of an axle. A third wheel, slightly smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses and mules could build a mile in a year.

The remaining problem was finding labor; increased immigration helped fill the need. Many of the laborers working on the canal were Irish, who had recently come to the United States as a group of about 5,000. Most of them were Roman Catholic, a religion that raised much suspicion in early America because of its hierarchic structure, and many laborers on the canal suffered violent assault as the result of misjudgment and xenophobia.

Construction continued at an increased rate as new workers arrived. When the canal reached Montezuma Marsh (at the outlet of Cayuga Lake west of Syracuse), it was rumored that over 1,000 workers died of &quot;swamp fever&quot; (malaria), and construction was temporarily stopped. However, recent research has revealed that the death toll was likely much lower, as no contemporary reports mention significant worker mortality, and mass graves from the period have never been found in the area. Work continued on the downhill side towards the Hudson, and the crews worked on the section across the swampland when it froze in winter.

The middle section from Utica to Salina (Syracuse) was completed in 1820, and traffic on that section started up immediately. Expansion to the east and west proceeded simultaneously, and the whole eastern section, from Brockport to Albany, opened on September 10, 1823, to great fanfare. The Champlain Canal, a separate but connected north–south route from Watervliet on the Hudson to Lake Champlain, opened on the same date.

After Montezuma Marsh, the next difficulties were crossing Irondequoit Creek and the Genesee River near Rochester. The former ultimately required building the long &quot;Great Embankment&quot;, to carry the canal at a height of above the level of the creek, which ran through a culvert underneath. The canal crossed the river on a stone aqueduct, long and wide, supported by 11 arches.

In 1823 construction reached the Niagara Escarpment, an -high wall of hard dolomitic limestone. The route followed the channel of a creek that had cut a ravine steeply down the escarpment. The construction and operation of two sets of five locks along a corridor soon gave rise to the community of Lockport. The lift-locks had a total lift of , exiting into a deeply cut channel. The final leg had to be cut deep through another limestone mass, the Onondaga ridge. Much of that section was blasted with black powder, and the inexperience of the crews often led to accidents, and sometimes to rocks falling on nearby homes.

Two villages competed to be the terminus: Black Rock, on the Niagara River, and Buffalo, at the eastern tip of Lake Erie. Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen Buffalo Creek to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually annexing its former rival.

===Completion===

In 1824, before the canal was completed, a detailed &quot;Pocket Guide for the Tourist and Traveler, Along the Line of the Canals, and the Interior Commerce of the State of New York&quot;, was published for the benefit of travelers and land speculators.

The entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide &quot;Grand Celebration&quot;, culminating in a series of cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute cannonade from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard &quot;Seneca Chief&quot;, sailed from Buffalo to New York City over ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the &quot;Wedding of the Waters&quot;. On its return trip, &quot;Seneca Chief&quot; brought back a keg of Atlantic Ocean water, which was poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo&#x27;s Judge Samuel Wilkeson, who would later become mayor.

The Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a total length of and cost $7.143 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City develop as an international trade center.

Problems developed but were quickly solved. Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using cement that hardened underwater (hydraulic cement). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to .

===Branch canals===

Additional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the Finger Lakes, the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at Oswego, and the Champlain Canal from Troy north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake. The Chemung Canal connected the south end of Seneca Lake to Elmira in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania coal and timber into the canal system. The Chenango Canal in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to Binghamton and caused a business boom in the Chenango River valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the Susquehanna River system. The Black River Canal connected the Black River to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The Genesee Valley Canal was run along the Genesee River to connect with the Allegheny River at Olean, but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.

===First enlargement===

The original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5 million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from and deepened from . Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new navigable aqueducts were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.

===Railroad competition===

The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the New York Central Railroad and its Auburn Road in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined. The New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway was completed in 1884, as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the New York Central Railroad. However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central. The canal continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.

===Barge Canal===

In a November 3, 1903 referendum, a majority of New Yorkers authorized an expansion of the canal at a cost of $101,000,000.
In 1905, construction of the New York State Barge Canal began, which was completed in 1918, at a cost of $96.7 million.

This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to canalize rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, Seneca, and Clyde rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to wide and deep. The expansion allowed barges up to to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.

===Commercial decline===
Freight traffic reached a total of 5.2 million short tons (4.7 million metric tons) by 1951. The growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic.

===New York State Canal System===

In 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the New York State Canal System (including the Erie, Cayuga-Seneca, Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created New York State Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority. While part of the Thruway, the canal system was operated using money generated by Thruway tolls. In 2017, the New York State Canal Corporation was transferred from the New York State Thruway to the New York Power Authority.

In 2000, Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor, covering of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the Capital Region and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7 million; about 75% of Central and Western New York&#x27;s population lives within of the Erie Canal.

There were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal&#x27;s peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo and a truck . Canal barges can carry loads up to , and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment. In 2012, the New York State Canal System as a whole was used to ship 42,000 tons of cargo.

Travel on the canal&#x27;s middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.

==Route==
===Original Canal===

The Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York&#x27;s unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the Appalachians south of the St. Lawrence River. The Hudson is tidal to Troy, and Albany is west of the Appalachians. It allowed for east–west navigation from the coast to the Great Lakes within US territory.

The canal began on the west side of the Hudson River at Albany, and ran north to Watervliet, where the Champlain Canal branched off. At Cohoes, it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River—16 locks rising —and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at Crescent and again to the south at Rexford. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.

At Rome, the canal continued west parallel to Wood Creek, which flows westward into Oneida Lake, and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From Canastota west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the Onondaga Escarpment, passing through Syracuse, Onondaga Lake, and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of Irondequoit Creek. At Lockport the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the Niagara Escarpment, using the ravine of Eighteen Mile Creek.

The canal continued south-southwest to Pendleton, where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of Tonawanda Creek. From the Tonawanda south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its &quot;Western Terminus&quot; at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the Commercial Slip), which discharged into the Buffalo River just above its confluence with Lake Erie. With Buffalo&#x27;s re-excavation of the Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal&#x27;s original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.

===Barge Canal===

The new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and Waterford, where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called &quot;Waterford Flight&quot;), running into the Mohawk River east of Crescent. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.

While the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary. At Ilion, the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with Fish Creek just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.

From Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the Oneida River, with cutoffs to shorten the route. At Three Rivers, the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the Montezuma Marsh. There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At Pittsford, southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the Genesee River at the Genesee Valley Park, then rejoins the old path near North Gates.

From there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport. This reach of from Henrietta to Lockport is called &quot;the 60‑mile level&quot; since there are no locks and the water level rises only over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal&#x27;s level. It runs southwest to Tonawanda, where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the New York Barge Canal&#x27;s Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal&#x27;s original &quot;Western Terminus&quot; at Buffalo&#x27;s Inner Harbor.

==Operations==
===Freight boats===

Canal boats up to in draft were pulled by horses and mules walking on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When canal boats met, the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or &quot;hoggee&quot;, pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat coasted with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat&#x27;s team would step over the other boat&#x27;s towline, with its horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat&#x27;s team would continue on its way.

Pulled by teams of horses, canal boats moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the smooth, nonstop method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Migrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck or on top of crates.

===Passenger boats===

Packet boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stagecoach wagons. These boats, measuring up to long and wide, made ingenious use of space, accommodating up to 40 passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime. The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with books and current newspapers, served as sitting rooms during the days. At mealtimes, crews transformed the cabin into a dining room. Drawing a curtain across the width of the room divided the cabin into ladies&#x27; and gentlemen&#x27;s sleeping quarters at night. Pull-down tiered beds folded from the walls, and additional cots could be hung from hooks in the ceiling. Some captains hired musicians and held dances.

===Sunday closing debate===
In 1858, the New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill&#x27;s opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, so it was with the canal.

==Impact==
=== Economic impact ===

The Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Midwest more economically. To give an example, the cost to transport a barrel of flour from Rochester to Albany dropped from $3 (before the canal) to 75¢ on the canal. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Midwest. Because of this vital connection and others to follow, such as the railroads, New York would become known as the &quot;Empire State&quot; or &quot;the great Empire State&quot;.

The Erie Canal was an immediate success. Tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state&#x27;s construction debt in its first year of official operation. By 1828, import duties collected at the New York Customs House supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in Washington except the interest on the national debt. Additionally, New York State&#x27;s initial loan for the original canal had been paid by 1837. Although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats, passengers also traveled on the canal&#x27;s packet boats. In 1825 more than 40,000 passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel. The canal&#x27;s steady flow of tourists, businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors. Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region, and the canal served as the last leg of the Underground Railroad ferrying freedom seekers to Buffalo near the Canada–US border. Aspiring merchants found that tourists were reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit, while less scrupulous &quot;confidence men&quot; sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills. Tourists were carried along the &quot;northern tour,&quot; which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.

As the canal brought travelers to New York City, it took business away from other ports such as Philadelphia and Baltimore. Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the Main Line of Public Works was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, opened in 1834. In Maryland, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran west to Wheeling, West Virginia, then a part of Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.

The canal played a major role in the growth of Standard Oil, as founder John D. Rockefeller used the canal as a cheaper form of transportation – in the summer months when it was not frozen – to get his refined oil from Cleveland to New York City. In the winter months his only options were the three trunk lines: the Erie Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, or the Pennsylvania Railroad.

=== Migratory impact ===
New ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. A plaque honoring the canal&#x27;s construction is located in Battery Park in southern Manhattan.

Because so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many genealogists have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827–1829, canal boat operators were not required to record passenger names or report them to the New York government. Some passenger lists survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.

The canal allowed Buffalo to grow from just 200 settlers in 1820 to more than 18,000 people by 1840.

=== Cultural impact ===

The Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. Repeal of Britain&#x27;s Corn Law resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the repeal and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854. Much of this trade flowed along the Erie.

Its success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. Chicago, among other Great Lakes cities, recognized the importance of the canal to its economy, and two West Loop streets are named &quot;Canal&quot; and &quot;Clinton&quot; (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).

Concern that erosion caused by logging in the Adirondacks could silt up the canal contributed to the creation in 1885 of another New York National Historic Landmark, the Adirondack Park.

Many notable authors wrote about the canal, including Herman Melville, Frances Trollope, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Samuel Hopkins Adams and the Marquis de Lafayette, and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song &quot;Low Bridge, Everybody Down&quot; by Thomas S. Allen was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal&#x27;s early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.

Consisting of a massive stone aqueduct that carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign tourists. This is shown in Scene 4 of William Dunlap&#x27;s play &quot;A Trip to Niagara&quot;, where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could experience a combination of artificial and natural sights. Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some who saw movement on the canal as tedious.

The Erie Canal changed property law in New York. Most importantly, it expanded the government&#x27;s right to take private property. Cases surrounding the newly built Erie Canal expanded condemnation theory to permit canal builders to appropriate private land and broadened the meaning of &quot;public use&quot; in the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The canal also had an impact on water access jurisprudence as well as nuisance law.

==The canal today==
Today, the Erie Canal is used primarily by recreational vessels, though it remains served by several commercial barge-towing companies.

The canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the Chambly Canal, and Richelieu River in Canada form the Lakes to Locks Passage, making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were suspended to attract more visitors.

The Erie Canal is a destination for tourists from all over the world, and has inspired guidebooks dedicated to exploration of the waterway. An Erie Canal Cruise company, based in Herkimer, operates from mid-May until mid-October with daily cruises. The cruise goes through the history of the canal and also takes passengers through Lock 18.

Aside from transportation, numerous businesses, farms, factories and communities alongside its banks still utilize the canal&#x27;s waters for other purposes such as irrigation for farmland, hydroelectricity, research, industry, and even drinking. Use of the canal system has an estimated total economic impact of $6.2 billion annually.

===Old Erie Canal===
Today, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the &quot;Improved Erie Canal&quot; or the &quot;Old Erie Canal&quot;, to distinguish it from the canal&#x27;s modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are officially referred to today as &quot;Clinton&#x27;s Ditch&quot; (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817–1825 construction).

Sections of the Old Erie Canal not used after 1918 are owned by New York State, or have been ceded to or purchased by counties or municipalities. Many stretches of the old canal have been filled in to create roads such as Erie Boulevard in Syracuse and Schenectady, and Broad Street and the Rochester Subway in Rochester. A 36‑mile (58 km) stretch of the old canal from the town of DeWitt, New York, east of Syracuse, to just outside Rome, New York, is preserved as the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park. In 1960 the Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site, a section of the canal in Montgomery County, was one of the first sites recognized as a National Historic Landmark.

Some municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks, or have plans to do so. Camillus Erie Canal Park preserves a stretch and has restored Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct, built in 1841 as part of the First Enlargement of the canal. In some communities, the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris. Proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown Rochester or Syracuse as a tourist attraction. In Syracuse, the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown&#x27;s Clinton Square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure, now dry. Buffalo&#x27;s Commercial Slip is the restored and re-watered segment of the canal which formed its &quot;Western Terminus&quot;.

In 2004, the administration of New York Governor George Pataki was criticized when officials of New York State Canal Corporation attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the Old Erie Canal to a single developer for $30,000, far less than the land was worth on the open market. After an investigation by the &quot;Syracuse Post-Standard&quot; newspaper, the Pataki administration nullified the deal.

===Erie Canalway Trail===
===Records and research===
Records of the planning, funding, design, construction, and administration of the Erie Canal are vast and can be found in the New York State Archives. Except for two years (1827–1829), the State of New York did not require canal boat operators to maintain or submit passenger lists.

==Locks==
The following list of locks is provided for the current canal, from east to west. There are a total of 36 (35 numbered) locks on the Erie Canal.

All locks on the New York State Canal System are single-chamber; the dimensions are long and wide with a minimum depth of water over the miter sills at the upstream gates upon lift. They can accommodate a vessel up to long and wide. Overall sidewall height will vary by lock, ranging between depending on the lift and navigable stages. Lock E17 at Little Falls has the tallest sidewall height at .

Distance is based on position markers from an interactive canal map provided online by the New York State Canal Corporation and may not exactly match specifications on signs posted along the canal. Mean surface elevations are comprised from a combination of older canal profiles and history books as well as specifications on signs posted along the canal. The margin of error should normally be within .

The Waterford Flight series of locks (comprising Locks E2 through E6) is one of the steepest in the world, lifting boats in less than .

&quot;All surface elevations are approximate.&quot;


 Denotes federally managed locks.

There is a natural rise between locks E33 and E34 as well as a natural rise between Lock E35 and the Niagara River.

There is no Lock E1 or Lock E31 on the Erie Canal. The place of &quot;Lock E1&quot; on the passage from the lower Hudson River to Lake Erie is taken by the Troy Federal Lock, located just north of Troy, New York, and is not part of the Erie Canal System proper. It is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Erie Canal officially begins at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers at Waterford, New York.

Although the original alignment of the Erie Canal through Buffalo has been filled in, travel by water is still possible from Buffalo via the Black Rock Lock in the Niagara River to the canal&#x27;s modern western terminus in Tonawanda, and eastward to Albany. The Black Rock Lock is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

Oneida Lake lies between locks E22 and E23, and has a mean surface elevation of . Lake Erie has a mean surface elevation of .

<doc id="10048" wikidata="Q153" url="?curid=10048" title="Ethanol">
<text>Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol) is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is an alcohol, with its formula also written as , or EtOH, where Et stands for ethyl. Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a characteristic wine-like odor and pungent taste.
As a psychoactive depressant, it is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, and the second most consumed drug globally behind caffeine.

Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation process of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes such as ethylene hydration. Historically it was used as a general anesthetic, and has modern medical applications as an antiseptic, disinfectant, solvent for some medications, and antidote for methanol poisoning and ethylene glycol poisoning. It is used as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds, and as a fuel source for lamps, stoves, and internal combustion engines. Ethanol also can be dehydrated to make ethylene, an important chemical feedstock. As of 2023, world production of ethanol fuel was , coming mostly from the U.S. (51%) and Brazil (26%).

== Name ==
&quot;Ethanol&quot; is the systematic name defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry for a compound consisting of an alkyl group with two carbon atoms (prefix &quot;eth-&quot;), having a single bond between them (infix &quot;-an-&quot;) and an attached −OH functional group (suffix &quot;-ol&quot;).

The &quot;eth-&quot; prefix and the qualifier &quot;ethyl&quot; in &quot;ethyl alcohol&quot; originally came from the name &quot;ethyl&quot; assigned in 1834 to the group − by Justus Liebig. He coined the word from the German name &quot;Aether&quot; of the compound −O− (commonly called &quot;ether&quot; in English, more specifically called &quot;diethyl ether&quot;). According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Ethyl&quot; is a contraction of the Ancient Greek (&#x27;, &quot;upper air&quot;) and the Greek word (&#x27;, &quot;wood, raw material&quot;, hence &quot;matter, substance&quot;). &quot;Ethanol&quot; was coined as a result of a resolution on naming alcohols and phenols that was adopted at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April 1892 in Geneva, Switzerland.

The term &quot;alcohol&quot; now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature, but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol. It is a medieval loan from Arabic , a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic, and retained that meaning in Middle Latin. The use of &#x27;alcohol&#x27; for ethanol (in full, &quot;alcohol of wine&quot;) was first recorded in 1753. Before the late 18th century the term &quot;alcohol&quot; generally referred to any sublimated substance.

== Uses ==
=== Recreational drug ===

As a central nervous system depressant, ethanol is one of the most commonly consumed psychoactive drugs. Despite alcohol&#x27;s psychoactive, addictive, and carcinogenic properties, it is readily available and legal for sale in many countries. There are laws regulating the sale, exportation/importation, taxation, manufacturing, consumption, and possession of alcoholic beverages. The most common regulation is prohibition for minors.

In mammals, ethanol is primarily metabolized in the liver and stomach by ADH enzymes. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of ethanol into acetaldehyde (ethanal):

:CH3CH2OH + NAD+ → CH3CHO + NADH + H+

When present in significant concentrations, this metabolism of ethanol is additionally aided by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 in humans, while trace amounts are also metabolized by catalase. The resulting intermediate, acetaldehyde, is a known carcinogen, and poses significantly greater toxicity in humans than ethanol itself. Many of the symptoms typically associated with alcohol intoxication—as well as many of the health hazards typically associated with the long-term consumption of ethanol—can be attributed to acetaldehyde toxicity in humans.

The subsequent oxidation of acetaldehyde into acetate is performed by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes. A mutation in the ALDH2 gene that encodes for an inactive or dysfunctional form of this enzyme affects roughly 50 % of east Asian populations, contributing to the characteristic alcohol flush reaction that can cause temporary reddening of the skin as well as a number of related, and often unpleasant, symptoms of acetaldehyde toxicity. This mutation is typically accompanied by another mutation in the ADH enzyme ADH1B in roughly 80 % of east Asians, which improves the catalytic efficiency of converting ethanol into acetaldehyde.

=== Medical ===

Ethanol is the oldest known sedative, used as an oral general anesthetic during surgery in ancient Mesopotamia and in medieval times. Mild intoxication starts at a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03-0.05 % and induces anesthetic coma at 0.4%. This use carries the high risk of deadly alcohol intoxication, pulmonary aspiration and vomiting, which led to use of alternatives in antiquity, such as opium and cannabis, and later diethyl ether, starting in the 1840s.

Ethanol is used as an antiseptic in medical wipes and hand sanitizer gels for its bactericidal and anti-fungal effects. Ethanol kills microorganisms by dissolving their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins, and is effective against most bacteria, fungi and viruses. It is ineffective against bacterial spores, which can be treated with hydrogen peroxide.

A solution of 70% ethanol is more effective than pure ethanol because ethanol relies on water molecules for optimal antimicrobial activity. Absolute ethanol may inactivate microbes without destroying them because the alcohol is unable to fully permeate the microbe&#x27;s membrane. Ethanol can also be used as a disinfectant and antiseptic by inducing cell dehydration through disruption of the osmotic balance across the cell membrane, causing water to leave the cell, leading to cell death.

Ethanol may be administered as an antidote to ethylene glycol poisoning and methanol poisoning. It does so by acting as a competitive inhibitor against methanol and ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Though it has more side effects, ethanol is less expensive and more readily available than fomepizole in the role.

Ethanol is used to dissolve many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of pain medications, cough and cold medicines, and mouth washes, for example, may contain up to 25% ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions. Ethanol is present mainly as an antimicrobial preservative in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen, iron supplements, ranitidine, furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine.

Some medicinal solutions of ethanol are also known as tinctures.

=== Energy source ===


The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive. Brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel, due in part to its role as one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of ethanol. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline-fueled cars sold in the country.

The US and many other countries primarily use E10 (10% ethanol, sometimes known as gasohol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures. Over time, it is believed that a material portion of the ≈ per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol.

Australian law limits the use of pure ethanol from sugarcane waste to 10 % in automobiles. Older cars (and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning fuel) should have the engine valves upgraded or replaced.

According to an industry advocacy group, ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, and other ozone-forming pollutants. Argonne National Laboratory analyzed greenhouse gas emissions of many different engine and fuel combinations, and found that biodiesel/petrodiesel blend (B20) showed a reduction of 8%, conventional E85 ethanol blend a reduction of 17% and cellulosic ethanol 64%, compared with pure gasoline. Ethanol has a much greater research octane number (RON) than gasoline, meaning it is less prone to pre-ignition, allowing for better ignition advance which means more torque, and efficiency in addition to the lower carbon emissions.

Ethanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde. This leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone. This data has been assembled into The Clean Fuels Report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates 2.14 times as much ozone as gasoline exhaust. When this is added into the custom &quot;Localized Pollution Index&quot; of The Clean Fuels Report, the local pollution of ethanol (pollution that contributes to smog) is rated 1.7, where gasoline is 1.0 and higher numbers signify greater pollution. The California Air Resources Board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group, much like the conventional NOx and reactive organic gases (ROGs).

More than 20% of Brazilian cars are able to use 100% ethanol as fuel, which includes ethanol-only engines and flex-fuel engines. Flex-fuel engines in Brazil are able to work with all ethanol, all gasoline or any mixture of both. In the United States, flex-fuel vehicles can run on 0% to 85% ethanol (15% gasoline) since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient. Brazil supports this fleet of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugarcane.

Ethanol&#x27;s high miscibility with water makes it unsuitable for shipping through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons. Mechanics have seen increased cases of damage to small engines (in particular, the carburetor) and attribute the damage to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel.

Ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket (liquid-propelled) vehicles, in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen. The German A-4 ballistic rocket of World War II (better known by its propaganda name ), which is credited as having begun the space age, used ethanol as the main constituent of . Under such nomenclature, the ethanol was mixed with 25% water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature. The design team helped develop U.S. rockets following World War II, including the ethanol-fueled Redstone rocket, which launched the first U.S. astronaut on suborbital spaceflight. Alcohols fell into general disuse as more energy-dense rocket fuels were developed, although ethanol was used in recent experimental lightweight rocket-powered racing aircraft.

Commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas, hydrogen or methanol. Ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There is a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have entered trials including direct-ethanol fuel cells, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of the commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.

Ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration. Ethanol can also be used as stove fuel for cooking.

===Other uses===

Ethanol is an important industrial ingredient. It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl halides, ethyl esters, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and ethyl amines. It is considered a universal solvent, as its molecular structure allows for the dissolving of both polar, hydrophilic and nonpolar, hydrophobic compounds. As ethanol also has a low boiling point, it is easy to remove from a solution that has been used to dissolve other compounds, making it a popular extracting agent for botanical oils. Cannabis oil extraction methods often use ethanol as an extraction solvent, and also as a post-processing solvent to remove oils, waxes, and chlorophyll from solution in a process known as winterization.

Ethanol is found in paints, tinctures, markers, personal care products such as mouthwashes, perfumes and deodorants, and wet specimen preservatives. Polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol, and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of DNA and RNA. Because of its low freezing point of and low toxicity, ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories (with dry ice or other coolants) as a cooling bath to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water. For the same reason, it is also used as the active fluid in alcohol thermometers.

== Chemistry ==

Ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol. Its molecular formula is CH3CH2OH. The structure of the molecule of ethanol is (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group (CH3−) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (−CH2–), which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (−OH). It is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether. Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as EtOH, using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (C2H5−) with Et.

=== Physical properties ===
Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a slight odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol&#x27;s hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as propane. Ethanol&#x27;s adiabatic flame temperature for combustion in air is 2082 °C or 3779 °F.

Ethanol is slightly more refractive than water, having a refractive index of 1.36242 (at λ=589.3 nm and ). The triple point for ethanol is .

=== Solvent properties ===
Ethanol is a versatile solvent, miscible with water and with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene. Its main use as a solvent is in making tincture of iodine, cough syrups, etc. It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.

Ethanol&#x27;s miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer-chain alcohols (five or more carbon atoms), whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases. The miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane: mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature (about 13 °C for dodecane). The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes, and the temperature for complete miscibility increases.

Ethanol-water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions. Mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only 1.92 volumes of mixture. Mixing ethanol and water is exothermic, with up to 777 J/mol being released at 298 K.

Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and potassium hydroxides, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide. Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.

The addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water. This property partially explains the &quot;tears of wine&quot; phenomenon. When wine is swirled in a glass, ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass. As the wine&#x27;s ethanol content decreases, its surface tension increases and the thin film &quot;beads up&quot; and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet.

=== Azeotrope with water ===
At atmospheric pressure, mixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about 89.4 mol% ethanol (95.6% ethanol by mass, 97% alcohol by volume), with a boiling point of 351.3 K (78.1 °C). At lower pressure, the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures. The minimum-pressure azeotrope has an ethanol fraction of 100% and a boiling point of 306 K (33 °C), corresponding to a pressure of roughly 70 torr (9.333 kPa). Below this pressure, there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture.

=== Flammability ===
An ethanol–water solution will catch fire if heated above a temperature called its flash point and an ignition source is then applied to it. For 20% alcohol by mass (about 25% by volume), this will occur at about . The flash point of pure ethanol is , but may be influenced very slightly by atmospheric composition such as pressure and humidity. Ethanol mixtures can ignite below average room temperature. Ethanol is considered a flammable liquid (Class 3 Hazardous Material) in concentrations above 2.35% by mass (3.0% by volume; 6 proof). Dishes using burning alcohol for culinary effects are called flambé.


== Natural occurrence ==
Ethanol is a byproduct of the metabolic process of yeast. As such, ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat. Ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit. Ethanol produced by symbiotic yeast can be found in bertam palm blossoms. Although some animal species, such as the pentailed treeshrew, exhibit ethanol-seeking behaviors, most show no interest or avoidance of food sources containing ethanol. Ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anaerobiosis.

Ethanol has been detected in outer space, forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar clouds.
Minute quantity amounts (average 196 ppb) of endogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde were found in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers. Auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through endogenous fermentation within the digestive system.

== Production ==
Ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene and, via biological processes, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks.

=== Sources ===
World production of ethanol in 2006 was , with 69% of the world supply coming from Brazil and the U.S. Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugarcane, which has relatively high yields (830% more fuel than the fossil fuels used to produce it) compared to some other energy crops. Sugarcane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn (by about 30%), but is also much easier to extract. The bagasse generated by the process is not discarded, but burned by power plants to produce electricity. Bagasse burning accounts for around 9% of the electricity produced in Brazil.

In the 1970s most industrial ethanol in the U.S. was made as a petrochemical, but in the 1980s the U.S. introduced subsidies for corn-based ethanol. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, as of 30 October 2007, 131 grain ethanol bio-refineries in the U.S. have the capacity to produce of ethanol per year. An additional 72 construction projects underway (in the U.S.) can add of new capacity in the next 18 months.

In India ethanol is made from sugarcane. Sweet sorghum is another potential source of ethanol, and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics is investigating the possibility of growing sorghum as a source of fuel, food, and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa. Sweet sorghum has one-third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period. It also requires about 22% less water than corn. The world&#x27;s first sweet sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in 2007 in Andhra Pradesh, India.

Ethanol has been produced in the laboratory by converting carbon dioxide via biological and electrochemical reactions.

=== Hydration ===
Ethanol can be produced from petrochemical feed stocks, primarily by the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene. It is often referred to as synthetic ethanol.

The catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid, adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth. This catalyst was first used for large-scale ethanol production by the Shell Oil Company in 1947. The reaction is carried out in the presence of high pressure steam at where a 5:3 ethylene to steam ratio is maintained. This process was used on an industrial scale by Union Carbide Corporation and others. It is no longer practiced in the US as fermentation ethanol produced from corn is more economical.

In an older process, first practiced on the industrial scale in 1930 by Union Carbide but now almost entirely obsolete, ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate, which was hydrolyzed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid:
:

=== Fermentation ===

Ethanol in alcoholic beverages and fuel is produced by fermentation. Certain species of yeast (e.g., &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) metabolize sugar (namely polysaccharides), producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equations below summarize the conversion:


Fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol. This process is carried out at around . Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing; higher concentrations, therefore, are obtained by fortification or distillation. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18% ethanol by volume.

To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereals, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In brewing beer, this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme amylase. When the malted grain is mashed, the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.

Sugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as corncobs, straw, and sawdust, into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugarcane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be fermentable sugar sources.

=== Testing ===

Breweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the C−H band at 2900 cm. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid-state sensor that compares the C−H band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the Beer–Lambert law. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a hydrometer, the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.

== Purification ==
Ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of , and &quot;cannot&quot; be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or heptane, allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.

Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by addition of a desiccant, such as molecular sieves, cellulose, or cornmeal. The desiccants can be dried and reused. Molecular sieves can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. Molecular sieves of pore-size 3 Ångstrom, a type of zeolite, effectively sequester water molecules while excluding ethanol molecules. Heating the wet sieves drives out the water, allowing regeneration of their desiccant capability.

Membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as the first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.

A variety of other techniques have been discussed, including the following:
* Salting using potassium carbonate to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water. This offers a very small potassium carbonate impurity to the alcohol that can be removed by distillation. This method is very useful in purification of ethanol by distillation, as ethanol forms an azeotrope with water.
* Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol under ambient conditions using copper nanoparticles on a carbon nanospike film as the catalyst;
* Extraction of ethanol from grain mash by supercritical carbon dioxide;
* Pervaporation;
* Fractional freezing is also used to concentrate fermented alcoholic solutions, such as traditionally made Applejack (beverage);
* Pressure swing adsorption.

=== Grades of ethanol ===

Pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol, naphtha, and pyridine. Products of this kind are called &quot;denatured alcohol.&quot;

Absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm). If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the US, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system. Rectified spirit, an azeotropic composition of 96% ethanol containing 4% water, is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Spirits of wine are about 94% ethanol (188 proof). The impurities are different from those in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.

== Reactions ==

Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon that its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group.

=== Ester formation ===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids to produce ethyl esters and water:
:RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O
This reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. Diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively. Diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis. Ethyl nitrite, prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a diuretic.

=== Dehydration ===
In the presence of acid catalysts, alcohols can be converted to alkenes such as ethanol to ethylene. Typically solid acids such as alumina are used.
:CH3CH2OH → H2C=CH2 + H2O

Since water is removed from the same molecule, the reaction is known as intramolecular dehydration. Intramolecular dehydration of an alcohol requires a high temperature and the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid. Ethylene produced from sugar-derived ethanol (primarily in Brazil) competes with ethylene produced from petrochemical feedstocks such as naphtha and ethane. At a lower temperature than that of intramolecular dehydration, intermolecular alcohol dehydration may occur producing a symmetrical ether. This is a condensation reaction. In the following example, diethyl ether is produced from ethanol:
:2 CH3CH2OH → CH3CH2OCH2CH3 + H2O

=== Combustion ===
Complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water:
:C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l); −Δc&quot;H&quot; = 1371 kJ/mol = 29.8 kJ/g = 327 kcal/mol = 7.1 kcal/g

:C2H5OH (l) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (g); −Δc&quot;H&quot; = 1236 kJ/mol = 26.8 kJ/g = 295.4 kcal/mol = 6.41 kcal/g

Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg·K)

=== Acid-base chemistry ===
Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the pH of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base, the ethoxide ion (CH3CH2O−), by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium:
:2 CH3CH2OH + 2 Na → 2 CH3CH2ONa + H2
or a very strong base such as sodium hydride:
:CH3CH2OH + NaH → CH3CH2ONa + H2
The acidities of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their pKa of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced:
:CH3CH2OH + NaOH CH3CH2ONa + H2O

=== Halogenation ===
Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an SN2 reaction:
:CH3CH2OH + HCl → CH3CH2Cl + H2O
HCl requires a catalyst such as zinc chloride.
HBr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst. Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents, such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide.
:CH3CH2OH + SOCl2 → CH3CH2Cl + SO2 + HCl

Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding haloform (CHX3, where X = Cl, Br, I). This conversion is called the haloform reaction.
An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral, which forms chloral hydrate upon reaction with water:
:4 Cl2 + CH3CH2OH → CCl3CHO + 5 HCl
:CCl3CHO + H2O → CCl3C(OH)2H

=== Oxidation ===
Ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid, depending on the reagents and conditions. This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver ADH. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to acetyl CoA, where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.

=== Metabolism ===
Ethanol is similar to macronutrients such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in that it provides calories. When consumed and metabolized, it contributes 7 kilocalories per gram via ethanol metabolism.

== Safety ==

Ethanol is very flammable and should not be used around an open flame.

Pure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes. Nausea, vomiting, and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion. Long-term use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage. Atmospheric concentrations above one part per thousand are above the European Union occupational exposure limits.

== History ==
The fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest biotechnologies employed by humans. Ethanol has historically been identified variously as spirit of wine or ardent spirits, and as aqua vitae or aqua vita. The intoxicating effects of its consumption have been known since ancient times. Ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverages. Dried residue on 9,000-year-old pottery found in China suggests that Neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages.

The inflammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE), Theophrastus (–287 BCE), and Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE). However, this did not immediately lead to the isolation of ethanol, despite the development of more advanced distillation techniques in second- and third-century Roman Egypt. An important recognition, first found in one of the writings attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (ninth century CE), was that by adding salt to boiling wine, which increases the wine&#x27;s relative volatility, the flammability of the resulting vapors may be enhanced. The distillation of wine is attested in Arabic works attributed to al-Kindī (–873 CE) and to al-Fārābī (–950), and in the 28th book of al-Zahrāwī&#x27;s (Latin: Abulcasis, 936–1013) &quot;Kitāb al-Taṣrīf&quot; (later translated into Latin as &quot;Liber servatoris&quot;). In the twelfth century, recipes for the production of &quot;aqua ardens&quot; (&quot;burning water&quot;, i.e., ethanol) by distilling wine with salt started to appear in a number of Latin works, and by the end of the thirteenth century it had become a widely known substance among Western European chemists.

The works of Taddeo Alderotti (1223–1296) describe a method for concentrating ethanol involving repeated fractional distillation through a water-cooled still, by which an ethanol purity of 90% could be obtained. The medicinal properties of ethanol were studied by Arnald of Villanova (1240–1311 CE) and John of Rupescissa (–1366), the latter of whom regarded it as a life-preserving substance able to prevent all diseases (the &quot;aqua vitae&quot; or &quot;water of life&quot;, also called by John the &quot;quintessence&quot; of wine). In China, archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the Jin (1115–1234) or Southern Song (1127–1279) dynasties. A still has been found at an archaeological site in Qinglong, Hebei, dating to the 12th century. In India, the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the Middle East, and was in wide use in the Delhi Sultanate by the 14th century.

In 1796, German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol (the alcohol-water azeotrope) with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and in 1807 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure determined ethanol&#x27;s chemical formula. Fifty years later, Archibald Scott Couper published the structural formula of ethanol, one of the first structural formulas determined.

Ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by Michael Faraday. He found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas. He gave the resulting solution to Henry Hennell, a British chemist, who found in 1826 that it contained &quot;sulphovinic acid&quot; (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). In 1828, Hennell and the French chemist Georges-Simon Serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol. Thus, in 1825 Faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene (a component of coal gas) by acid-catalyzed hydration, a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis.

Ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the U.S. as early as 1840, but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the Civil War made this use uneconomical. The tax was repealed in 1906. Use as an automotive fuel dates back to 1908, with the Ford Model T able to run on petrol (gasoline) or ethanol. It fuels some spirit lamps.

Ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene. Ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. In chemistry, it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products. It has a long history as a fuel for heat and light, and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engines.

<doc id="10049" wikidata="Q48187" url="?curid=10049" title="Eric Clapton">
<text>Eric Patrick Clapton (born 1945) is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most successful and influential guitarists in rock music. He ranked second in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and fourth in Gibson″s &quot;Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&quot;. He was named number five in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players&quot; in 2009.

After playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds from 1963 to 1965, and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers from 1965 to 1966. After leaving Mayall, he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist/vocalist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and &quot;arty, blues-based psychedelic pop&quot;. After four successful albums, Cream broke up in November 1968. Clapton then formed the blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up. Clapton then toured with Delaney &amp; Bonnie and recorded his first solo album in 1970, before forming Derek and the Dominos with Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. Like Blind Faith, the band only lasted one album, &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;, which includes &quot;Layla&quot;, one of Clapton&#x27;s signature songs.

Clapton continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; (which helped reggae reach a mass market), the country-infused &quot;Slowhand&quot; album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986&#x27;s &quot;August&quot;. Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton&#x27;s grief was expressed in the song &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;, which appeared on his &quot;Unplugged&quot; album. In 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&amp;B crossover &quot;Change the World&quot;. In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His latest studio album, &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, was released in 2024.

Clapton has received 18 Grammy Awards as well as the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2004, he was awarded a CBE for services to music. He has received four Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream. In his solo career, he has sold 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for those recovering from substance abuse.

==Early life==
Clapton was born on 30 March 1945 in Ripley, Surrey, England, to 16-year-old Patricia Molly Clapton (1929–1999) and Edward Walter Fryer (1920–1985), a 25-year-old soldier from Montreal, Quebec. Fryer was drafted to war before Clapton&#x27;s birth and then returned to Canada. Clapton grew up believing that his grandmother, Rose, and her second husband, Jack Clapp, Patricia&#x27;s stepfather, were his parents, and that his mother was actually his older sister. The similarity in surnames gave rise to the erroneous belief that Clapton&#x27;s real surname is Clapp (Reginald Cecil Clapton was the name of Rose&#x27;s first husband, Eric Clapton&#x27;s maternal grandfather). Years later, his mother married another Canadian soldier and moved to Germany, leaving Eric with his grandparents in Surrey.

Clapton received an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument was difficult to play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later he picked it up again and started playing consistently. He was influenced by blues music from an early age, and practised long hours learning the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to them over and over until he was satisfied.

In 1961, after leaving Hollyfield School in Surbiton, he studied at the Kingston College of Art but was expelled at the end of the academic year because his focus had remained on music rather than art. His guitar playing was sufficiently advanced that, by the age of 16, he was getting noticed. Around this time, he began busking around Kingston, Richmond, and the West End.
In 1962, he started performing as a duo with fellow blues enthusiast Dave Brock in pubs around Surrey. When he was 17, he joined his first band, an early British R&amp;B group, the Roosters, whose other guitarist was Tom McGuinness. He stayed with them from January until August 1963. In October of that year, he performed a seven-gig stint with Casey Jones and the Engineers.

== Career ==
=== The Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers ===
In October 1963, Clapton joined the Yardbirds, a rhythm and blues band, and stayed with them until March 1965. Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B. King, Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene. The band initially played Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones&#x27; residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London. They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.

Yardbirds&#x27; rhythm guitarist, Chris Dreja, recalled that whenever Clapton broke a guitar string during a concert, he would stay on stage and replace it. The English audiences would wait out the delay by doing what is called a &quot;slow handclap&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Slowhand&quot; came from Giorgio Gomelsky, a pun on the slow handclapping that ensued when Clapton stopped playing while he replaced a string. In December 1964, Clapton made his first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with the Yardbirds. Since then, Clapton has performed at the Hall over 200 times, and has stated that performing at the venue is like &quot;playing in my front room&quot;.

In March 1965, Clapton and the Yardbirds had their first major hit, &quot;For Your Love&quot;, written by songwriter Graham Gouldman, who also wrote hit songs for Herman&#x27;s Hermits and the Hollies (and later achieved success of his own as a member of 10cc). In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-orientated sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that &quot;For Your Love&quot; went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member. Clapton suggested fellow guitarist Jimmy Page as his replacement, but Page declined out of loyalty to Clapton, putting Jeff Beck forward. Beck and Page played together in the Yardbirds for a while, but Beck, Page, and Clapton were never in the group together. They first appeared together in 1983 on the 12-date benefit tour for Action for Research into multiple sclerosis with the first date on 23 September at the Royal Albert Hall.

Clapton joined John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers in April 1965, only to quit a few months later. In June, Clapton was invited to jam with Jimmy Page, recording a number of tracks that were retroactively credited to The Immediate All-Stars. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. After a car crash that killed the bassist and injured the guitarist of the Greek band the Juniors, on 17 October 1965 the surviving members played memorial shows in which Clapton played with the band. In October 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a side project with Jack Bruce and Steve Winwood among others, recording only a few tracks under the name Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained fame for playing on the influential album, &quot;Blues Breakers – John Mayall – With Eric Clapton&quot;, this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time in July 1966. The album itself is often called &quot;The Beano Album&quot; by fans because of its cover photograph showing Clapton reading the British children&#x27;s comic &quot;The Beano&quot;.

Having swapped his Fender Telecaster and Vox AC30 amplifier for a 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar and Marshall amplifier, Clapton&#x27;s sound and playing inspired the famous slogan &quot;Clapton is God&quot;, spray-painted by an unknown admirer on a wall in Islington, North London in 1967. The graffito was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall. Clapton is reported to have been embarrassed by the slogan, saying in his &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; profile in 1987, &quot;I never accepted that I was the greatest guitar player in the world. I always &quot;wanted&quot; to be the greatest guitar player in the world, but that&#x27;s an ideal, and I accept it as an ideal&quot;.

===Cream===
Clapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 (replaced by Peter Green) and was invited by drummer Ginger Baker to play in his newly formed band Cream, one of the earliest supergroups, with Jack Bruce on bass (Bruce was previously of the Bluesbreakers, the Graham Bond Organisation and Manfred Mann). Before the formation of Cream, Clapton was not well known in the United States; he left the Yardbirds before &quot;For Your Love&quot; hit the US top ten, and had yet to perform there. During his time with Cream, Clapton began to develop as a singer, songwriter and guitarist, though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist Pete Brown. Cream&#x27;s first gig was an unofficial performance at the Twisted Wheel Club in Manchester on 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor. Cream established its enduring legend with the high-volume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.

By early 1967, fans of the emerging blues-rock sound in the UK had begun to portray Clapton as Britain&#x27;s top guitarist; however, he found himself rivalled by the emergence of Jimi Hendrix, an acid rock-infused guitarist who used wailing feedback and effects pedals to create new sounds for the instrument. Hendrix attended a performance of the newly formed Cream at the Central London Polytechnic on 1966, during which he sat in on a double-timed version of &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. Top UK stars, including Clapton, Pete Townshend and members of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, avidly attended Hendrix&#x27;s early club performances. Hendrix&#x27;s arrival had an immediate and major effect on the next phase of Clapton&#x27;s career.

Clapton first visited the United States while touring with Cream. In March 1967, Cream performed a nine-show stand at the RKO Theater in New York. Clapton&#x27;s 1964 painted Gibson SG guitar – The Fool – a &quot;psychedelic fantasy&quot;, according to Clapton, made its debut at the RKO Theater. Clapton used the guitar for most of Cream&#x27;s recordings after &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;, particularly on &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, until the band broke up in 1968. One of the world&#x27;s best-known guitars, it symbolises the psychedelic era. They recorded &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; in New York from 11 to 15 May 1967. Cream&#x27;s repertoire varied from hard rock (&quot;I Feel Free&quot;) to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (&quot;Spoonful&quot;). &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; contained Clapton&#x27;s searing guitar lines, Bruce&#x27;s soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker&#x27;s powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream&#x27;s talents secured them as an influential power trio. Clapton&#x27;s voice can be heard on Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot;, on the tracks &quot;Are You Hung Up?&quot; and &quot;Nasal Retentive Calliope Music&quot;.

In 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist&#x27;s role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (No. 5, 1968), &quot;White Room&quot; (No. 6, 1968) and &quot;Crossroads&quot; (No. 28, 1969) – a live version of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;. Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the supergroup was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream&#x27;s demise. A strongly critical &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of a concert of the group&#x27;s second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio&#x27;s demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly. Clapton has also credited &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, the debut album of The Band, and its revolutionary Americana sound as influencing his decision to leave Cream.

Cream&#x27;s farewell album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, comprising live performances recorded at The Forum, Los Angeles, on 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded. It also spawned the studio single &quot;Badge&quot;, co-written by Clapton and George Harrison (Clapton had met and become close friends with Harrison after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the London Palladium). In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison&#x27;s &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, from the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). Harrison&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison&#x27;s albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as &quot;L&#x27;Angelo Misterioso&quot; for his contributions to the song &quot;Badge&quot; on &quot;Goodbye&quot;. The pair often played live together as each other&#x27;s guest. A year after Harrison&#x27;s death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the Concert for George.

In January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became &quot;Let It Be&quot;, tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting John Lennon to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return. Michael Lindsay-Hogg, television director of the recording sessions for &quot;Let It Be&quot;, later recalled: &quot;I was there when John mentioned Clapton – but that wasn&#x27;t going to happen. Would Eric have become a Beatle? No. Paul [McCartney] didn&#x27;t want to go there. He didn&#x27;t want them to break up. Then George came back.&quot; Clapton was on good terms with all four of the Beatles; in December 1968 he had played with Lennon at &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; as part of the one-off group the Dirty Mac.

Cream briefly reunited in 1993 to perform at the ceremony inducting them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A full reunion took place in May 2005, with Clapton, Bruce and Baker playing four sold-out concerts at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, and three shows at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden that October. Recordings from the London shows, &quot;Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005&quot;, were released on CD, LP and DVD in late 2005.

===Blind Faith===
Clapton&#x27;s next group, Blind Faith, formed in 1969, was composed of Cream drummer Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Ric Grech of Family, and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour. The supergroup debuted before 100,000 fans in London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 1969. They performed several dates in Scandinavia and began a sold-out American tour in July before their only album was released. The LP &quot;Blind Faith&quot; consisted of just six songs, one of them the hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot;. Another, &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot;, is the first song credited solely to Clapton. The album&#x27;s jacket image of a topless pubescent girl was deemed controversial in the US and was replaced by a photograph of the band. Blind Faith dissolved after less than seven months.

===Delaney &amp; Bonnie and first solo album===

Clapton subsequently toured as a sideman for an act that had opened for Blind Faith, Delaney and Bonnie and Friends. He also performed as a member of Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in September 1969, a recording from which was released as the album &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;. On 30 September, Clapton played lead guitar on Lennon&#x27;s second solo single, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;. On 15 December that year, Clapton performed with Lennon, Harrison and others as the Plastic Ono Supergroup at a fundraiser for UNICEF in London.

Delaney Bramlett encouraged Clapton in his singing and writing. Using the Bramletts&#x27; backing group and an all-star cast of session players (including Leon Russell and Stephen Stills), Clapton recorded his first solo album during two brief tour hiatuses, titled &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;. Delaney Bramlett co-wrote six of the songs with Clapton, also producing the LP, and Bonnie Bramlett co-wrote &quot;Let It Rain&quot;. The album yielded the unexpected US No. 18 hit, J. J. Cale&#x27;s &quot;After Midnight&quot;. Clapton also worked with much of Delaney and Bonnie&#x27;s band to record George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; in spring 1970.

During this period, Clapton also recorded with artists such as Dr. John, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr and Dave Mason. With Chicago blues artist Howlin&#x27; Wolf, he recorded &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot;, that also included long-time Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin and members of the Rolling Stones, Winwood and Starr. Despite the superstar line-up, critic Cub Koda noted: &quot;Even Eric Clapton, who usually welcomes any chance to play with one of his idols, has criticized this album repeatedly in interviews, which speaks volumes in and of itself.&quot; Other noted recordings from this period include Clapton&#x27;s guitar work on &quot;Go Back Home&quot; from Stephen Stills&#x27; self-titled first solo album.

===Derek and the Dominos===
With the intention of counteracting the &quot;star&quot; cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie&#x27;s former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble. During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their 1968 album &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, saying: &quot;What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity – or &quot;pseudo&quot;-virtuosity – thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song.&quot;
The band was originally called &quot;Eric Clapton and Friends&quot;. The eventual name was a fluke that occurred when the band&#x27;s provisional name of &quot;Del and the Dynamos&quot; was misread as Derek and the Dominos. Clapton&#x27;s biography states that Tony Ashton of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke told Clapton to call the band &quot;Del and the Dominos&quot;, since &quot;Del&quot; was his nickname for Eric Clapton. Del and Eric were combined and the final name became &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot;.

Clapton&#x27;s close friendship with George Harrison brought him into contact with Harrison&#x27;s wife, Pattie Boyd, with whom he became deeply infatuated. When she spurned his advances, Clapton&#x27;s unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos&#x27; album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman&#x27;s slide guitar as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at Criteria Studios in Miami with Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd, who had worked with Clapton on Cream&#x27;s &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, the band recorded a double album.

The album contained the hit love song &quot;Layla&quot;, inspired by the classical poet of Persian literature, Nizami Ganjavi&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Layla and Majnun&quot;, a copy of which Ian Dallas had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her. The two parts of &quot;Layla&quot; were recorded in separate sessions: the opening guitar section was recorded first, and for the second section, laid down a few weeks later, drummer Jim Gordon played the piano part for the melody, which he claimed to have written (though Bobby Whitlock stated that Rita Coolidge wrote it).

The &quot;Layla&quot; LP was actually recorded by a five-piece version of the group, thanks to the unforeseen inclusion of guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band. A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd – who was also producing the Allmans – invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot;. In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded &quot;Key to the Highway&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; (a blues standard popularised by Freddie King and others) and &quot;Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?&quot; In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded &quot;I Looked Away&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and &quot;Keep on Growing&quot;. Allman returned to record &quot;I Am Yours&quot;, &quot;Anyday&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;. On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot; and the title track. The following day, the final track, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, was recorded.
Tragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of &quot;Little Wing&quot; as a tribute. On 1970, one day before Hendrix&#x27;s death, Clapton had purchased a left-handed Fender Stratocaster that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton&#x27;s woes, &quot;Layla&quot; received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton&#x27;s later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album &quot;In Concert&quot;.

Recording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the &quot;Layla&quot; sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the &quot;musical brother I&#x27;d never had but wished I did&quot;. Although Radle remained Clapton&#x27;s bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock&#x27;s appearance on the &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; show. Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer Jim Gordon, who had undiagnosed schizophrenia and years later murdered his mother during a psychotic episode. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remained for the rest of his life.

===Personal problems and early solo success===
Clapton&#x27;s career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction. Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up. He nursed a heroin addiction, which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance. In January 1973, the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre, titled the &quot;Rainbow Concert&quot;, to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton returned the favour by playing &quot;The Preacher&quot; in Ken Russell&#x27;s film version of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; in 1975. His appearance in the film (performing &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;) is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set.
In 1974, Clapton started living with Boyd (they would not marry until 1979) and was no longer using heroin (although he gradually began to drink heavily). He assembled a low-key touring band that included Radle, Miami guitarist George Terry, keyboardist Dick Sims (who died in 2011), drummer Jamie Oldaker, and vocalists Yvonne Elliman and Marcy Levy (also known as Marcella Detroit). With this band Clapton recorded &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; was Clapton&#x27;s first number one hit. The 1975 album &quot;There&#x27;s One in Every Crowd&quot; continued this trend. The album&#x27;s original title, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Guitar Player (There&#x27;s One in Every Crowd)&quot;, was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP &quot;E. C. Was Here&quot;. Clapton continued to release albums and toured regularly. Highlights of the period include &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; (a collaboration with Bob Dylan and The Band); &quot;Slowhand&quot;, which contained &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; and a second J. J. Cale cover, &quot;Cocaine&quot;. In 1976, he performed as one of a string of notable guests at the farewell performance of The Band, filmed in a Martin Scorsese documentary titled &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

===Continued success===

In 1981, Clapton was invited by producer Martin Lewis to appear at the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball in London. Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets – reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at London&#x27;s Drury Lane theatre heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade. Many factors had influenced Clapton&#x27;s comeback, including his &quot;deepening commitment to Christianity&quot;, to which he had converted prior to his heroin addiction.

After calling his manager and admitting he was an alcoholic, Clapton flew to Minneapolis–Saint Paul in January 1982 and checked in at Hazelden Treatment Center, located in Center City, Minnesota. On the flight over, Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks, for fear he would never be able to drink again. Clapton wrote in his autobiography:

After being discharged, it was recommended by doctors of Hazelden that Clapton not partake in any activities that would act as triggers for his alcoholism or stress. Nonetheless, Clapton would go back to the Hazelden Treatment Center in November 1987. He has stayed sober ever since. A few months after his discharge from his first rehab, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors&#x27; orders. Working with Tom Dowd, he produced what he thought as his &quot;most forced&quot; album to date, &quot;Money and Cigarettes&quot;. Clapton chose the name of the album &quot;because that&#x27;s all I saw myself having left&quot; after his first rehabilitation from alcoholism.

In 1984, he performed on former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters&#x27; solo album &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;, and participated in the supporting tour. Since then Waters and Clapton have had a close relationship. In 2005, they performed together for the Tsunami Relief Fund. In 2006, they performed at the Highclere Castle in aid of the Countryside Alliance and played two set pieces of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Clapton, now a regular charity performer, played at the Live Aid concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia on 13 July 1985, playing with Phil Collins, Tim Renwick, Chris Stainton, Jamie Oldaker, Marcy Levy, Shaun Murphy and Donald &#x27;Duck&#x27; Dunn. When offered a slot close to peak viewing hours, he was apparently flattered. His album output continued in the 1980s, including two produced with Phil Collins, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, which produced the hits &quot;Forever Man&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Waiting&quot;, and 1986&#x27;s &quot;August&quot;.

&quot;August&quot; was suffused with Collins&#x27;s trademark drum and horn sound, and became Clapton&#x27;s biggest seller in the UK to date, matching his highest chart position, number 3. The album&#x27;s first track, the hit &quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot;, appeared in the Tom Cruise–Paul Newman film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. The songs &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot; (with Tina Turner) and &quot;Miss You&quot; continued Clapton&#x27;s more angry sound. This rebound kicked off Clapton&#x27;s two-year period of touring with Collins and their &quot;August&quot; collaborators, bassist Nathan East and keyboard player/songwriter Greg Phillinganes. While on tour for &quot;August&quot;, two concert videos were recorded of the four-man band: &quot;Eric Clapton Live from Montreux&quot; and &quot;Eric Clapton and Friends&quot;. Clapton later remade &quot;After Midnight&quot; as a single and a promotional track for the Michelob beer brand, which had also used earlier songs by Collins and Steve Winwood. Clapton won a British Academy Television Award for his collaboration with Michael Kamen on the score for the 1985 BBC television thriller series &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. At the 1987 Brit Awards in London, Clapton was awarded the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 1987, he played on George Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, contributing guitar to &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s What It Takes&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Radio&quot; and &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;.

Clapton also got together with the Bee Gees for charity. The supergroup called itself the Bunburys, and recorded a charity album with the proceeds going to the Bunbury Cricket Club in Cheshire, which plays exhibition cricket matches to raise money for nonprofit organisations in England. The Bunburys recorded three songs for &quot;The Bunbury Tails&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;re the Bunburys&quot;, &quot;Bunbury Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Fight (No Matter How Long)&quot;. The last song also appeared on &quot;The 1988 Summer Olympics Album&quot; and went to No. 8 on the rock music chart. Clapton played at the cricket club&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations in 2011, which were held at London&#x27;s Grosvenor House Hotel. In 1988, he played with Dire Straits and Elton John at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium and the Prince&#x27;s Trust rock gala at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1989, Clapton released &quot;Journeyman&quot;, an album that covered a wide range of styles, including blues, jazz, soul and pop. Collaborators included George Harrison, Phil Collins, Daryl Hall, Chaka Khan, Mick Jones, David Sanborn and Robert Cray. The song &quot;Bad Love&quot; was released as a single and later won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance.

===Son&#x27;s death, &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;===
The 1990s brought a series of 32 concerts to the Royal Albert Hall, such as the 24 Nights series of concerts that took place around January through February 1990, and February to March 1991. On 1990, Dire Straits, Clapton and Elton John made a guest appearance in the Nordoff-Robbins charity show held at Knebworth in England. On 1990, fellow blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who was touring with Clapton, and three members of their road crew were killed in a helicopter crash between concerts. Then, on 1991, Clapton&#x27;s four-year-old son, Conor, died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of his mother&#x27;s friend&#x27;s New York City apartment at 117 East 57th Street. Clapton was informed of his son&#x27;s death through a hysterical phone call by the boy&#x27;s mother Lory Del Santo. Once comprehending what had happened he described feeling like he &quot;went off the edge of the world&quot; and ran to the scene. The first person to offer condolences towards Clapton was friend and fellow guitarist Keith Richards, who himself had lost his young son Tara in 1976. Conor&#x27;s funeral took place on 28 March at St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church in Clapton&#x27;s home village in Ripley, Surrey, with Conor buried in the church graveyard. After his son&#x27;s death Clapton began attending AA meetings. In 1991, Clapton appeared on Richie Sambora&#x27;s album, &quot;Stranger in This Town&quot;, in a song dedicated to him, called &quot;Mr. Bluesman&quot;. He contributed guitar and vocals to &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, a duet with Elton John on the latter&#x27;s &quot;The One&quot; album the following year.

Clapton&#x27;s grief was expressed in the song &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;, which was co-written by Will Jennings. At the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, Clapton received six Grammys for the single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and his &quot;Unplugged&quot; album, for which Clapton performed live in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, Berkshire, England. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and is certified Diamond by the RIAA for selling over 10 million copies in the US. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and is certified four times platinum in the UK. On 9 September 1992, Clapton performed &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, and won the award for Best Male Video.

In 1992, Clapton received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. In October 1992 Clapton was among the dozens of artists performing at Bob Dylan&#x27;s 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Recorded at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the live two-disk CD/DVD captured a show full of celebrities performing classic Dylan songs, with Clapton playing the lead on a nearly 7-minute version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; as part of the finale. While Clapton played acoustic guitar on &quot;Unplugged&quot;, his 1994 album &quot;From the Cradle&quot; contained new versions of old blues standards, highlighted by his electric guitar playing. In 1995, Clapton for the first and only time appeared on a UK No. 1 single, collaborating with Cher, Chrissie Hynde, and Neneh Cherry on a solo to a cover of &quot;Love Can Build a Bridge&quot; released in aid of the British charity telethon Comic Relief.

On 12 September 1996 Clapton played a party for Armani at New York City&#x27;s Lexington Armory with Greg Phillinganes, Nathan East and Steve Gadd. Sheryl Crow appeared on one number, performing &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot;, a track from &quot;August&quot;, which was first performed by Tina Turner during the Prince&#x27;s Trust All-Star Rock show in 1986. It was Clapton&#x27;s sole US appearance that year, following the open-air concert held at Hyde Park. The concert was taped and the footage was released both on VHS video cassette and later, on DVD. 
Clapton&#x27;s 1996 recording of the Wayne Kirkpatrick/Gordon Kennedy/Tommy Sims tune &quot;Change the World&quot; (on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Phenomenon&quot;) won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1997, the same year he recorded &quot;Retail Therapy&quot; (an album of electronic music with Simon Climie under the pseudonym TDF). On 15 September 1997, Clapton appeared at the &quot;Music for Montserrat&quot; concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;Same Old Blues&quot; before finishing with &quot;Hey Jude&quot; alongside fellow English artists Paul McCartney, Elton John, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler and Sting. That autumn, Clapton released the album &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, the first record containing new material for almost a decade.

In 1996, Clapton had a relationship with singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow. They remain friends, and Clapton appeared as a guest on Crow&#x27;s Central Park Concert. The duo performed a Cream hit single, &quot;White Room&quot;. Later, Clapton and Crow performed an alternate version of &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; with other guitar legends at the Crossroads Guitar Festival in June 2007 as well as Robert Johnson&#x27;s blues classic &quot;Crossroads&quot; at London&#x27;s Hyde Park in August 2008 with John Mayer and Robert Randolph.

At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards on 24 February 1999, Clapton received his third Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for his song &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. In October 1999, the compilation album, &quot;Clapton Chronicles: The Best of Eric Clapton&quot;, was released, which contained a new song, &quot;Blue Eyes Blue&quot;, that also appears in soundtrack for the film, &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. Clapton finished the twentieth century with collaborations with Carlos Santana and B.B. King. Clapton looked up to King and had always wanted to make an album with him, while King said of Clapton, &quot;I admire the man. I think he&#x27;s No. 1 in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as a guitarist and No. 1 as a great person.&quot;

===Collaboration albums===

Clapton released the album &quot;Reptile&quot; in March 2001. One month after the 11 September attacks, Clapton appeared at the Concert for New York City, performing alongside Buddy Guy. An event marking the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in June 2002, Clapton performed &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. On 29 November 2002, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall, a tribute to George Harrison, who had died a year earlier of lung cancer. Clapton was a performer and the musical director. The concert included Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Ravi Shankar, Gary Brooker, Billy Preston, Joe Brown and Dhani Harrison. In 2004, Clapton released two albums of covers of songs by bluesman Robert Johnson, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; and &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot;. Guitarist Doyle Bramhall II worked on the album with Clapton (after opening Clapton&#x27;s 2001 tour with his band Smokestack) and joined him on his 2004 tour. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Clapton No. 53 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Other media appearances include the Toots &amp; the Maytals Grammy award-winning album &quot;True Love&quot;, where he played guitar on the track &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;.
On 22 January 2005, Clapton performed in the Tsunami Relief Concert held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, in aid of the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In May 2005, Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker reunited as Cream for a series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Concert recordings were released on CD and DVD. Later, Cream performed in New York at Madison Square Garden. Clapton&#x27;s first album of new original material in nearly five years, &quot;Back Home&quot;, was released on Reprise Records on .

A collaboration with guitarist J. J. Cale, &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;, was released on 2006, featuring Derek Trucks and Billy Preston (Preston had also been a part of Clapton&#x27;s 2004 touring band). He invited Trucks to join his band for his 2006–2007 world tour. Bramhall remained, giving Clapton three elite guitarists in his band, allowing him to revisit many Derek and the Dominos songs that he hadn&#x27;t played in decades. Trucks became the third member of the Allman Brothers Band to tour supporting Clapton, the second being pianist/keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who appeared on the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album and the &quot;24 Nights&quot; performances at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 1990 and 1991, as well as Clapton&#x27;s 1992 US tour.

On 20 May 2006, Clapton performed with Queen drummer Roger Taylor and former Pink Floyd bassist/songwriter Roger Waters at Highclere Castle, Hampshire, in support of the Countryside Alliance, which promotes issues relating to the British countryside. On 2006, Clapton made a guest appearance at the Bob Dylan concert in Columbus, Ohio, playing guitar on three songs in Jimmie Vaughan&#x27;s opening act. The chemistry between Trucks and Clapton convinced him to invite the Derek Trucks Band to open for Clapton&#x27;s set at his 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival. Trucks remained on set and performed with Clapton&#x27;s band throughout his performances. The rights to Clapton&#x27;s official memoirs, written by Christopher Simon Sykes and published in 2007, were sold at the 2005 Frankfurt Book Fair for .
In 2007, Clapton learned more about his father, a Canadian soldier who left the UK after the war. Although Clapton&#x27;s grandparents eventually told him the truth about his parentage, he only knew that his father&#x27;s name was Edward Fryer. This was a source of disquiet for Clapton, as witnessed by his 1998 song &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. A Montreal journalist named Michael Woloschuk researched Canadian Armed Forces service records and tracked down members of Fryer&#x27;s family, and finally pieced together the story. He learned that Clapton&#x27;s father was Edward Walter Fryer, born 1920, in Montreal and died in Newmarket, Ontario. Fryer was a musician (piano and saxophone) and a lifelong drifter who was married several times, had several children, and apparently never knew that he was the father of Eric Clapton. Clapton thanked Woloschuk in an encounter at Macdonald–Cartier Airport, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

On 26 February 2008, it was reported that Clapton had been invited to play a concert in North Korea by government officials. Clapton agreed in principle and suggested it take place in 2009. Kristen Foster, a spokesperson for Clapton, said that he regularly received offers to play abroad and that there had been no agreement for him to play in North Korea. In February 2008, Clapton performed with his long-time friend Steve Winwood at Madison Square Garden and guested on his recorded single, &quot;Dirty City&quot;, on Winwood&#x27;s album &quot;Nine Lives&quot;. The two former Blind Faith bandmates met again for a series of 14 concerts throughout the United States in June 2009. Clapton&#x27;s 2008 Summer Tour began on at the Ford Amphitheatre, Tampa, Florida, and then moved to Canada, Ireland, England, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Monaco. On 2008, he headlined Saturday night for Hard Rock Calling 2008 in London&#x27;s Hyde Park (previously Hyde Park Calling) with support from Sheryl Crow and John Mayer.
In March 2009, the Allman Brothers Band (amongst many notable guests) celebrated their 40th year, dedicating their string of concerts to the late Duane Allman on their annual run at the Beacon Theatre. Eric Clapton was one of the performers, with drummer Butch Trucks remarking that the performance was not the typical Allman Brothers experience, given the number and musical styles of the guests who were invited to perform. Songs like &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; were punctuated with others, including &quot;The Weight&quot;, with Levon Helm; Johnny Winter sitting in on Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Red House&quot;; and &quot;Layla&quot;. On 2009 Clapton appeared at the Royal Albert Hall, playing &quot;Further on Up the Road&quot; with Joe Bonamassa.

Clapton was scheduled to perform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert in Madison Square Garden on 2009, but cancelled due to gallstone surgery. Van Morrison (who also cancelled) said in an interview that he and Clapton were to do a &quot;couple of songs&quot;, but that they would do something else together at &quot;some other stage of the game&quot;.

===&quot;Clapton&quot;, &quot;Old Sock&quot;, &quot;I Still Do&quot;, and &quot;Happy Xmas&quot;===
Clapton performed a two-night show with Jeff Beck at the O2 Arena in London on 2010. The two former Yardbirds extended their 2010 tour with stops at Madison Square Garden, the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, and the Bell Centre in Montreal. Clapton performed a series of concerts in 11 cities throughout the United States from to 2010, including Roger Daltrey as opening act. His third European tour with Steve Winwood began on and ended , including Tom Norris as opening act. He then began a short North American tour lasting from to , starting with his third Crossroads Guitar Festival on at Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Illinois. Clapton released a new studio album, &quot;Clapton&quot;, on 2010 in the United Kingdom and 28 September 2010 in the United States. On 2010, Clapton performed as guest on the Prince&#x27;s Trust rock gala held at the Royal Albert Hall, supported by the house band for the evening, which included Jools Holland, Midge Ure and Mark King.
On 24 June 2011, Clapton was in concert with Pino Daniele in Cava de&#x27; Tirreni stadium before performing a series of concerts in South America from 6 to 16 October 2011. He spent November and December 2011 touring Japan with Steve Winwood, playing 13 shows in various cities throughout the country. On 24 February 2012 Clapton, Keith Richards, Gary Clark Jr., Derek Trucks, Doyle Bramhall II, Kim Wilson and other artists performed together in the Howlin&#x27; For Hubert Tribute concert held at the Apollo Theater of New York City honouring blues guitarist Hubert Sumlin who died at age 80 on 4 December 2011. On 29 November 2012, Clapton joined the Rolling Stones at London&#x27;s O2 Arena during the band&#x27;s second of five arena dates celebrating their 50th anniversary. On 12 December, Clapton performed The Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden, broadcast live via television, radio, cinemas and the Internet across six continents. In January 2013, Surfdog Records announced a signed deal with Clapton for the release of his forthcoming album &quot;Old Sock&quot; on 12 March. On 8 April 2013, Eric and Hard Rock International launched the limited-edition Eric Clapton Artist Spotlight merchandise programme benefiting Crossroads Centre Antigua. Clapton toured the US and Europe from 14 March to 19 June 2013 to celebrate 50 years as a professional musician. On 28 February 2013, Clapton announced his intention to stop touring in 2015 due to hassles with travel.
On 15 October 2013, Clapton&#x27;s popular &quot;Unplugged&quot; album and concert DVD were re-released, titled &quot;Unplugged: Expanded &amp; Remastered.&quot; The album includes the original 14 tracks, remastered, as well as 6 additional tracks, including 2 versions of &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. The DVD includes a restored version of the concert, as well as over 60 minutes of unseen footage from the rehearsal. On 13 and 14 November 2013, Clapton headlined the final two evenings of the &quot;Baloise Session&quot;, an annual indoor music festival in Basel, Switzerland. On 20 November 2013, Warner Bros released Crossroads Guitar Festival 2013 in CD/DVD/Blu-ray. On 30 April 2014, Clapton announced the release of &quot;The Breeze: An Appreciation of JJ Cale&quot; as an homage to J. J. Cale who died on 26 July 2013. This tribute album is named after the 1972 single &quot;Call Me the Breeze&quot; and comprises 16 Cale songs performed by Clapton, Mark Knopfler, John Mayer, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty and others. On 21 June 2014, Clapton abruptly walked off stage during a concert at the Glasgow Hydro. Although he did return to perform one final song, thousands of fans were upset by the lack of explanation from Clapton or the venue and booed after the concert ended around 40 minutes before advertised to finish. Both Clapton and the venue apologised the next day, blaming &#x27;technical difficulties&#x27; for making sound conditions &#x27;unbearable&#x27; for Clapton on stage. A week later he confirmed his retirement plans attributing his decision to the road being &quot;unbearable&quot; in addition to &quot;odd ailments&quot; that may force him to put down his guitar permanently. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Clapton revealed that he had been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in 2013, a condition involving damage to peripheral nerves that typically causes stabbing, burning, or tingling pain in the arms and legs.
Clapton performed two shows at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 and 3 May 2015 followed by a 7-night residency at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall from 14 to 23 May 2015 to celebrate his 70th birthday on 30 March. The shows also mark 50 years since Clapton first played at the Royal Albert Hall – his debut was on 7 December 1964 when he performed as part of the Yardbirds for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Beat Show&quot;. The concert film, &quot;Slowhand at 70 – Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, was released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on 13 November 2015 on DVD, CD, Blu-ray and LP. The 2-night concerts in the US marked the 46th anniversary since Clapton, with Cream, opened the &quot;new&quot; Madison Square Garden on 2 November 1968. Clapton has performed more times at Madison Square Garden than any other US venue, a total of 45 times. On 20 May 2016, Clapton released his twenty-third studio album &quot;I Still Do&quot;. On 30 September 2016 the live-album &quot;Live in San Diego&quot; was released. In August 2018, Clapton announced that he had recorded his twenty-fourth studio album, &quot;Happy Xmas&quot;, which consists of blues-tinged interpretations of Christmas songs, with the album released on 12 October. Between April and September 2019, he played 17 concerts in Japan, Europe and the Southwestern United States. He returned to the road in September 2021, playing eight shows in the southern United States. In May 2022, Clapton announced a run of seven US concerts in September with Jimmie Vaughan. In May 2023, Clapton performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall, sharing the stage with Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Kirk Hammett and Johnny Depp among others. In 2024, Clapton contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

===&quot;Meanwhile&quot;===

In May 2024, Clapton revealed in an interview with &quot;The Real Music Observer&quot; that he was working on a new studio album, titled &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, with the hopes of releasing it in the fall of that year.

==Influences==

Clapton cites Muddy Waters, Freddie King, B.B. King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, and Hubert Sumlin as guitar-playing influences. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton refers to Muddy Waters as &quot;the father figure I never really had&quot;. Until his death in 1983, Waters was a part of Clapton&#x27;s life. &quot;When I got to know Muddy, unfortunately, my drinking career was in full sway.&quot; In 2000, Clapton collaborated with B.B. King on their album &quot;Riding with the King&quot;. The music video for the title track shows Clapton as the chauffeur, with one of his idols in the back seat.

Clapton has said that blues musician Robert Johnson is his single most important influence. In 2004, Clapton released &quot;Sessions for Robert Johnson&quot;, containing covers of Johnson&#x27;s songs using electric and acoustic guitars. In an essay for the 1990 boxed set of Johnson&#x27;s recordings, Clapton wrote:
Clapton also singled out Buddy Holly as an influence. &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot; was the first album Clapton ever bought; he later saw Holly on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. In his autobiography, Clapton recounts the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heaven ... it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: &#x27;That&#x27;s the future – that&#x27;s what I want. In the 2017 documentary film, &quot;Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars&quot;, Clapton cites Bismillah Khan as an influence, adding that &quot;I wanted my guitar to sound like his reed instrument.&quot; In the same documentary he also cited harmonica player Little Walter as an influence: &quot;The sound he made with the harmonica playing through an amplifier. It was thick and fat and very melodic.&quot;

==Legacy==

Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. He ranked second in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and fourth in &quot;Gibson&#x27;s&quot; Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.

In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributed the creation of the cult of the guitar hero to Clapton, ranking it number seven on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history;

Elias Leight of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes that Clapton &quot;influenced recording techniques as well as guitar-playing technique&quot;. During recording sessions with John Mayall&#x27;s group, Clapton was frustrated by technicians &quot;that just came up to your amp with the microphone and just stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier. It seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere we were getting in the clubs, you needed it to sound like you were in the audience 10 feet away, not three inches&quot;. Clapton then moved the microphones, with Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters stating, &quot;That changed everything. Before Eric, guitar playing in England had been Hank Marvin of the Shadows, very simple, not much technique. Suddenly we heard something completely different. The records sounded unlike anything we had heard before.&quot;

In 2012, Clapton was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday. Indelibly linked to the Royal Albert Hall in London, a venue he has played at more than any other in his 50-year plus career, Clapton was inducted into the Royal Albert Hall&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2018, making him one of the first eleven recipients of a star on the walk, thus joining Muhammad Ali, Winston Churchill, the Suffragettes, and Albert Einstein, among others who were viewed as &quot;key players&quot; in the building&#x27;s history.

Robert Christgau, in a dissenting appraisal of Clapton&#x27;s legacy, writes:
Due to Clapton&#x27;s impact in the music industry, he has also been mentioned in several songs. In &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving You&quot;, MJ Lenderman sings, &quot;Believe that Clapton is the second coming&quot;, a reference to &quot;Clapton is God&quot;. Phoebe Bridgers mentions Clapton in &quot;Moon Song&quot;, with the lyrics &quot;We hate &#x27;Tears in Heaven&#x27; / But it&#x27;s sad that his baby died&quot;, a reference to the death of Clapton&#x27;s child, Conor. However, the original lyric, which she sometimes performs live, is &quot;We hate Eric Clapton&quot; instead of &quot;We hate &#x27;Tears in Heaven&#x27;.&quot; She has said the lyric is because he is &quot;a famous racist&quot; and makes &quot;extremely mediocre music&quot;.

==Guitars==

Like Hank Marvin, the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, Clapton exerted a crucial and widespread influence in popularising particular models of electric guitar. With the Yardbirds, Clapton played a Fender Telecaster, a Fender Jazzmaster, a double-cutaway Gretsch 6120, and a 1964 Cherry-Red Gibson ES-335. He became exclusively a Gibson player for a period beginning in mid-1965, when he purchased a used sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar from a guitar store in London. Clapton commented on the slim profile of the neck, which would indicate it was a 1960 model.

Early during his stint in Cream, Clapton&#x27;s first Les Paul Standard was stolen. He continued to play Les Pauls exclusively with Cream (one bought from Andy Summers was almost identical to the stolen guitar) until 1967, when he acquired his most famous guitar in this period, a 1964 Gibson SG, dubbed &quot;the Fool&quot;. Clapton used both the Les Paul and the SG to create his self-described &quot;woman tone&quot;. He explained in a 1967 interview, &quot;I am playing more smoothly now. I&#x27;m developing what I call my &#x27;woman tone.&#x27; It&#x27;s a sweet sound, something like the solo on &#x27;I Feel Free&#x27;.&quot; Writer Michael Dregni describes it as &quot;thick yet piercing, overdriven yet smooth, distorted yet creamy&quot;. The tone is achieved by a combination of tone control settings on the guitars and Clapton&#x27;s Marshall JTM45 amplifier. &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; magazine identifies &quot;the opening riff and solo of &#x27;Sunshine of Your Love&#x27; are arguably the best illustrations of full-blown woman tone&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Fool&quot; acquired its name from its distinctive psychedelic paint job, created by the visual art collective also known as the Fool (just before Cream&#x27;s first US appearance in 1967, Clapton&#x27;s SG, Bruce&#x27;s Fender VI, and Baker&#x27;s drum head were all repainted in psychedelic designs).
In 1968, Clapton bought a Gibson Firebird and started using the 1964 Cherry-Red Gibson ES-335 again. The aforementioned 1964 ES-335 had a storied career. Clapton used it at the last Cream show in November 1968 as well as with Blind Faith, played it sparingly for slide pieces in the 1970s, used it on &quot;Hard Times&quot; from &quot;Journeyman&quot;, the Hyde Park live concert of 1996, and the &quot;From the Cradle&quot; sessions and tour of 1994–95. It was sold for US$847,500 at a 2004 auction. Gibson produced a limited run of 250 &quot;Crossroads 335&quot; replicas. The 335 was only the second electric guitar Clapton bought.

In July 1968 Clapton gave George Harrison a 1957 &#x27;goldtop&#x27; Gibson Les Paul that been refinished with a red colour, nicknamed Lucy. The following September, Clapton played the guitar on the Beatles&#x27; recording of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Lucy was stolen from Harrison, though later tracked down and returned to him – he lent it to Clapton for his 1973 comeback concert at the Rainbow. His SG &quot;The Fool&quot; found its way into the hands of George Harrison&#x27;s friend Jackie Lomax, who subsequently sold it to musician Todd Rundgren for US$500 in 1972. Rundgren restored the guitar and nicknamed it &quot;Sunny&quot;, after &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. He retained it until 2000, when he sold it at an auction for US$150,000. At the 1969 Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park, London Clapton played a Fender Custom Telecaster, which was fitted with &quot;Brownie&quot;″s neck.
In late 1969 Clapton made the switch to the Fender Stratocaster. &quot;I had a lot of influences when I took up the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly, and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn&#x27;t really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, if he can do it, I can do it&quot;. The first—used during the recording of &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;—was &quot;Brownie&quot;, which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton&#x27;s guitars, &quot;Blackie&quot;. In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison, Steve Winwood, and Pete Townshend. His first Stratocaster, Brownie, was purchased on 7 May 1967 and made its debut in 1970 on his first solo album, in concert with Derek and the Dominos as well on the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. 

Clapton assembled the best components of the remaining three to create &quot;Blackie&quot;, which was his favourite stage guitar until its retirement in 1985. It was first played live 1973 at the Rainbow Concert. Clapton called the 1956/57 Strat a &quot;mongrel&quot;. On 2004, Clapton sold &quot;Blackie&quot; at Christie&#x27;s Auction House, New York, for US$959,500 to raise funds for his Crossroads Centre for drug and alcohol addictions. &quot;Brownie&quot; is now on display at the Experience Music Project. The Fender Custom Shop has since produced a limited run of 275 &#x27;Blackie&#x27; replicas, correct in every detail right down to the &#x27;Duck Brothers&#x27; flight case, and artificially aged using Fender&#x27;s &quot;Relic&quot; process to simulate years of hard wear. One was presented to Clapton upon the model&#x27;s release and was used for three numbers during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 2006. In 1979, Clapton gave his signed Fender Lead II guitar to the Hard Rock Cafe in London to designate his favourite bar stool. Pete Townshend also donated his own Gibson Les Paul guitar, with a note attached: &quot;Mine&#x27;s as good as his! Love, Pete&quot;.

Signature guitars in Clapton&#x27;s honour are made by Fender and C.F. Martin &amp; Company. In 1988, Fender introduced his signature Eric Clapton Stratocaster. Several signature-model 000-sized acoustic guitars made by Martin. The first, of these, introduced in 1995, was a limited edition 000-42EC Eric Clapton signature model with a production run of 461. For the single &quot;Change the World&quot; (1996) and the album &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (1998) he used a Martin 000-28 EC Eric Clapton signature model, which he subsequently gave to guitarist Paul Wassif. His 1939 000-42 Martin that he played on the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album sold for US$791,500 at auction. Clapton uses Ernie Ball Slinky and Super Slinky strings, gauge .10 to.46. His guitar technician for over thirty years was Lee Dickson.

== Other media appearances ==

Clapton appeared in the movie version of &quot;Tommy&quot;, the first full-length rock opera, written by the Who. In the movie version, Clapton appeared as the Preacher, performing Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s song, &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; as one of the Louisiana Gator Boys. In addition to being in the band, he had a small speaking role. Clapton has appeared in an advertisement for the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen. In March 2007 Clapton appeared in an advertisement for RealNetwork&#x27;s Rhapsody online music service. In 2010, Clapton started appearing as a spokesman for T-Mobile, advertising their MyTouch Fender cell phone. Clapton also appeared in the 2011 BBC documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot;, which was described as &quot;The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica.&quot;

When asked to describe God by their minister, the characters Eric Forman and Steven Hyde both drew an image of Clapton in the episode &quot;Holy Crap!&quot; of season two of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

Clapton appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2013, during Series 19 Episode 4 and was involved in testing the new Kia Ceed. He was called upon to test the Ceed&#x27;s auxiliary input, which he tested by plugging in one of his guitars and playing several bars of his most famous hits. He was introduced by &quot;Top Gear&quot; host Jeremy Clarkson as a &quot;local guitarist&quot;.

In 2017, a documentary film titled &quot;Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars&quot; was directed by Lili Fini Zanuck. Clapton wrote the film score for Zanuck&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Rush&quot; and the two remained friends. In an interview for BBC News, Zanuck said that Clapton only agreed to participate if she directed it:
Nothing but the Blues is a 1995 documentary film about Clapton&#x27;s musical journey and his love for the blues. Martin Scorsese was one of the executive producers.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Clapton&#x27;s partner from the late 1960s to 1974 was Alice Ormsby-Gore, a British aristocrat. They were together for three years and were both addicted to heroin. He briefly dated funk singer Betty Davis. 

Clapton became friends with George Harrison in the late 1960s and they began writing and recording music together. Clapton fell in love with Pattie Boyd, who was married to Harrison at this time. Harrison and Boyd divorced in 1977 and she married Clapton on 27 March 1979, in Tucson, Arizona. Their marriage was marred by his infidelities and domestic violence. During a 1999 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Clapton admitted to raping and abusing her when they were married and he was a &quot;full-blown&quot; alcoholic who felt entitled to sex. In 1984, while recording &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, Clapton began a relationship with Yvonne Kelly, the manager of AIR Studios Montserrat. Although both were married to other partners at the time, they had a daughter named Ruth Kelly Clapton in January 1985. Ruth&#x27;s existence was kept from the public until the media realised she was his child in 1991.

Clapton and Boyd tried unsuccessfully to have children, even trying in vitro fertilisation in 1984, but were faced instead with miscarriages. He had an affair with Italian model Lory Del Santo, who gave birth to their son, Conor, on 21 August 1986. Clapton and Boyd later divorced in 1989 after she was &quot;utterly devastated&quot; by his confession to impregnating Del Santo during this affair. Conor died on 20 March 1991 at the age of four after falling out of an open bedroom window on the 53rd floor of a Manhattan apartment building.

In 1998, Clapton, then 53, met 22-year-old administrative assistant Melia McEnery in Columbus, Ohio, at a party given for him after a performance. He quietly dated her for a year, and went public with the relationship in 1999. They married on 2002 at St Mary Magdalene Church in Clapton&#x27;s birthplace, Ripley. They have three daughters, Julie Rose (born 2001), Ella May (born 2003), and Sophie Belle (born 2005).

===Health===
Clapton gave up drugs and alcohol in 1982, after a period of addiction. A former heavy cigarette smoker, Clapton quit smoking in 1994.

== Political opinions ==

=== &quot;Keep Britain White&quot; ===
On 5 August 1976, Clapton spoke out against increasing immigration during a concert in Birmingham. Visibly intoxicated on stage, Clapton voiced his support for the right-wing British politician Enoch Powell. He addressed the audience as follows:
&quot;Keep Britain White&quot; was, at the time, a slogan of the far-right National Front (NF). This incident, along with some controversial remarks made around the same time by David Bowie, were the main catalysts for the creation of Rock Against Racism, with a concert on 30 April 1978.

In an interview from October 1976 with &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, Clapton said that he did not &quot;know much about politics&quot; and said of his immigration speech that &quot;I just don&#x27;t know what came over me that night. It must have been something that happened in the day but it came out in this garbled thing.&quot; In a 2004 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot;, Clapton referred to Enoch Powell as &quot;outrageously brave&quot;. He said that the UK was &quot;inviting people in as cheap labour and then putting them in ghettos&quot;. In 2004, Clapton told an interviewer for &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I could be a racist. It would make no sense.&quot; In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton said he was &quot;deliberately oblivious&quot; to racial conflict. In a December 2007 interview with Melvyn Bragg on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, Clapton said he was not a racist but still believed Powell&#x27;s comments were relevant.

In 2018 Clapton stated he was &quot;disgusted&quot; with himself for his &quot;chauvinistic&quot; and &quot;fascistic&quot; comments on stage. He added: &quot;I sabotaged everything I got involved with. I was so ashamed of who I was, a kind of semi-racist, which didn&#x27;t make sense. Half of my friends were black, I dated a black woman, and I championed black music.&quot;

=== Opposition to fox-hunting ban ===
Clapton supports the Countryside Alliance, which promotes field sports and issues relating to the British countryside. He has played in concerts to raise funds for the organisation and publicly opposed the Labour Party&#x27;s ban on fox hunting with the Hunting Act 2004. A spokesperson for Clapton said, &quot;Eric supports the Countryside Alliance. He does not hunt himself, but does enjoy rural pursuits such as fishing and shooting. He supports the Alliance&#x27;s pursuit to scrap the ban on the basis that he disagrees with the state&#x27;s interference with people&#x27;s private pursuits.&quot;

=== COVID-19 ===
In November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Clapton and Van Morrison collaborated on an anti-mask, anti-lockdown single entitled &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, the profits from which were donated to Morrison&#x27;s Lockdown Financial Hardship Fund. Morrison&#x27;s stance was criticised by Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann. In July 2021, Clapton wrote that he would &quot;not perform on any stage where there is a discriminated audience present&quot;, in response to Boris Johnson mandating that concert attendees be vaccinated. Clapton had by then taken both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and said he had had severe reactions to both injections. Whether the symptoms he reported were actually vaccine-related was called into question by an NBC News editorial, given that Clapton previously reported suffering the same symptoms as early as 2013 due to nerve damage.

In August 2021, Clapton released the single &quot;This Has Gotta Stop&quot; and an accompanying music video. It was described as a protest song against COVID-19 lockdowns, vaccinations, and contains lyrical and visual statements against what Clapton sees as the erosion of civil liberties as the result of lockdown policies.

Clapton tested positive for COVID-19 in May 2022 causing him to cancel some concerts in his tour schedule.

=== Israel–Palestine conflict ===
In November 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Clapton released a song titled &quot;Voice of a Child&quot;, along with a video featuring images of destruction in the Gaza Strip. In December 2023, Clapton organized a charity concert to raise funds for children in the Gaza Strip. During the event, he played a guitar painted with the colors of the Palestinian flag.

== Assets and philanthropy ==

===Wealth and assets===
In 2009, &quot;Surrey Life Magazine&quot; ranked Clapton as number 17 in their list of richest Surrey residents, estimating his fortune at £120 million in assets. This was a combination of income, property, a £9 million yacht, &quot;Va Bene&quot; (previously owned by Bernie Ecclestone), his back music catalogue, his touring income, and his holding company Marshbrook Ltd, which had earned him £110 million since 1989. In 2003, he purchased a 50% share of gentleman&#x27;s outfitters Cordings Piccadilly. At the time, owner Noll Uloth was trying to save the shop from closure and contacted Clapton, his &quot;best client&quot;; within five minutes, Clapton replied with &quot;I can&#x27;t let this happen&quot;.

===Car collection===

Since the 1970s, Clapton has considered himself a &quot;car enthusiast&quot; and has often stated his passion for the Ferrari brand. Clapton owns or has owned a range of Ferraris, and when asked about his Ferrari collection in 1989, he said he liked the touring cars the company produces for road use and commented &quot;if I had more space and if I had been wise I would have a huge collection by now and I would be a multi-multi-millionaire&quot;. In 2010, he explained that for him &quot;Ferrari has always been the number one car&quot; to own and drive, and that he always supported Ferrari on the road and in Formula One motor racing.

In 2012, Ferrari honoured Clapton with the one-off special project car, the Ferrari SP12 EC. In July 2013 Clapton displayed it at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England in the Michelin Supercar Run. In 2014, Clapton explained that Ferrari is still his favourite car brand. Among the other vehicles Clapton owns or has owned are a vintage Mini Cooper Radford that was a gift from George Harrison.

===Charitable work===

In 1993, Clapton was appointed a director of Clouds House, a UK treatment centre for drug and alcohol dependence, and was a member of the board until 1997. He also served on the board of directors for The Chemical Dependency Centre from 1994 until 1999. The two charities subsequently merged to become Action on Addiction in 2007.

In 1998, Clapton established the Crossroads Centre in Antigua to help others to overcome addiction to drugs and alcohol. He has remained active in its management oversight and fundraising to the present day. He organised the Crossroads Guitar Festival in 1999, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2019 to raise funds for the centre. In 1999, Clapton auctioned off some of his guitar collection and raised more than US$5 million for continued support of the Crossroads Centre. A second guitar auction, which included the &quot;Cream&quot; of Clapton&#x27;s collection, as well as guitars donated by famous friends, was held on 2004 at Christie&#x27;s and raised US$7,438,624. His Lowden acoustic guitar sold for US$41,825. 

In 2011, Clapton sold over 150 items at a New York auction, with the proceeds going to the Crossroads Centre. Items sold included his guitar from the Cream reunion tour in 2005, speaker cabinets used in the early 1970s from his days with Derek and the Dominos, and guitars from Jeff Beck, J. J. Cale, and Joe Bonamassa. In March 2011, Clapton raised more than £1.3 million when he auctioned off 138 lots, consisting of 75 guitars and 55 amps from his personal collection, including a 1948 Gibson hollow body guitar; a Gianni Versace suit from his 1990 concert at the Royal Albert Hall; and a replica of his famous Fender Stratocaster known as &quot;Blackie&quot;, which fetched more than $30,000. All proceeds went to Crossroads.

Clapton has performed at the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese on behalf of Amnesty International. He made his first appearance at the show, held in London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1981, and subsequently became an activist. Clapton has collaborated with The Prince&#x27;s Trust, the leading UK youth charity, which provides training, personal development, business start up support, mentoring, and advice. He has performed at the charity&#x27;s rock concert numerous times since the 1980s, most recently in 2010. In 2008, he donated a song to Aid Still Required&#x27;s CD to assist with the restoration of Southeast Asia after the devastation inflicted by the 2004 tsunami.

===Football===
Clapton is a fan of English football club West Bromwich Albion. In 1982, he performed a concert before West Brom player John Wile&#x27;s testimonial game at The Hawthorns. It has been reported that the club rejected his offer to invest cash in the club around this time. In the late 1970s Clapton positioned a West Brom scarf on the back cover of his album, &quot;Backless&quot;. In the 1978–79 season Clapton sponsored West Brom&#x27;s UEFA Cup home game against Turkish club Galatasaray.

==Clapton&#x27;s music in film and TV==
Clapton&#x27;s music has appeared in dozens of movies and television shows as far back as 1973&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, which included the Derek and the Dominos song &quot;I Looked Away&quot; and a performance of &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; by Cream. Other appearances in media include in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; series (&quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Waiting&quot;, and &quot;Layla&quot;), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (&quot;Heaven Is One Step Away&quot;), &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot;), &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; (&quot;Knockin&#x27; On Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;), &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (&quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;), &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m With the Band&quot; (&quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, &quot;White Room&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot;), &quot;Friends&quot; episodes &quot;The One with the Proposal, Part 2&quot; (&quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;) and &quot;The One Where Rachel Has A Baby&quot; (&quot;River of Tears&quot;), &quot;School Of Rock&quot; (&quot;Sunshine Of Your Love)&quot;, &quot;Men in Black III&quot; (&quot;Strange Brew&quot;), &quot;Captain Phillips&quot; (&quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;Lay Down Sally&quot;), &quot;Good Girls Revolt&quot; episode &quot;The Year-Ender&quot; (&quot;White Room)&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;The Vat of Acid Episode&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot;) and &quot;Joker&quot; (&quot;White Room&quot;).

Both Opel and Vauxhall used the guitar riff from &quot;Layla&quot; in their advertising campaigns throughout 1987–95. In addition to his music appearing in media, Clapton has contributed to several movies by writing or co-writing the musical scores or contributing original songs. These movies include &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (co-written with Michael Kamen), &quot;Communion&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Phenomenon&quot; (&quot;Change the World&quot;), and &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; (co-wrote and co-performed &quot;It&#x27;s Probably Me&quot; with Sting and &quot;Runaway Train&quot; with Elton John).

<doc id="10055" wikidata="Q156318" url="?curid=10055" title="Etiology">
<text>Etiology (; alternatively spelled aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation or origination. The word is derived from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;giving a reason for&quot; (). More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves. The word is commonly used in medicine (pertaining to causes of disease or illness) and in philosophy, but also in physics, biology, psychology, political science, geography, cosmology, spatial analysis and theology in reference to the causes or origins of various phenomena.

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, myths often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; is a national myth written to explain and glorify the origins of the Roman Empire. In theology, many religions have creation myths explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==

In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, epidemiological studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor&#x27;s disease, scurvy, was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, Captain James Cook suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet. Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat sauerkraut, a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he inferred that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology; the lack of vitamin C in a sailor&#x27;s diet.

The following are examples of intrinsic factors:
* Inherited conditions, or conditions that are passed down to you from your parents. An example of this is hemophilia, a disorder that leads to excessive bleeding.
* Metabolic and endocrine, or hormone, disorders. These are abnormalities in the chemical signaling and interaction in the body. For example, Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disease that causes high blood sugar.
* Neoplastic disorders or cancer where the cells of the body grow out of control.
* Problems with immunity, such as allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system.

== Mythology ==

An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a myth intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name Delphi and its associated deity, &quot;Apollon Delphinios&quot;, are explained in the Homeric Hymn which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a dolphin (&#x27;), propelled Cretans over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word &#x27; (&quot;womb&quot;), many etiological myths are similarly based on folk etymology (the term &quot;Amazon&quot;, for example). In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (published ), Virgil claims the descent of Augustus Caesar&#x27;s Julian clan from the hero Aeneas through his son Ascanius, also called Iulus. The story of Prometheus&#x27; sacrifice trick at Mecone in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; relates how Prometheus tricked Zeus into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

<text>In chemistry, the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms present in a compound. A simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sulfur monoxide, or SO, is simply SO, as is the empirical formula of disulfur dioxide, S2O2. Thus, sulfur monoxide and disulfur dioxide, both compounds of sulfur and oxygen, have the same empirical formula. However, their molecular formulas, which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound, are not the same.

An empirical formula makes no mention of the arrangement or number of atoms. It is standard for many ionic compounds, like calcium chloride (CaCl2), and for macromolecules, such as silicon dioxide (SiO2).

The molecular formula, on the other hand, shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule. The structural formula shows the arrangement of the molecule. It is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas.

In the early days of chemistry, information regarding the composition of compounds came from elemental analysis, which gives information about the relative amounts of elements present in a compound, which can be written as percentages or mole ratios. However, chemists were not able to determine the exact amounts of these elements and were only able to know their ratios, hence the name &quot;empirical formula&quot;. Since ionic compounds are extended networks of anions and cations, all formulas of ionic compounds are empirical.

== Examples ==
* Glucose (), ribose (), Acetic acid (), and formaldehyde () all have different molecular formulas but the same empirical formula: . This is the actual molecular formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms, ribose has five times the number of atoms, and glucose has six times the number of atoms.

==Calculation example==
A chemical analysis of a sample of methyl acetate provides the following elemental data: 48.64% carbon (C), 8.16% hydrogen (H), and 43.20% oxygen (O). For the purposes of determining empirical formulas, it&#x27;s assumed that we have 100 grams of the compound. If this is the case, the percentages will be equal to the mass of each element in grams.

:Step 1: Change each percentage to an expression of the mass of each element in grams. That is, 48.64% C becomes 48.64 g C, 8.16% H becomes 8.16 g H, and 43.20% O becomes 43.20 g O.

:Step 2: Convert the amount of each element in grams to its amount in moles
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

:Step 3: Divide each of the resulting values by the smallest of these values (2.7)
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6

:Step 4: If necessary, multiply these numbers by integers in order to get whole numbers; if an operation is done to one of the numbers, it must be done to all of them.
:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9

Thus, the empirical formula of methyl acetate is . This formula also happens to be methyl acetate&#x27;s molecular formula.

<doc id="10067" wikidata="Q1347378" url="?curid=10067" title="Episcopal polity">
<text>An episcopal polity is a hierarchical form of church governance in which the chief local authorities are called bishops. The word &quot;bishop&quot; here is derived via the British Latin and Vulgar Latin term &quot;*ebiscopus&quot;/&quot;*biscopus&quot;, from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;overseer&quot;. It is the structure used by many of the major Christian Churches and denominations, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anabaptist, Lutheran, and Anglican churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages. Many Methodist denominations have a form of episcopal polity known as connexionalism.

==History==

Churches with an episcopal polity are governed by bishops, practising their authorities in the dioceses and conferences or synods. Their leadership is both sacramental and constitutional; as well as performing ordinations, confirmations, and consecrations, the bishop supervises the clergy within a local jurisdiction and is the representative both to secular structures and within the hierarchy of the church. 

Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal apostolic succession from the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the historical episcopate or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see 1 Timothy 3 and 2 Timothy 1). In some systems, bishops may be subject in limited ways to bishops holding a higher office (variously called archbishops, metropolitans, or patriarchs, depending upon the tradition). They also meet in councils or synods. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the synod or council may also be purely advisory.

For much of the written history of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the Reformation. Many Protestant churches are now organized by either congregational or presbyterian church polities, both descended from the writings of John Calvin, a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the Catholic Church precipitated by The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther. However, some people have disputed the episcopal polity before the reformation, such as Aerius of Sebaste in the 4th century.

==Overview of episcopal churches==

The definition of the word &quot;episcopal&quot; has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in ecclesiology, that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, &quot;episcopal churches&quot; are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops who identify as being in an unbroken, personal apostolic succession.

&quot;Episcopal&quot; is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of denominations. For instance, &quot;Presbyterian&quot; (, presbýteros) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected elders, referred to as presbyterian polity. Similarly, &quot;episcopal&quot; is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as &quot;congregational&quot;.

More specifically, the capitalized appellation &quot;Episcopal&quot; is applied to several churches historically based within Anglicanism (&quot;Episcopalianism&quot;), including those still in communion with the Church of England.

Using these definitions, examples of specific episcopal churches include:
* The Catholic Church
* The Eastern Orthodox Church
* The Oriental Orthodox Churches
* The Assyrian Church of the East
* The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church
* The Churches of the Anglican Communion
* The Old Catholic churches
* Numerous smaller &quot;catholic&quot; churches
* Certain national churches of the Lutheran confession
* The African Methodist Episcopal Church
* The United Methodist Church

Some Lutheran churches practice congregational polity or a form of presbyterian polity. Others, including the Church of Sweden, practice episcopal polity; the Church of Sweden also counts its bishops among the historic episcopate. This is also the case with some American Lutheran churches, such as the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, Lutheran Orthodox Church, Lutheran Church - International, and the Lutheran Episcopal Communion.

Many Methodist churches (the United Methodist Church, among others) retain the form and function of episcopal polity, although in a modified form, called connexionalism. Since all trace their ordinations to an Anglican priest, John Wesley, it is generally considered that their bishops do not share in apostolic succession. However, United Methodists affirm that their bishops share in the historic episcopate.

==Formation==
The Apostle Paul in the Epistle to the Philippians, Clement of Rome and the &quot;Didache&quot; when talking about the ecclesial system of governance, mention “bishops and deacons”, without the word “presbyter”, which has been argued by some to show that there was no presbyter-bishop distinction yet in the first century.

Ignatius of Antioch, writing in already the early second century, makes a clear distinction of bishops and presbyters, meaning that his letters show that an episcopal system was already in existence by his time. However, Bart Erhman sees it as significant that Ignatius never mentioned a bishop in Rome. Later, Tertullian also very clearly distinguishes the presbyters and bishops as a separate office, Irenaeus made lists of the succession of bishops, though such lists made by the early Church Fathers are highly contradictory. By the second century, it appears that the episcopal system had become the majority, universal view among Christians.

Even schismatic sects such as the Novatians and Donatists would also use the episcopal framework, except for Aerius of Sebaste, who contested the system and began his own sect.

Jerome stated that churches were originally governed by a group of presbyters, only later electing bishops to suppress schisms.

==Catholic Church==

The Catholic Church has an episcopate, with the Pope, who is the Bishop of Rome, at the top. The Catholic Church considers juridical oversight over the Church is not a power derived from human beings, but strictly from the authority of Christ, which was given to his twelve apostles. The See of Rome, as the unbroken line of apostolic authority descending from Saint Peter the Apostle (the “Prince and Head of the Apostles”), is a visible sign and &quot;locus&quot; of communion among the College of Bishops, and therefore also of local churches around the world. In communion with these churches and their bishops, the Pope has all legitimate juridical and infallible teaching authority over the whole Church. This authority given by Christ to Saint Peter and the apostles is transmitted from one generation to the next by the power of the Holy Spirit, through the laying on of hands from the Apostles to the bishops, in unbroken succession.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==

The conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all autocephalous primates are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth. There is no single primate with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the , the &quot;first among equals&quot; of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy.

==Oriental Orthodox churches==
The Oriental Orthodox Churches affirm the ideas of apostolic succession and episcopal government. Within each national Church, the bishops form a holy synod to which even the Patriarch is subject. The Syriac Orthodox Church traces its apostolic succession to St. Peter and recognises Antioch as the original See of St. Peter. The Armenian Apostolic Church traces its lineage to the Apostle Bartholomew. The Indian Orthodox Church traces its lineage to the Apostle Thomas. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church received its lines of succession (Frumentius) through the Coptic Orthodox Church in the fifth century.

Both the Greek and Coptic Orthodox Churches each recognise their own Pope of Alexandria (Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, and Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria respectively), both of whom trace their apostolic succession back to the figure Mark the Evangelist. There are official, ongoing efforts in recent times to heal this ancient breach. Already, the two recognize each other&#x27;s baptisms, chrismations, and marriages, making intermarriage much easier.

==Church of the East==

Historically, the Church of the East has traced its episcopal succession to St. Thomas the Apostle. Currently the bishops of the Assyrian Church of the East continue to maintain its apostolic succession.

==Lutheran Churches==
Lutheran Churches, such as the Church of Sweden and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya, maintain apostolic succession. In countries such as Sweden, Catholic bishops became Lutheran bishops during the Reformation, continuing the ancient lines of apostolic succession.

Through Swedish missionary work and the establishment of Lutheran Churches in various countries, such as in Kenya, apostolic succession was continued in those denominations, such as in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Southern Africa, Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Malaysia, and Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zimbabwe, among others.

The Lutheran Church - International, a Confessional Lutheran denomination of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship has an episcopal polity, with its clergy being ordained in lines of apostolic succession.

==Anglican Communion==

Anglicanism is a Reformation tradition that lays claim to the historic episcopate through apostolic succession in terms comparable to the various Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and certain Lutheran Communions. Anglicans assert unbroken episcopal succession in and through the Church of England back to St. Augustine of Canterbury and to the first century Roman province of Britannia. While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the Synod of Whitby, the church in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.

The legislation of Henry VIII effectively establishing the independence of the Church of England from Rome did not alter its constitutional or pastoral structures. Royal supremacy was exercised through the extant legal structures of the church, whose leaders were bishops. Episcopacy was thus seen as a given of the Reformed &quot;Ecclesia Anglicana&quot;, and a foundation in the institution&#x27;s appeal to ancient and apostolic legitimacy. What did change was that bishops were now seen to be ministers of the Crown for the spiritual government of its subjects. The influence of Richard Hooker was crucial to an evolution in this understanding in which bishops came to be seen in their more traditional role as ones who delegate to the presbyterate inherited powers, act as pastors to presbyters, and holding a particular teaching office with respect to the wider church.
Anglican opinion has differed as to the way in which episcopal government is &quot;de jure divino&quot; (by the Divine Right of Kings). On the one hand, the seventeenth century divine, John Cosin, held that episcopal authority is &quot;jure divino&quot;, but that it stemmed from &quot;apostolic practice and the customs of the Church ... [not] absolute precept that either Christ or His Apostles gave about it&quot; (a view maintained also by Hooker). In contrast, Lancelot Andrewes and others held that episcopal government is derived from Christ via the apostles. Regardless, both parties viewed the episcopacy as bearing the apostolic function of oversight which both includes, and derives from, the power of ordination, and is normative for the governance of the church. The practice of apostolic succession both ensures the legitimacy of the church&#x27;s mission and establishes the unity, communion, and continuity of the local church with the universal church. This formulation, in turn, laid the groundwork for an independent view of the church as a &quot;sacred society&quot; distinct from civil society, which was so crucial for the development of local churches as non-established entities outside England, and gave direct rise to the Catholic Revival and disestablishmentarianism within England.

Functionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed synodically, although individual provinces may accord their primate with more or less authority to act independently. Called variously &quot;synods&quot;, &quot;councils&quot;, or &quot;conventions&quot;, they meet under episcopal chairmanship. In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force. Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of &quot;the bishop-in-synod&quot; as the force and authority of episcopal governance. Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, discipline, and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism&#x27;s tradition of the limits of authority. Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the Council of Trent was drawing to a close), which held that &quot;General Councils ... may err, and sometimes have erred ... wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.&quot; Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see &quot;lex orandi, lex credendi&quot;).

Anglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the Anglican Communion, their ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the presbyterate and laity.

There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition&#x27;s common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the See of Canterbury, along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions is to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and catholic nature of the church.

The Scottish Episcopal Church traces its history back to the origins of Christianity in Scotland. Following the 1560 Scottish Reformation the Church of Scotland was initially run by Superintendents, episcopal governance was restored in 1572, but episcopalianism alternated with periods when the Kirk was under presbyterian control until the 1711 Act allowed formation of the independent non-established Scottish Episcopal Church. The Nonjuring schism led to the British Government imposing penal laws against the church. In 1784 the Scottish church appointed Samuel Seabury as first bishop of the American Episcopal Church, beginning the worldwide Anglican Communion of churches, and in 1792 the penal laws were abolished. The church accepted the articles of the Church of England in 1804. 
The spread of increasingly democratic forms of representative governance has its origin in the formation of the first General Conventions of the American Episcopal Church in the 1780s, which established a &quot;House of Bishops&quot; and a &quot;House of Deputies&quot;. In many jurisdictions, there is also a third, clerical House. Resolutions may be voted on jointly or by each House, in the latter case requiring passage in all Houses to be adopted by the particular council.

Churches that are members of the Anglican Communion are episcopal churches in polity, and some are named &quot;Episcopal&quot;. However, some churches that self-identify as Anglican do not belong to the Anglican Communion, and not all episcopally-governed churches are Anglican. The Roman Catholic Church, the Old Catholic Churches (in full communion with, but not members of, the Anglican Communion), and the Eastern Orthodox churches are recognized, and also their bishops, by Anglicans.

==Methodist churches==

A number of Methodist churches often use episcopal polity for historical as well as practical reasons, albeit to limited use. Methodists often use the term &quot;connexionalism&quot; or &quot;connexional polity&quot; in addition to &quot;episcopal&quot;. Nevertheless, the powers of the Methodist episcopacy can be relatively strong and wide-reaching compared to traditional conceptions of episcopal polity. 

In the Free Methodist Church, bishops are elected.

In the United Methodist Church, bishops are elected for life, can serve up to two terms in a specific conference (three if special permission is given), are responsible for ordaining and appointing clergy to pastor churches, perform many administrative duties, preside at the annual sessions of the regional Conferences and at the quadrennial meeting of the worldwide General Conference, have authority for teaching and leading the church on matters of social and doctrinal import, and serve to represent the denomination in ecumenical gatherings. United Methodist bishops in the United States serve in their appointed conferences, being moved to a new &quot;Episcopal Area&quot; after 8 (or 12) years, until their mandated retirement at the end of the quadrennium following their sixty-sixth birthday.

The Methodist Church in Great Britain holds that all ordained ministers are equal in terms of spirituality. However, for practical management lines are drawn into President of Conference, Chair of District, Superintendent Minister, Minister. However, all are ministers. The Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches is non-episcopal. Similarly, the Congregational Methodist Church has a congregational polity.

==Anabaptist Churches==
Most Anabaptist churches of the plain dress tradition follow an episcopal system, at least in name. Congregational governance is strongly emphasized, and each congregation elects its pastor. Bishops enforce inter-congregational unity and may discipline pastors for breaking from traditional norms.

== Other Protestant churches ==
The Reformed Church of Hungary and Lutheran churches in continental Europe may sometimes be called “episcopal”. In these latter cases, the form of government is not radically different from the presbyterian form, except that their councils of bishops have hierarchical jurisdiction over the local ruling bodies to a greater extent than in most Presbyterian and other Reformed churches. As mentioned, the Lutheran Church in Sweden and Finland (along with Lutheran Churches established in various parts of the world by missionaries from these denominations) are exceptions, claiming apostolic succession in a pattern somewhat like the Anglican churches. Otherwise, forms of polity are not mandated in the Lutheran churches, as it is not regarded as having doctrinal significance. Old World Lutheranism, for historical reasons, has tended to adopt Erastian theories of episcopal authority (by which church authority is to a limited extent sanctioned by secular government). In the United States, Lutheran churches tend to adopt a form of government that grants congregations more independence, but ultimately has an episcopal structure. A small minority of Episcopal Baptists exists.

== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==
Although it never uses the term, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (informally known as the LDS Church) is episcopal, rather than presbyterian or congregational, in the sense that it has a strict hierarchy of leadership from the local bishop/branch president up to a single prophet/president, believed to be personally authorized and guided by Jesus Christ. Local congregations (branches, wards, and stakes) have &quot;de jure&quot; boundaries by which members are allocated, and membership records are centralized. This system developed gradually from a more presbyterian polity (Joseph Smith&#x27;s original title in 1830 was &quot;First Elder&quot;) for pragmatic and doctrinal reasons, reaching a full episcopacy during the Nauvoo period (1839–1846).

<doc id="10070" wikidata="Q144713" url="?curid=10070" title="East Slavic languages">
<text>The East Slavic languages constitute one of three regional subgroups of the Slavic languages, distinct from the West and South Slavic languages. East Slavic languages are currently spoken natively throughout Eastern Europe, and eastwards to Siberia and the Russian Far East. In part due to the large historical influence of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, the Russian language is also spoken as a lingua franca in many regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Of the three Slavic branches, East Slavic is the most spoken, with the number of native speakers larger than the Western and Southern branches combined.

The common consensus is that Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian are the extant East Slavic languages. Some linguists also consider Rusyn a separate language, although it is sometimes considered a dialect of Ukrainian.

The modern East Slavic languages descend from a common predecessor spoken in Kievan Rus&#x27; from the 9th to 13th centuries, which later evolved into Ruthenian, the chancery language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Dnieper river valley, and into medieval Russian in the Volga river valley, the language of the Russian principalities including the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

All these languages use the Cyrillic script, but with particular modifications. Belarusian and Ukrainian, which are descendants of Ruthenian, have a tradition of using Latin-based alphabets—the Belarusian Lacinka and the Ukrainian Latynka alphabets, respectively (also Rusyn uses Latin in some regions, e.g. in Slovakia).

== Distribution ==


== Classification ==
Modern East Slavic languages include Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian. The Rusyn language is sometimes considered the fourth living language of the group, its status as an independent language being the subject of scientific debate.

== Distinctive features ==

=== Vocabulary ===
The East Slavic territory exhibits a linguistic continuum with many transitional dialects. Between Belarusian and Ukrainian there is the Polesian dialect, which shares features from both languages. East Polesian is a transitional variety between Belarusian and Ukrainian on one hand, and between South Russian and Ukrainian on the other hand. At the same time, Belarusian and Southern Russian form a continuous area, making it virtually impossible to draw a line between the two languages. Central or Middle Russian (with its Moscow sub-dialect), the transitional step between the North and the South, became a base for the Russian literary standard. Northern Russian with its predecessor, the Old Novgorod dialect, has many original and archaic features.

Ruthenian, the ancestor of modern Belarusian and Ukrainian, was the official language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as &quot;Chancery Slavonic&quot; until the end of the 17th century when it was gradually replaced by the Polish language. It was also the native language of the Cossack Hetmanate until the end of the 18th century, when the Ukrainian state completely became part of the Russian Empire in 1764. The Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk from 1710 is one of the most important written sources of the Ruthenian language. Due to the influence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth over many centuries, Belarusian and Ukrainian have been influenced in several respects by Polish, a Lechitic West Slavic language. As a result of the long Polish-Lithuanian rule, these languages had been less exposed to Church Slavonic, featuring therefore less Church Slavonicisms than the modern Russian language, for example:

Additionally, the original East Slavic phonetic form was kept in many words in Ukrainian and Belarusian, for example:

In general, Ukrainian and Belarusian are also closer to other Western European languages, especially to German (via Polish). At the same time Russian was being heavily influenced by Church Slavonic (South Slavic language), but also by the Turkic and Uralic languages. For example:

What&#x27;s more, all three languages do also have false friends, that sometimes can lead to (big) misunderstandings. For example, Ukrainian орати (&quot;oraty&quot;) — &quot;to plow&quot; and Russian орать (&quot;orat́&quot;) — &quot;to scream&quot;, or Ukrainian помітити (&quot;pomityty&quot;) — &quot;to notice&quot; and Russian пометить (&quot;pometit́&quot;) — &quot;to mark&quot;.

===Orthography===

==== Alphabet ====
The alphabets of the East Slavic languages are all written in the Cyrillic script, however each of them has their own letters and pronunciations. Russian and Ukrainian have 33 letters, while Belarusian has 32. Additionally, Belarusian and Ukrainian use the apostrophe (&#x27;) for the hard sign, which has the same function as the letter Ъ in Russian.

Some letters, that are not included in the alphabet of a language, can be written as digraphs. For example, the sound values of the letter Ё, which doesn&#x27;t exist in the Ukrainian alphabet, can be written as ЙО (ЬО before and after consonants), while the letter Щ in Russian and Ukrainian corresponds to ШЧ in Belarusian (compare Belarusian плошча and Ukrainian площа (&quot;area&quot;)).

There are also different rules of usage for certain letters, e.g. the soft sign (Ь) cannot be written after the letter Ц in Russian, because the consonant /tsʲ/ does not exist in the Russian language, while in Ukrainian and especially Belarusian, on the contrary, it is relatively common (Ukrainian ць etymologically corresponds to Russian and Belarusian ц; Belarusian ць etymologically corresponds to Russian and Ukrainian ть). Moreover, the letter Щ in standard Russian is always pronounced softly (palatalization).

Standard Ukrainian, unlike all the other Slavic languages (excl. Serbo-Croatian), does not exhibit final devoicing. Nevertheless, this rule is not that clear when listening to colloquial Ukrainian. It&#x27;s one of the typical deviations that occur in the Ukrainian spoken language.

==== Different sound values of letters ====
Besides the differences of the alphabets, some letters represent different sounds depending on the language. For example, the letter И (romanized as &quot;I&quot; for Russian and &quot;Y&quot; for Ukrainian) in Russian is mostly pronounced as (identical with the Ukrainian І), while in Ukrainian it&#x27;s mostly pronounced as (very similar to the Russian Ы).

===Notes===
==History==

===Influence of Church Slavonic===
After the conversion of the East Slavic region to Christianity the people used service books borrowed from Bulgaria, which were written in Old Church Slavonic (a South Slavic language). The Church Slavonic language was strictly used only in text, while the colloquial language of the Bulgarians was communicated in its spoken form.

Throughout the Middle Ages (and in some way up to the present day) there existed a duality between the Church Slavonic language used as some kind of &#x27;higher&#x27; register (not only) in religious texts and the popular tongue used as a &#x27;lower&#x27; register for secular texts. It has been suggested to describe this situation as &quot;diglossia&quot;, although there do exist mixed texts where it is sometimes very hard to determine why a given author used a popular or a Church Slavonic form in a given context. Church Slavonic was a major factor in the evolution of modern Russian, where there still exists a &quot;high stratum&quot; of words that were imported from this language.

Gracen made her professional feature film debut in &quot;Three For The Road&quot; with Charlie Sheen. Her film credits also include a featured role in &quot;Marked for Death&quot;, opposite Steven Seagal, &quot;Pass The Ammo&quot; with Tim Curry, and the CBS feature &quot;83 Hours Till Dawn&quot; with Peter Strauss and Robert Urich. Gracen starred in &quot;Lower Level&quot; and &quot;Discretion Assured&quot; with Michael York.

On television, Gracen has appeared in Shelley Duvall&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s &quot;The Sands of Time,&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot;. She also appeared with a starring role in the series &quot;Extreme&quot; for NBC and the syndicated series &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Queen of Swords&quot;.

Gracen&#x27;s best-known acting role has been as the recurring character Amanda, a 1,200-year-old immortal, in the series &quot;&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;&quot;.
In December 1999, Gracen filed for bankruptcy protection. After few television guest roles, and a supporting role in the made-for-television movie &quot;Interceptor Force 2&quot;, she took a long leave of absence from acting, beginning in 2002. Gracen began doing voiceover work for Blue Hours Productions, which has revived the classic radio anthology &quot;Suspense&quot;, which airs on Sirius XM. In 2012, Gracen did a character voice-over in the Malaysian animated science fiction film &quot;War of the Worlds: Goliath&quot;.

===Directing, producing, and writing===
In 2012, Gracen formed Flapper Films. In 2014, she starred in &quot;Coherence&quot;, a sci-fi indie thriller. In January 2016, Gracen established Flapper Press and self-published &quot;Shalilly&quot;, a young adult fantasy novel.

Gracen made her directorial debut with a documentary short, &quot;The Damn Deal,&quot; about three young drag queens from Arkansas who compete in female impersonator beauty pageants.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===
Gracen married Jon Birmingham in 1982, and they divorced in 1984.

In 1989, while filming &quot;&quot;, she met actor Brendan Hughes, and they married soon after. They divorced in 1994.

Gracen married Adam Murphy, and they have a daughter.

===Affair with Bill Clinton===
According to Gracen, some time in 1983, she had a one-night stand with future President Bill Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. She was married at the time, as was he.

In 1992, rumors swirled that Gracen had had an affair with Clinton. At first, Gracen dismissed this claim (as requested by Clinton&#x27;s campaign manager Mickey Kantor); however, in spring 1998 Gracen recanted her six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1983. Gracen stated that &quot;What I did was wrong, and I feel very, very bad about it now. My behavior was inappropriate -- that&#x27;s just the bottom line&quot; and publicly apologized to Hillary Clinton.

After her claim, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit, issued a subpoena to have her testify to her claim in court. However, Gracen eluded the subpoena and was at one point able to avoid it because &quot;&quot; was being filmed outside of the US. Paula Jones&#x27;s legal team was also unable to track down Gracen because she had made unscheduled trips to Las Vegas and the Caribbean.

<doc id="10073" wikidata="Q43216" url="?curid=10073" title="Epicurus">
<text>Epicurus (, ; ; 341–270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as &quot;the Garden&quot;, in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been lost. Only three letters written by him—the letters to &quot;Menoeceus&quot;, &quot;Pythocles&quot;, and &quot;Herodotus&quot;—and two collections of quotes—the &quot;Principal Doctrines&quot; and the &quot;Vatican Sayings&quot;—have survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his work&#x27;s destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes Laërtius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, as well as the hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.

Epicurus asserted that philosophy&#x27;s purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy (&quot;eudaimonic&quot;), tranquil lives characterized by &quot;ataraxia&quot; (peace and freedom from fear) and &quot;aponia&quot; (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neuroses is denial of death and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the gods exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the gods punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining &quot;ataraxia&quot;.

Epicurus derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus ( 460– 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as &quot;atoms&quot;. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic &quot;swerve&quot;, which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.

Though popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages, Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx.

==Life==
===Upbringing and influences===
Epicurus was born in the Athenian settlement on the Aegean island of Samos in February 341 BC. His parents, Neocles and Chaerestrate, were both Athenian-born, and his father was an Athenian citizen. Epicurus grew up during the final years of the Greek Classical Period. Plato had died seven years before Epicurus was born and Epicurus was seven years old when Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont into Persia. As a child, Epicurus would have received a typical ancient Greek education. As such, according to Norman Wentworth DeWitt, &quot;it is inconceivable that he would have escaped the Platonic training in geometry, dialectic, and rhetoric.&quot; Epicurus is known to have studied under the instruction of a Samian Platonist named Pamphilus, probably for about four years. His &quot;Letter of Menoeceus&quot; and surviving fragments of his other writings strongly suggest that he had extensive training in rhetoric. After the death of Alexander the Great, Perdiccas expelled the Athenian settlers on Samos to Colophon, on the coast of what is now Turkey. Epicurus joined his family there after the completion of his military service. He studied under Nausiphanes, who followed the teachings of Democritus, and later those of Pyrrho, whose way of life Epicurus greatly admired.

Epicurus&#x27;s teachings were heavily influenced by those of earlier philosophers, particularly Democritus. Nonetheless, Epicurus differed from his predecessors on several key points of determinism and vehemently denied having been influenced by any previous philosophers, whom he denounced as &quot;confused&quot;. Instead, he insisted that he had been &quot;self-taught&quot;. According to DeWitt, Epicurus&#x27;s teachings also show influences from the contemporary philosophical school of Cynicism. The Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope was still alive when Epicurus would have been in Athens for his required military training and it is possible they may have met. Diogenes&#x27;s pupil Crates of Thebes ( 365 – 285 BC) was a close contemporary of Epicurus. Epicurus agreed with the Cynics&#x27; quest for honesty, but rejected their &quot;insolence and vulgarity&quot;, instead teaching that honesty must be coupled with courtesy and kindness. Epicurus shared this view with his contemporary, the comic playwright Menander.

Epicurus&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, possibly an early work of his, is written in an eloquent style similar to that of the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates (436–338 BC), but, for his later works, he seems to have adopted the bald, intellectual style of the mathematician Euclid. Epicurus&#x27;s epistemology also bears an unacknowledged debt to the later writings of Aristotle (384–322 BC), who rejected the Platonic idea of hypostatic Reason and instead relied on nature and empirical evidence for knowledge about the universe. During Epicurus&#x27;s formative years, Greek knowledge about the rest of the world was rapidly expanding due to the Hellenization of the Near East and the rise of Hellenistic kingdoms. Epicurus&#x27;s philosophy was consequently more universal in its outlook than those of his predecessors, since it took cognizance of non-Greek peoples as well as Greeks. He may have had access to the now-lost writings of the historian and ethnographer Megasthenes, who wrote during the reign of Seleucus I Nicator (ruled 305–281 BC).

===Teaching career===
During Epicurus&#x27;s lifetime, Platonism was the dominant philosophy in higher education. Epicurus&#x27;s opposition to Platonism formed a large part of his thought. Over half of the forty Principal Doctrines of Epicureanism are flat contradictions of Platonism. In around 311 BC, Epicurus, when he was around thirty years old, began teaching in Mytilene. Around this time, Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, arrived in Athens, at the age of about twenty-one, but Zeno did not begin teaching what would become Stoicism for another twenty years. Although later texts, such as the writings of the first-century BC Roman orator Cicero, portray Epicureanism and Stoicism as rivals, this rivalry seems to have only emerged after Epicurus&#x27;s death.

Epicurus&#x27;s teachings caused strife in Mytilene and he was forced to leave. He then founded a school in Lampsacus before returning to Athens in 306 BC, where he remained until his death. There he founded The Garden (κῆπος), a school named for the garden he owned that served as the school&#x27;s meeting place, about halfway between the locations of two other schools of philosophy, the Stoa and the Academy. The Garden was more than just a school; it was &quot;a community of like-minded and aspiring practitioners of a particular way of life.&quot; The primary members were Hermarchus, the financier Idomeneus, Leonteus and his wife Themista, the satirist Colotes, the mathematician Polyaenus of Lampsacus, and Metrodorus of Lampsacus, the most famous popularizer of Epicureanism. His school was the first of the ancient Greek philosophical schools to admit women as a rule rather than an exception, and the biography of Epicurus by Diogenes Laërtius lists female students such as Leontion and Nikidion. An inscription on the gate to The Garden is recorded by Seneca the Younger in epistle XXI of : &quot;Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.&quot;

According to Diskin Clay, Epicurus himself established a custom of celebrating his birthday annually with common meals, befitting his stature as &quot;heros ktistes&quot; (&quot;founding hero&quot;) of the Garden. He ordained in his will annual memorial feasts for himself on the same date (10th of Gamelion month). Epicurean communities continued this tradition, referring to Epicurus as their &quot;saviour&quot; (soter) and celebrating him as hero. The hero cult of Epicurus may have operated as a Garden variety civic religion. However, clear evidence of an Epicurean hero cult, as well as the cult itself, seems buried by the weight of posthumous philosophical interpretation. Epicurus never married and had no known children. He was most likely a vegetarian.

===Death===
Diogenes Laërtius records that, according to Epicurus&#x27;s successor Hermarchus, Epicurus died a slow and painful death in 270 BC at the age of seventy-two from a stone blockage of his urinary tract. Despite being in immense pain, Epicurus is said to have remained cheerful and to have continued to teach until the very end. Possible insights into Epicurus&#x27;s death may be offered by the extremely brief &quot;Epistle to Idomeneus&quot;, included by Diogenes Laërtius in Book X of his &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;. The authenticity of this letter is uncertain and it may be a later pro-Epicurean forgery intended to paint an admirable portrait of the philosopher to counter the large number of forged epistles in Epicurus&#x27;s name portraying him unfavorably.

I have written this letter to you on a happy day to me, which is also the last day of my life. For I have been attacked by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you to take care of the children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.

If authentic, this letter would support the tradition that Epicurus was able to remain joyful to the end, even in the midst of his suffering. It would also indicate that he maintained a special concern for the wellbeing of children.

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Epicurus and his followers had a well-developed epistemology, which developed as a result of their rivalry with other philosophical schools. Epicurus wrote a treatise entitled , or &quot;Rule&quot;, in which he explained his methods of investigation and theory of knowledge. This book, however, has not survived, nor does any other text that fully and clearly explains Epicurean epistemology, leaving only mentions of this epistemology by several authors to reconstruct it. Epicurus rejected the Platonic idea of &quot;Reason&quot; as a reliable source of knowledge about the world apart from the senses and was bitterly opposed to the Pyrrhonists and Academic Skeptics, who not only questioned the ability of the senses to provide accurate knowledge about the world, but also whether it is even possible to know anything about the world at all.

Epicurus maintained that the senses never deceive humans, but that the senses can be misinterpreted. Epicurus held that the purpose of all knowledge is to aid humans in attaining &quot;ataraxia&quot;. He taught that knowledge is learned through experiences rather than innate and that the acceptance of the fundamental truth of the things a person perceives is essential to a person&#x27;s moral and spiritual health. In the &quot;Letter to Pythocles&quot;, he states, &quot;If a person fights the clear evidence of his senses he will never be able to share in genuine tranquility.&quot; Epicurus regarded gut feelings as the ultimate authority on matters of morality and held that whether a person feels an action is right or wrong is a far more cogent guide to whether that act really is right or wrong than abstracts maxims, strict codified rules of ethics, or even reason itself.

Epicurus believed that any statement that is not directly contrary to human perception can be considered possibly true. On the other hand, anything contrary to experience can be ruled out as false. Epicureans often used analogies to everyday experience to support their argument of so-called &quot;imperceptibles&quot;, which included anything that a human being cannot perceive, such as the motion of atoms. In line with this principle of non-contradiction, the Epicureans believed that events in the natural world may have multiple causes that are all equally possible and probable. Lucretius writes in &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, as translated by William Ellery Leonard:
&lt;poem&gt;There be, besides, some thing
Of which &#x27;tis not enough one only cause
To state—but rather several, whereof one
Will be the true: lo, if thou shouldst espy
Lying afar some fellow&#x27;s lifeless corse,
&#x27;Twere meet to name all causes of a death,
That cause of his death might thereby be named:
For prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,
By cold, nor even by poison nor disease,
Yet somewhat of this sort hath come to him
We know—And thus we have to say the same
In divers cases.&lt;/poem&gt;
Epicurus strongly favored naturalistic explanations over theological ones. In his &quot;Letter to Pythocles&quot;, he offers four different possible natural explanations for thunder, six different possible natural explanations for lightning, three for snow, three for comets, two for rainbows, two for earthquakes, and so on. Although all of these explanations are now known to be false, they were an important step in the history of science, because Epicurus was trying to explain natural phenomena using natural explanations, rather than resorting to inventing elaborate stories about gods and mythic heroes.

===Ethics===
Epicurus was a hedonist, meaning he taught that what is pleasurable is morally good and what is painful is morally evil. He idiosyncratically defined &quot;pleasure&quot; as the absence of suffering and taught that all humans should seek to attain the state of &quot;ataraxia&quot;, meaning &quot;untroubledness&quot;, a state in which the person is completely free from all pain or suffering. He argued that most of the suffering which human beings experience is caused by the irrational fears of death, divine retribution, and punishment in the afterlife. In his &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, Epicurus explains that people seek wealth and power on account of these fears, believing that having more money, prestige, or political clout will save them from death. He, however, maintains that death is the end of existence, that the terrifying stories of punishment in the afterlife are ridiculous superstitions, and that death is therefore nothing to be feared. He writes in his &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;: &quot;Accustom thyself to believe that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply sentience, and death is the privation of all sentience;... Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.&quot; From this doctrine arose the Epicurean epitaph: &quot;Non fui, fui, non-sum, non-curo&quot; (&quot;I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care&quot;), which is inscribed on the gravestones of his followers and seen on many ancient gravestones of the Roman Empire. This quotation is often used today at humanist funerals.

The Tetrapharmakos presents a summary of the key points of Epicurean ethics:

* Don&#x27;t fear god
* Don&#x27;t worry about death
* What is good is easy to get
* What is terrible is easy to endure

Although Epicurus has been commonly misunderstood as an advocate of the rampant pursuit of pleasure, he, in fact, maintained that a person can only be happy and free from suffering by living wisely, soberly, and morally. He strongly disapproved of raw, excessive sensuality and warned that a person must take into account whether the consequences of his actions will result in suffering, writing, &quot;the pleasant life is produced not by a string of drinking bouts and revelries, nor by the enjoyment of boys and women, nor by fish and the other items on an expensive menu, but by sober reasoning.&quot; He also wrote that a single good piece of cheese could be equally pleasing as an entire feast. Furthermore, Epicurus taught that &quot;it is not possible to live pleasurably without living sensibly and nobly and justly&quot;, because a person who engages in acts of dishonesty or injustice will be &quot;loaded with troubles&quot; on account of his own guilty conscience and will live in constant fear that his wrongdoings will be discovered by others. A person who is kind and just to others, however, will have no fear and will be more likely to attain &quot;ataraxia&quot;.

Epicurus distinguished between two different types of pleasure: &quot;moving&quot; pleasures (κατὰ κίνησιν ἡδοναί) and &quot;static&quot; pleasures (καταστηματικαὶ ἡδοναί). &quot;Moving&quot; pleasures occur when one is in the process of satisfying a desire and involve an active titillation of the senses. After one&#x27;s desires have been satisfied (e.g. when one is full after eating), the pleasure quickly goes away and the suffering of wanting to fulfill the desire again returns. For Epicurus, static pleasures are the best pleasures because moving pleasures are always bound up with pain. Epicurus had a low opinion of sex and marriage, regarding both as having dubious value. Instead, he maintained that platonic friendships are essential to living a happy life. One of the &quot;Principal Doctrines&quot; states, &quot;Of the things wisdom acquires for the blessedness of life as a whole, far the greatest is the possession of friendship.&quot; He also taught that philosophy is itself a pleasure to engage in. One of the quotes from Epicurus recorded in the &quot;Vatican Sayings&quot; declares, &quot;In other pursuits, the hard-won fruit comes at the end. But in philosophy, delight keeps pace with knowledge. It is not after the lesson that enjoyment comes: learning and enjoyment happen at the same time.&quot;

Epicurus distinguishes between three types of desires: natural and necessary, natural but unnecessary, and vain and empty. Natural and necessary desires include the desires for food and shelter. These are easy to satisfy, difficult to eliminate, bring pleasure when satisfied, and are naturally limited. Going beyond these limits produces unnecessary desires, such as the desire for luxury foods. Although food is necessary, luxury food is not necessary. Correspondingly, Epicurus advocates a life of hedonistic moderation by reducing desire, thus eliminating the unhappiness caused by unfulfilled desires. Vain desires include desires for power, wealth, and fame. These are difficult to satisfy because no matter how much one gets, one can always want more. These desires are inculcated by society and by false beliefs about what we need. They are not natural and are to be shunned.

Epicurus&#x27; teachings were introduced into medical philosophy and practice by the Epicurean doctor Asclepiades of Bithynia, who was the first physician who introduced Greek medicine in Rome. Asclepiades introduced the friendly, sympathetic, pleasing and painless treatment of patients. He advocated humane treatment of mental disorders, had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. His teachings are surprisingly modern; therefore Asclepiades is considered to be a pioneer physician in psychotherapy, physical therapy and molecular medicine.

===Physics===
Epicurus writes in his &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot; (not the historian) that &quot;nothing ever arises from the nonexistent&quot;, indicating that all events therefore have causes, regardless of whether those causes are known or unknown. Similarly, he also writes that nothing ever passes away into nothingness, because, &quot;if an object that passes from our view were completely annihilated, everything in the world would have perished, since that into which things were dissipated would be nonexistent.&quot; He therefore states: &quot;The totality of things was always just as it is at present and will always remain the same because there is nothing into which it can change, inasmuch as there is nothing outside the totality that could intrude and effect change.&quot; Like Democritus before him, Epicurus taught that all matter is entirely made of extremely tiny particles called &quot;atoms&quot; (; &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;indivisible&quot;). For Epicurus and his followers, the existence of atoms was a matter of empirical observation; Epicurus&#x27;s devoted follower, the Roman poet Lucretius, cites the gradual wearing down of rings from being worn, statues from being kissed, stones from being dripped on by water, and roads from being walked on in &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; as evidence for the existence of atoms as tiny, imperceptible particles.

Also like Democritus, Epicurus was a materialist who taught that the only things that exist are atoms and void. Void occurs in any place where there are no atoms. Epicurus and his followers believed that atoms and void are both infinite and that the universe is therefore boundless. In &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, Lucretius argues this point using the example of a man throwing a javelin at the theoretical boundary of a finite universe. He states that the javelin must either go past the edge of the universe, in which case it is not really a boundary, or it must be blocked by something and prevented from continuing its path, but, if that happens, then the object blocking it must be outside the confines of the universe. As a result of this belief that the universe and the number of atoms in it are infinite, Epicurus and the Epicureans believed that there must also be infinitely many worlds within the universe.

Epicurus taught that the motion of atoms is constant, eternal, and without beginning or end. He held that there are two kinds of motion: the motion of atoms and the motion of visible objects. Both kinds of motion are real and not illusory. Democritus had described atoms as not only eternally moving, but also eternally flying through space, colliding, coalescing, and separating from each other as necessary. In a rare departure from Democritus&#x27;s physics, Epicurus posited the idea of atomic &quot;swerve&quot; ( &quot;&quot;; ), one of his best-known original ideas. According to this idea, atoms, as they are travelling through space, may deviate slightly from the course they would ordinarily be expected to follow. Epicurus&#x27;s reason for introducing this doctrine was because he wanted to preserve the concepts of free will and ethical responsibility while still maintaining the deterministic physical model of atomism. Lucretius describes it, saying, &quot;It is this slight deviation of primal bodies, at indeterminate times and places, which keeps the mind as such from experiencing an inner compulsion in doing everything it does and from being forced to endure and suffer like a captive in chains.&quot;

Epicurus was first to assert human freedom as a result of the fundamental indeterminism in the motion of atoms. This has led some philosophers to think that, for Epicurus, free will was &quot;caused directly by chance&quot;. In his &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, Lucretius appears to suggest this in the best-known passage on Epicurus&#x27; position. In his &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, however, Epicurus follows Aristotle and clearly identifies &quot;three&quot; possible causes: &quot;some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through our own agency.&quot; Aristotle said some things &quot;depend on us&quot; (&quot;eph&#x27;hemin&quot;). Epicurus agreed, and said it is to these last things that praise and blame naturally attach. For Epicurus, the &quot;swerve&quot; of the atoms simply defeated determinism to leave room for autonomous agency.

===Theology===
In his &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, a summary of his own moral and theological teachings, the first piece of advice Epicurus himself gives to his student is: &quot;First, believe that a god is an indestructible and blessed animal, in accordance with the general conception of god commonly held, and do not ascribe to god anything foreign to his indestructibility or repugnant to his blessedness.&quot; Epicurus maintained that he and his followers knew that the gods exist because &quot;our knowledge of them is a matter of clear and distinct perception&quot;, meaning that people can empirically sense their presences. He did not mean that people can see the gods as physical objects, but rather that they can see visions of the gods sent from the remote regions of interstellar space in which they actually reside. According to George K. Strodach, Epicurus could have easily dispensed of the gods entirely without greatly altering his materialist worldview, but the gods still play one important function in Epicurus&#x27;s theology as the paragons of moral virtue to be emulated and admired.

Epicurus rejected the conventional Greek view of the gods as anthropomorphic beings who walked the earth like ordinary people, fathered illegitimate offspring with mortals, and pursued personal feuds. Instead, he taught that the gods are morally perfect, but detached and immobile beings who live in the remote regions of interstellar space. In line with these teachings, Epicurus adamantly rejected the idea that deities were involved in human affairs in any way. Epicurus maintained that the gods are so utterly perfect and removed from the world that they are incapable of listening to prayers or supplications or doing virtually anything aside from contemplating their own perfections. In his &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot;, he specifically denies that the gods have any control over natural phenomena, arguing that this would contradict their fundamental nature, which is perfect, because any kind of worldly involvement would tarnish their perfection. He further warned that believing that the gods control natural phenomena would only mislead people into believing the superstitious view that the gods punish humans for wrongdoing, which only instills fear and prevents people from attaining &quot;ataraxia&quot;.

Epicurus himself criticizes popular religion in both his &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot; and his &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot;, but in a restrained and moderate tone. Later Epicureans mainly followed the same ideas as Epicurus, believing in the existence of the gods, but emphatically rejecting the idea of divine providence. Their criticisms of popular religion, however, are often less gentle than those of Epicurus himself. The &quot;Letter to Pythocles&quot;, written by a later Epicurean, is dismissive and contemptuous towards popular religion and Epicurus&#x27;s devoted follower, the Roman poet Lucretius ( 99 BC – 55 BC), passionately assailed popular religion in his philosophical poem &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;. In this poem, Lucretius declares that popular religious practices not only do not instill virtue, but rather result in &quot;misdeeds both wicked and ungodly&quot;, citing the mythical sacrifice of Iphigenia as an example. Lucretius argues that divine creation and providence are illogical, not because the gods do not exist, but rather because these notions are incompatible with the Epicurean principles of the gods&#x27; indestructibility and blessedness. The later Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus ( 160 – 210 AD) rejected the teachings of the Epicureans specifically because he regarded them as theological &quot;Dogmaticists&quot;.

====Epicurean paradox====

The Epicurean paradox or riddle of Epicurus or Epicurus&#x27; trilemma is a version of the problem of evil. Lactantius attributes this trilemma to Epicurus in &quot;De Ira Dei&quot;, 13, 20-21:
God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is , which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God, from what source then are evils? Or why does He not remove them?
In &quot;Dialogues concerning Natural Religion&quot; (1779), David Hume also attributes the argument to Epicurus:
Epicurus’s old questions are yet unanswered. Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?
No extant writings of Epicurus contain this argument. However, the vast majority of Epicurus&#x27;s writings have been lost and it is possible that some form of this argument may have been found in his lost treatise &quot;On the Gods&quot;, which Diogenes Laërtius describes as one of his greatest works. If Epicurus really did make some form of this argument, it would not have been an argument against the existence of deities, but rather an argument against divine providence. Epicurus&#x27;s extant writings demonstrate that he did believe in the existence of deities. Furthermore, religion was such an integral part of daily life in Greece during the early Hellenistic Period that it is doubtful anyone during that period could have been an atheist in the modern sense of the word. Instead, the Greek word (&quot;átheos&quot;), meaning &quot;without a god&quot;, was used as a term of abuse, not as an attempt to describe a person&#x27;s beliefs.

===Politics===
Epicurus promoted an innovative theory of justice as a social contract. Justice, Epicurus said, is an agreement neither to harm nor be harmed, and we need to have such a contract in order to enjoy fully the benefits of living together in a well-ordered society. Laws and punishments are needed to keep misguided fools in line who would otherwise break the contract. But the wise person sees the usefulness of justice, and because of his limited desires, he has no need to engage in the conduct prohibited by the laws in any case. Laws that are useful for promoting happiness are just, but those that are not useful are not just. (&quot;Principal Doctrines&quot; 31–40)

Epicurus discouraged participation in politics, as doing so leads to perturbation and status seeking. He instead advocated not drawing attention to oneself. This principle is epitomised by the phrase &quot;lathe biōsas&quot; (), meaning &quot;live in obscurity&quot;, &quot;get through life without drawing attention to yourself&quot;, i.e., live without pursuing glory or wealth or power, but anonymously, enjoying little things like food, the company of friends, etc. Plutarch elaborated on this theme in his essay &quot;Is the Saying &quot;Live in Obscurity&quot; Right?&quot; (, &quot;An recte dictum sit latenter esse vivendum&quot;) 1128c; cf. Flavius Philostratus, &quot;Vita Apollonii&quot; 8.28.12.

==Works==

Epicurus was an extremely prolific writer. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he wrote around 300 treatises on a variety of subjects. Although more original writings of Epicurus have survived to the present day than of any other Hellenistic Greek philosopher, the vast majority of everything he wrote has still been lost, and most of what is known about Epicurus&#x27;s teachings come from the writings of his later followers, particularly the Roman poet Lucretius. The only surviving complete works by Epicurus are three relatively lengthy letters, which are quoted in their entirety in Book X of Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, and two groups of quotes: the &quot;Principal Doctrines&quot; (Κύριαι Δόξαι), which are likewise preserved through quotation by Diogenes Laërtius, and the &quot;Vatican Sayings&quot;, preserved in a manuscript from the Vatican Library that was first discovered in 1888. In the &quot;Letter to Herodotus&quot; and the &quot;Letter to Pythocles&quot;, Epicurus summarizes his philosophy on nature and, in the &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, he summarizes his moral teachings. Numerous fragments of Epicurus&#x27;s lost thirty-seven volume treatise &quot;On Nature&quot; have been found among the charred papyrus fragments at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. Scholars first began attempting to unravel and decipher these scrolls in 1800, but the efforts are painstaking and are still ongoing.
According to Diogenes Laertius (10.27-9), the major works of Epicurus include:

# On Nature, in 37 books

==Legacy==
===Ancient Epicureanism===

Epicureanism was extremely popular from the very beginning. Diogenes Laërtius records that the number of Epicureans throughout the world exceeded the populations of entire cities. Nonetheless, Epicurus was not universally admired and, within his own lifetime, he was vilified as an ignorant buffoon and egoistic sybarite. He remained the most simultaneously admired and despised philosopher in the Mediterranean for the next nearly five centuries. Epicureanism rapidly spread beyond the Greek mainland all across the Mediterranean world. By the first century BC, it had established a strong foothold in Italy. The Roman orator Cicero (106 – 43 BC), who deplored Epicurean ethics, lamented, &quot;the Epicureans have taken Italy by storm.&quot;

The overwhelming majority of surviving Greek and Roman sources are vehemently negative towards Epicureanism and, according to Pamela Gordon, they routinely depict Epicurus himself as &quot;monstrous or laughable&quot;. Many Romans in particular took a negative view of Epicureanism, seeing its advocacy of the pursuit of &quot;voluptas&quot; (&quot;pleasure&quot;) as contrary to the Roman ideal of &quot;virtus&quot; (&quot;manly virtue&quot;). The Romans therefore often stereotyped Epicurus and his followers as weak and effeminate. Prominent critics of his philosophy include prominent authors such as the Roman Stoic Seneca the Younger ( 4 BC – AD 65) and the Greek Middle Platonist Plutarch ( 46 – 120), who both derided these stereotypes as immoral and disreputable. Gordon characterizes anti-Epicurean rhetoric as so &quot;heavy-handed&quot; and misrepresentative of Epicurus&#x27;s actual teachings that they sometimes come across as &quot;comical&quot;. In his &quot;De vita beata&quot;, Seneca states that the &quot;sect of Epicurus... has a bad reputation, and yet it does not deserve it.&quot; and compares it to &quot;a man in a dress: your chastity remains, your virility is unimpaired, your body has not submitted sexually, but in your hand is a tympanum.&quot;

Epicureanism was a notoriously conservative philosophical school; although Epicurus&#x27;s later followers did expand on his philosophy, they dogmatically retained what he himself had originally taught without modifying it. Epicureans and admirers of Epicureanism revered Epicurus himself as a great teacher of ethics, a savior, and even a god. His image was worn on finger rings, portraits of him were displayed in living rooms, and wealthy followers venerated likenesses of him in marble sculpture. His admirers revered his sayings as divine oracles, carried around copies of his writings, and cherished copies of his letters like the letters of an apostle. On the twentieth day of every month, admirers of his teachings would perform a solemn ritual to honor his memory. At the same time, opponents of his teachings denounced him with vehemence and persistence.

However, in the first and second centuries AD, Epicureanism gradually began to decline as it failed to compete with Stoicism, which had an ethical system more in line with traditional Roman values. Epicureanism also suffered decay in the wake of Christianity, which was also rapidly expanding throughout the Roman Empire. Of all the Greek philosophical schools, Epicureanism was the one most at odds with the new Christian teachings, since Epicureans believed that the soul was mortal, denied the existence of an afterlife, denied that the divine had any active role in human life, and advocated pleasure as the foremost goal of human existence. As such, Christian writers such as Justin Martyr ( 100– 165 AD), Athenagoras of Athens ( 133– 190), Tertullian ( 155– 240), and Clement of Alexandria ( 150– 215), Arnobius (died 330), and Lactantius (c. 250-c.325) all singled it out for the most vitriolic criticism.

In spite of this, DeWitt argues that Epicureanism and Christianity share much common language, calling Epicureanism &quot;the first missionary philosophy&quot; and &quot;the first world philosophy&quot;. Both Epicureanism and Christianity placed strong emphasis on the importance of love and forgiveness and early Christian portrayals of Jesus are often similar to Epicurean portrayals of Epicurus. DeWitt argues that Epicureanism, in many ways, helped pave the way for the spread of Christianity by &quot;helping to bridge the gap between Greek intellectualism and a religious way of life&quot; and &quot;shunt[ing] the emphasis from the political to the social virtues and offer[ing] what may be called a religion of humanity.&quot;

===Middle Ages===
By the early fifth century AD, Epicureanism was virtually extinct. The Christian Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) declared, &quot;its ashes are so cold that not a single spark can be struck from them.&quot; While the ideas of Plato and Aristotle could easily be adapted to suit a Christian worldview, the ideas of Epicurus were not nearly as easily amenable. As such, while Plato and Aristotle enjoyed a privileged place in Christian philosophy throughout the Middle Ages, Epicurus was not held in such esteem. Information about Epicurus&#x27;s teachings was available, through Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, quotations of it found in medieval Latin grammars and &quot;florilegia&quot;, and encyclopedias, such as Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (seventh century) and Hrabanus Maurus&#x27;s &quot;De universo&quot; (ninth century), but there is little evidence that these teachings were systematically studied or comprehended.

During the Middle Ages, Epicurus was remembered by the educated as a philosopher, but he frequently appeared in popular culture as a gatekeeper to the Garden of Delights, the &quot;proprietor of the kitchen, the tavern, and the brothel.&quot; He appears in this guise in Martianus Capella&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Mercury and Philology&quot; (fifth century), John of Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;Policraticus&quot; (1159), John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Mirour de l&#x27;Omme&quot;, and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. Epicurus and his followers appear in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; in the Sixth Circle of Hell, where they are imprisoned in flaming coffins for having believed that the soul dies with the body.

===Renaissance===
In 1417, a manuscript-hunter named Poggio Bracciolini discovered a copy of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; in a monastery near Lake Constance. The discovery of this manuscript was met with immense excitement, because scholars were eager to analyze and study the teachings of classical philosophers and this previously forgotten text contained the most comprehensive account of Epicurus&#x27;s teachings known in Latin. The first scholarly dissertation on Epicurus, &quot;De voluptate&quot; (&quot;On Pleasure&quot;) by the Italian Humanist and Catholic priest Lorenzo Valla was published in 1431. Valla made no mention of Lucretius or his poem. Instead, he presented the treatise as a discussion on the nature of the highest good between an Epicurean, a Stoic, and a Christian. Valla&#x27;s dialogue ultimately rejects Epicureanism, but, by presenting an Epicurean as a member of the dispute, Valla lent Epicureanism credibility as a philosophy that deserved to be taken seriously.

None of the Quattrocento Humanists ever clearly endorsed Epicureanism, but scholars such as Francesco Zabarella (1360–1417), Francesco Filelfo (1398–1481), Cristoforo Landino (1424–1498), and Leonardo Bruni ( 1370–1444) did give Epicureanism a fairer analysis than it had traditionally received and provided a less overtly hostile assessment of Epicurus himself. Nonetheless, &quot;Epicureanism&quot; remained a pejorative, synonymous with extreme egoistic pleasure-seeking, rather than a name of a philosophical school. This reputation discouraged orthodox Christian scholars from taking what others might regard as an inappropriately keen interest in Epicurean teachings. Epicureanism did not take hold in Italy, France, or England until the seventeenth century. Even the liberal religious skeptics who might have been expected to take an interest in Epicureanism evidently did not; Étienne Dolet (1509–1546) only mentions Epicurus once in all his writings and François Rabelais (between 1483 and 1494–1553) never mentions him at all. Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) is the exception to this trend, quoting a full 450 lines of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; in his &quot;Essays&quot;. His interest in Lucretius, however, seems to have been primarily literary and he is ambiguous about his feelings on Lucretius&#x27;s Epicurean worldview. During the Protestant Reformation, the label &quot;Epicurean&quot; was bandied back and forth as an insult between Protestants and Catholics.

===Revival===
In the seventeenth century, the French Catholic priest and scholar Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) sought to dislodge Aristotelianism from its position of the highest dogma by presenting Epicureanism as a better and more rational alternative. In 1647, Gassendi published his book &quot;De vita et moribus Epicuri&quot; (&quot;The Life and Morals of Epicurus&quot;), a passionate defense of Epicureanism. In 1649, he published a commentary on Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Epicurus&quot;. He left &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Compendium&quot;), a synthesis of Epicurean doctrines, unfinished at the time of his death in 1655. It was finally published in 1658, after undergoing revision by his editors. Gassendi modified Epicurus&#x27;s teachings to make them palatable for a Christian audience. For instance, he argued that atoms were not eternal, uncreated, and infinite in number, instead contending that an extremely large but finite number of atoms were created by God at creation.

As a result of Gassendi&#x27;s modifications, his books were never censored by the Catholic Church. They came to exert profound influence on later writings about Epicurus. Gassendi&#x27;s version of Epicurus&#x27;s teachings became popular among some members of English scientific circles. For these scholars, however, Epicurean atomism was merely a starting point for their own idiosyncratic adaptations of it. To orthodox thinkers, Epicureanism was still regarded as immoral and heretical. For instance, Lucy Hutchinson (1620–1681), the first translator of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; into English, railed against Epicurus as &quot;a lunatic dog&quot; who formulated &quot;ridiculous, impious, execrable doctrines&quot;.

Epicurus&#x27;s teachings were made respectable in England by the natural philosopher Walter Charleton (1619–1707), whose first Epicurean work, &quot;The Darkness of Atheism Dispelled by the Light of Nature&quot; (1652), advanced Epicureanism as a &quot;new&quot; atomism. His next work &quot;Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charletoniana, or a Fabrick of Science Natural, upon a Hypothesis of Atoms, Founded by Epicurus, Repaired by Petrus Gassendus, and Augmented by Walter Charleton&quot; (1654) emphasized this idea. These works, together with Charleton&#x27;s &quot;Epicurus&#x27;s Morals&quot; (1658), provided the English public with readily available descriptions of Epicurus&#x27;s philosophy and assured orthodox Christians that Epicureanism was no threat to their beliefs. The Royal Society, chartered in 1662, advanced Epicurean atomism. One of the most prolific defenders of atomism was the chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who argued for it in publications such as &quot;The Origins of Forms and Qualities&quot; (1666), &quot;Experiments, Notes, etc. about the Mechanical Origin and Production of Divers Particular Qualities&quot; (1675), and &quot;Of the Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis&quot; (1674). By the end of the seventeenth century, Epicurean atomism was widely accepted by members of the English scientific community as the best model for explaining the physical world, but it had been modified so greatly that Epicurus was no longer seen as its original parent.

===Enlightenment and after===
The Anglican bishop Joseph Butler&#x27;s anti-Epicurean polemics in his &quot;Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel&quot; (1726) and &quot;Analogy of Religion&quot; (1736) set the tune for what most orthodox Christians believed about Epicureanism for the remainder of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nonetheless, there are a few indications from this time period of Epicurus&#x27;s improving reputation. Epicureanism was beginning to lose its associations with indiscriminate and insatiable gluttony, which had been characteristic of its reputation ever since antiquity. Instead, the word &quot;epicure&quot; began to refer to a person with extremely refined taste in food. Examples of this usage include &quot;Epicurean cooks / sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite&quot; from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (Act II. scene i; 1607) and &quot;such an epicure was Potiphar—to please his tooth and pamper his flesh with delicacies&quot; from William Whately&#x27;s &quot;Prototypes&quot; (1646).

Around the same time, the Epicurean injunction to &quot;live in obscurity&quot; was beginning to gain popularity as well. In 1685, Sir William Temple (1628–1699) abandoned a promising career as a diplomat and instead retired to his garden, devoting himself to writing essays on Epicurus&#x27;s moral teachings. That same year, John Dryden translated the celebrated lines from Book II of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Tis pleasant, safely to behold from shore / The rowling ship, and hear the Tempest roar.&quot; Meanwhile, John Locke (1632–1704) adapted Gassendi&#x27;s modified version of Epicurus&#x27;s epistemology, which became highly influential on English empiricism. Many thinkers with sympathies towards the Enlightenment endorsed Epicureanism as an admirable moral philosophy. Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, declared in 1819, &quot;I too am an Epicurean. I consider the genuine (not imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing everything rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us.&quot;

The German philosopher Karl Marx (1818–1883), whose ideas are the basis of Marxism, was profoundly influenced as a young man by the teachings of Epicurus and his doctoral thesis was a Hegelian dialectical analysis of the differences between the natural philosophies of Democritus and Epicurus. Marx viewed Democritus as a rationalist skeptic, whose epistemology was inherently contradictory, but saw Epicurus as a dogmatic empiricist, whose worldview is internally consistent and practically applicable. The British poet Alfred Tennyson (1809–1892) praised &quot;the sober majesties / of settled, sweet, Epicurean life&quot; in his 1868 poem &quot;Lucretius&quot;. Epicurus&#x27;s ethical teachings also had an indirect impact on the philosophy of Utilitarianism in England during the nineteenth century. Soviet politician Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) lauded Epicurus by stating: &quot;He was the greatest philosopher of all time. He was the one who recommended practicing virtue to derive the greatest joy from life&quot;.

Friedrich Nietzsche once noted: &quot;Even today many educated people think that the victory of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superior truth of the former – although in this case it was only the coarser and more violent that conquered the more spiritual and delicate. So far as superior truth is concerned, it is enough to observe that the awakening sciences have allied themselves point by point with the philosophy of Epicurus, but point by point rejected Christianity.&quot;

Academic interest in Epicurus and other Hellenistic philosophers increased over the course of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, with an unprecedented number of monographs, articles, abstracts, and conference papers being published on the subject. The texts from the library of Philodemus of Gadara in the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, first discovered between 1750 and 1765, are being deciphered, translated, and published by scholars part of the Philodemus Translation Project, funded by the United States National Endowment for the Humanities, and part of the Centro per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi in Naples. Epicurus&#x27;s popular appeal among non-scholars is difficult to gauge, but it seems to be relatively comparable to the appeal of more traditionally popular ancient Greek philosophical subjects such as Stoicism, Aristotle, and Plato.

<doc id="10074" wikidata="Q1772" url="?curid=10074" title="Epitaph">
<text>An epitaph (; ) is a short text honoring a deceased person. Strictly speaking, it refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone or plaque, but it may also be used in a figurative sense. Some epitaphs are specified by the person themselves before their death, while others are chosen by those responsible for the burial. An epitaph may be written in prose or in poem verse.

Most epitaphs are brief records of the family, and perhaps the career, of the deceased, often with a common expression of love or respect—for example, &quot;beloved father of ...&quot;—but others are more ambitious. From the Renaissance to the 19th century in Western culture, epitaphs for notable people became increasingly lengthy and pompous descriptions of their family origins, career, virtues and immediate family, often in Latin. Notably, the Laudatio Turiae, the longest known Ancient Roman epitaph, exceeds almost all of these at 180 lines; it celebrates the virtues of an honored wife (sometimes identified, but not generally accepted, as the Wife of consul Quintus Lucretius Vespillo).

Some are quotes from holy texts, or aphorisms. One approach of many epitaphs is to &quot;speak&quot; to the reader and warn them about their own mortality. A wry trick of others is to request the reader to get off their resting place, inasmuch as the reader would have to be standing on the ground above the coffin to read the inscription. Some record achievements (e.g., past politicians note the years of their terms of office). Nearly all (excepting those where this is impossible by definition, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier) note name, year or date of birth, and date of death. Many list family members and the relationship of the deceased to them (for example, &quot;Father / Mother / Son / Daughter of&quot;).

==Linguistic distinctions==
In English, and in accordance with the word&#x27;s etymology, the word &quot;epitaph&quot; refers to a &quot;textual&quot; commemoration of a person, which may or may not be inscribed on a monument. In many European languages, however, the meaning of the word (or its close equivalent) has broadened to mean the monument itself, specifically a mural monument or plaque erected in a church, often close to, but not directly over, a person&#x27;s place of burial. Examples include German &quot;Epitaph&quot;; Dutch &quot;epitaaf&quot;; Hungarian &quot;epitáfium&quot;; Polish &quot;epitafium&quot;; Danish &quot;epitafium&quot;; Swedish &quot;epitafium&quot;; and Estonian &quot;epitaaf&quot;.

== History ==
The history of epitaphs extends as far back as the ancient Egyptians and have differed in delivery. The ancient Greeks utilised emotive expression, written in elegiac verse, later in prose. Ancient Romans&#x27; use of epitaphs was more blunt and uniform, typically detailing facts of the deceased – as did the earliest epitaphs in English churches. &quot;May the earth lie light upon thee&quot; was a common inscription for them. Due to the influence of Roman occupiers, the dominant language of epitaphs was Latin, evidenced by the oldest existing epitaphs in Britain. French and English came into fashion around the 13th and 14th centuries, respectively.

By the 16th century, epitaphs had become more literary in nature and those written in verse were involved in trade. In America and Britain, comedic epitaphs are common in the form of acrostics, palindromes, riddles, and puns on names and professions – Robert Burns, the most prolific pre-Romantic epitaphist, wrote 35 pieces, them being largely satirical. The rate of literary epitaphs has been historically overshadowed by &quot;popular sepulchral inscriptions which are produced in countless numbers at all time&quot;; &quot;strictly literary&quot; epitaphs were most present during the start of the Romantic period.

The Lake Poets have been credited with providing success to epitaph-writing adjacent to that of poetry significance – Robert Southey, in focusing simultaneously upon transience and eternity, contributed substantially. General interest for epitaphs was waning at the cusp of the 19th century, in contrast to a considerable burgeoning intellectual interest. Critical essays had been published before on the matter, possibly contributing towards its flourishing in the latter half of the 18th century. Epitaphs never became a major poetic form and, according to Romantic scholar Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch, they had &quot;virtually disappeared&quot; by 1810. &quot;The art of the epitaph was largely lost in the 20th century&quot;, wrote the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;.

=== Format ===
Sarcophagi and coffins were the choice of ancient Egyptians for epitaphs; brasses was the prominent format for a significant period of time. Epitaphs upon stone monuments became a common feature by the Elizabethan era.

==In England==

===Medieval era===

Stock phrases or standard elements present in epitaphs on mediaeval church monuments and ledger stones in England include:
*&quot;Hic jacet..&quot; (here lies...)
*&quot;... cuius animae propitietur deus amen&quot; (generally abbreviated to &quot;cuius aie ppitiet ds ame&quot; with tildes indicating the omitted letters) (&quot;whose soul may God look upon with favour Amen&quot;)
*&quot;Memoriae sacrum ...&quot; / &quot;MS&quot; (&quot;Sacred to the memory (of) ...&quot;)

===Modern era===
*&quot;Requiescat in pace&quot; / &quot;RIP&quot; (&quot;may he rest in peace&quot;)

== Notable examples ==

=== Statesmen ===
=== Mathematicians ===

==In music==
In a more figurative sense, the term may be used for music composed in memory of the deceased. Igor Stravinsky composed in 1958 &quot;Epitaphium&quot; for flute, clarinet and harp. In 1967 Krzysztof Meyer called his Symphony No. 2 for choir and orchestra &quot;Epitaphium Stanisław Wiechowicz in memoriam&quot;. Jeffrey Lewis composed &quot;Epitaphium – Children of the Sun&quot; for narrator, chamber choir, piano, flute, clarinet and percussion. In 1969, King Crimson released the song Epitaph, giving a reference to epitaphs within the song. Bronius Kutavičius composed in 1998 &quot;Epitaphium temporum pereunti&quot;. Valentin Silvestrov composed in 1999 &quot;Epitaph L.B.&quot; (Епітафія Л.Б.) for viola (or cello) and piano. In 2007 Graham Waterhouse composed &quot;Epitaphium&quot; for string trio as a tribute to the memory of his father William Waterhouse. The South African poet Gert Vlok Nel wrote an (originally) untitled song, which appeared on his first music album &quot;Beaufort-Wes se Beautiful Woorde&quot; as &quot;Epitaph&quot;, because his producer Eckard Potgieter told him that the song sounded like an epitaph. David Bowie&#x27;s final album, &quot;Blackstar&quot;, released in 2016, is generally seen as his musical epitaph, with singles &quot;Blackstar&quot; and &quot;Lazarus&quot; often singled out.

<doc id="10075" wikidata="Q193121" url="?curid=10075" title="Epigram">
<text>An epigram is a brief, interesting, memorable, sometimes surprising or satirical statement. The word derives from the Greek (, &quot;inscription&quot;, from [], &quot;to write on, to inscribe&quot;). This literary device has been practiced for over two millennia.

The presence of wit or sarcasm tends to distinguish non-poetic epigrams from aphorisms and adages, which typically do not show those qualities.

==Ancient Greek==
The Greek tradition of epigrams began as poems inscribed on votive offerings at sanctuariesincluding statues of athletesand on funerary monuments, for example &quot;Go tell it to the Spartans, passersby...&quot;. These original epigrams did the same job as a short prose text might have done, but in verse. Epigram became a literary genre in the Hellenistic period, probably developing out of scholarly collections of inscriptional epigrams.

Though modern epigrams are usually thought of as very short, Greek literary epigram was not always as short as later examples, and the divide between &quot;epigram&quot; and &quot;elegy&quot; is sometimes indistinct (they share a characteristic metre, elegiac couplets). In the classical period, the clear distinction between them was that epigrams were inscribed and meant to be read, while elegies were recited and meant to be heard. Some elegies could be quite short, but only public epigrams were longer than ten lines. All the same, the origin of epigram in inscription exerted a residual pressure to keep things concise, even when they were recited in Hellenistic times. Many of the characteristic types of literary epigram look back to inscriptional contexts, particularly funerary epigram, which in the Hellenistic era becomes a literary exercise. Many &quot;sympotic&quot; epigrams combine sympotic and funerary elementsthey tell their readers (or listeners) to drink and live for today because life is short. Generally, any theme found in classical elegies could be and were adapted for later literary epigrams.

Hellenistic epigrams are also thought of as having a &quot;point&quot;that is, the poem ends in a punchline or satirical twist. By no means do all Greek epigrams behave this way; many are simply descriptive, but Meleager of Gadara and Philippus of Thessalonica, the first comprehensive anthologists, preferred the short and witty epigram. Since their collections helped form knowledge of the genre in Rome and then later throughout Europe, Epigram came to be associated with &#x27;point&#x27;, especially because the European epigram tradition takes the Latin poet Martial as its principal model; he copied and adapted Greek models (particularly the contemporary poets Lucillius and Nicarchus) selectively and in the process redefined the genre, aligning it with the indigenous Roman tradition of &quot;satura&quot;, hexameter satire, as practised by (among others) his contemporary Juvenal. Greek epigram was actually much more diverse, as the Milan Papyrus now indicates.

A major source for Greek literary epigram is the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, a compilation from the 10th century AD based on older collections, including those of Meleager and Philippus. It contains epigrams ranging from the Hellenistic period through the Imperial period and Late Antiquity into the compiler&#x27;s own Byzantine eraa thousand years of short elegiac texts on every topic under the sun. The &quot;Anthology&quot; includes one book of Christian epigrams as well as one book of erotic and amorous homosexual epigrams called the (, &quot;The Boyish Muse&quot;).

==Ancient Roman==
Roman epigrams owe much to their Greek predecessors and contemporaries. Roman epigrams, however, were often more satirical than Greek ones, and at times used obscene language for effect. Latin epigrams could be composed as inscriptions or graffiti, such as this one from Pompeii, which exists in several versions and seems from its inexact meter to have been composed by a less educated person. Its content makes it clear how popular such poems were:

However, in the literary world, epigrams were most often gifts to patrons or entertaining verse to be published, not inscriptions. Many Roman writers seem to have composed epigrams, including Domitius Marsus, whose collection &quot;Cicuta&quot; (now lost) was named after the poisonous plant &quot;Cicuta&quot; for its biting wit, and Lucan, more famous for his epic &quot;Pharsalia&quot;. Authors whose epigrams survive include Catullus, who wrote both invectives and love epigrams – his poem 85 is one of the latter.

Martial, however, is considered to be the master of the Latin epigram. His technique relies heavily on the satirical poem with a joke in the last line, thus drawing him closer to the modern idea of epigram as a genre. Here he defines his genre against a (probably fictional) critic (in the latter half of 2.77):

Poets known for their epigrams whose work has been lost include Cornificia.

==English==
In early English literature the short couplet poem was dominated by the poetic epigram and proverb, especially in the translations of the Bible and the Greek and Roman poets.

Two successive lines of verse that rhyme with each other are known as a couplet. Since 1600, the couplet has been featured as a part of the longer sonnet form, most notably in William Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. Sonnet 76 is an example. The two-line poetic form as a closed couplet was also used by William Blake in his poem &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot;, and also by Byron in his poem &quot;Don Juan&quot;, by John Gay in his fables, and by Alexander Pope in his &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;.

The first work of English literature penned in North America was Robert Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Quodlibets, Lately Come Over from New Britaniola, Old Newfoundland&quot;, which is a collection of over 300 epigrams, many of which do not conform to the two-line rule or trend. While the collection was written between 1618 and 1628 in what is now Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, it was published shortly after his return to Britain. 
In Victorian times the epigram couplet was often used by the prolific American poet Emily Dickinson. Her poem No. 1534 is a typical example of her eleven poetic epigrams. The novelist George Eliot also included couplets throughout her writings. Her best example is in her sequenced sonnet poem entitled &quot;Brother and Sister&quot; in which each of the eleven sequenced sonnet ends with a couplet. In her sonnets, the preceding lead-in-line, to the couplet ending of each, could be thought of as a title for the couplet, as is shown in Sonnet VIII of the sequence.

During the early 20th century, the rhymed epigram couplet form developed into a fixed verse image form, with an integral title as the third line. Adelaide Crapsey codified the couplet form into a two-line rhymed verse of ten syllables per line with her image couplet poem &quot;On Seeing Weather-Beaten Trees&quot;, first published in 1915.

By the 1930s, the five-line cinquain verse form became widely known in the poetry of the Scottish poet William Soutar. These were originally labelled epigrams but later identified as image cinquains in the style of Adelaide Crapsey.

J. V. Cunningham was also a noted writer of epigrams (a medium suited to a &quot;short-breathed&quot; person).

==Poetic epigrams==
:What is an Epigram? a dwarfish whole,
:Its body brevity, and wit its soul. 
:— Samuel Taylor Coleridge (&quot;Epigram&quot;, 1809)

:Some can gaze and not be sick
:But I could never learn the trick.
:There&#x27;s this to say for blood and breath;
:They give a man a taste for death.
:— A. E. Housman

:Little strokes
:Fell great oaks.
:— Benjamin Franklin

:Here lies my wife: here let her lie!
:Now she&#x27;s at restand so am I.
:— John Dryden

:Three Poets, in three distant Ages born,

<doc id="10076" wikidata="Q43958" url="?curid=10076" title="El Cid">
<text>Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar ( – 10 July 1099) was a Castilian knight and ruler in medieval Spain. Fighting both with Christian and Muslim armies during his lifetime, he earned the Arabic honorific (&quot;the Lord&quot; or &quot;the Master&quot;), which would evolve into El Çid (, ), and the Spanish honorific El Campeador (&quot;the Champion&quot;). He was born in Vivar, a village near the city of Burgos.

As the head of his loyal knights, he came to dominate the Levante of the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the 11th century. He reclaimed the Taifa of Valencia from Moorish control for a brief period during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, ruling the Principality of Valencia from 17 June 1094 until his death in 1099. His wife, Jimena Díaz, inherited the city and maintained it until 1102 when it was reconquered by the Moors.

Díaz de Vivar became well known for his service in the armies of both Christian and Muslim rulers. After his death, El Cid became Spain&#x27;s most celebrated national hero and the protagonist of the most significant medieval Spanish epic poem, , which presents him as the ideal medieval knight: strong, valiant, loyal, just, and pious.

There are various theories on his family history, which remains uncertain; however, he was the grandfather of García Ramírez de Pamplona, King of Navarre, the first son of his daughter Cristina Rodríguez. To this day, El Cid remains a popular Spanish folk hero and national icon, with his life and deeds remembered in popular culture.

== Etymology: &quot;Cid&quot; and &quot;Campeador&quot; ==

Rodrigo Díaz was recognized with the honorary title &quot;Campeador&quot; during his lifetime, as is evidenced by a document that he signed in 1098, which he signed in the Latinized expression, . The title &quot;Campeador&quot; comes from the Latin , literally meaning &quot;Teacher of the Field&quot;, but translatable as &quot;Master of the Battlefield&quot;. Arabic sources from the late 11th century and early 12th century call him (), (), also preceded by or , which are Arabized forms of his title and name, respectively.

The epithet &quot;El Cid&quot; meant &quot;the Lord&quot;, probably from the original Arabic (), and was a title given to other Christian leaders. It has been conjectured that Rodrigo Díaz received the honorific title and respectful treatment of contemporaries in Zaragoza because of his victories in the service of the King of the Taifa of Zaragoza between 1081 and 1086; however, he more likely received the epithet after his conquest of Valencia in 1094. This title appears for the first time, as , in the , composed between 1147 and 1149.

The combination of &quot;Cid Campeador&quot; is documented from 1195 in (&quot;The Lineage of Rodrigo Díaz&quot;) in Navarro-Aragonese which form part of the written as ; and in .

== Summary ==
Born a member of the minor nobility, El Cid was brought up at the court of Ferdinand the Great and served Ferdinand&#x27;s son, Sancho II of León and Castile. He rose to become the commander and royal standard-bearer (&quot;armiger regis&quot;) of Castile upon Sancho&#x27;s ascension in 1065. El Cid went on to lead the Castilian military campaigns against Sancho&#x27;s brothers, Alfonso VI of León and García II of Galicia, as well as in the Muslim kingdoms in al-Andalus. He became renowned for his military prowess in these campaigns, which helped expand the territory of the Crown of Castile at the expense of the Muslims and Sancho&#x27;s brothers&#x27; kingdoms.

When conspirators murdered Sancho in 1072, El Cid found himself in a difficult situation. Since Sancho was childless, the throne passed to his brother Alfonso, whom El Cid had helped remove from power. Although El Cid continued to serve the sovereign, he lost his ranking in the new court, which treated him suspiciously and kept him at arm&#x27;s length. Finally, in 1081, he was exiled.

El Cid found work fighting for the Muslim rulers of Zaragoza, whom he defended from its traditional enemy, Aragon. While in exile, he regained his reputation as a strategist and formidable military leader. He was repeatedly victorious in battle against the Muslim rulers of Lérida and their Christian allies, as well as against a large Christian army under King Sancho Ramírez of Aragon. In 1086, an expeditionary army of North African Almoravids inflicted a severe defeat to Castile, compelling Alfonso to overcome the resentment he harboured against El Cid. The terms for El Cid&#x27;s return to Christian service must have been attractive enough since El Cid soon found himself fighting for his former lord. Over the next several years, however, El Cid set his sights on the kingdom-city of Valencia, operating more or less independently of Alfonso, while politically supporting the Banu Hud and other Muslim dynasties opposed to the Almoravids. He gradually increased his control over Valencia; the Islamic ruler, Yahya al-Qadir, became his tributary in 1092. When the Almoravids instigated an uprising that resulted in the death of al-Qadir, El Cid responded by laying siege to the city. Valencia finally fell in 1094, and El Cid established an independent principality on the Mediterranean coast of Iberia. He ruled over a pluralistic society with the popular support of Christians and Muslims alike.

El Cid&#x27;s final years were spent fighting the Almoravid Berbers. He inflicted upon them their first major defeat in 1094, on the plains of Caurte, outside Valencia, and continued opposing them until his death. Although El Cid remained undefeated in Valencia, Diego Rodríguez, his only son and heir, died fighting against the Almoravids in the service of Alfonso in 1097. After El Cid&#x27;s death in 1099, his wife, Jimena Díaz, succeeded him as ruler of Valencia, but she was eventually forced to surrender the principality to the Almoravids in 1102.

==Title==
The name &quot;El Cid&quot; () is a modern Spanish denomination composed of the article &quot;el&quot; meaning &quot;the&quot; and &quot;Cid&quot;, which derives from the Old Castilian loan word &quot;Çid&quot; borrowed from the dialectal Arabic word سيد &quot;sîdi&quot; or sayyid, which means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. The Mozarabs or the Arabs that served in his ranks may have addressed him in this way, which the Christians may have transliterated and adopted. Historians, however, have not yet found contemporary records referring to Rodrigo as &quot;Cid.&quot; Arab sources use instead &quot;Rudriq&quot;, &quot;Ludriq al-Kanbiyatur&quot; or &quot;al-Qanbiyatur&quot; (&quot;Rodrigo el Campeador&quot;).

The cognomen &quot;Campeador&quot; derives from Latin &quot;campi doctor,&quot; which means &quot;battlefield master&quot;. He probably gained it during the campaigns of King Sancho II of Castile against his brothers, kings Alfonso VI of León and García II of Galicia. While his contemporaries left no historical sources that would have addressed him as &quot;Cid&quot;, they left plenty of Christian and Arab records, some even signed documents with his autograph, addressing him as &quot;Campeador&quot;, which prove that he used the Christian cognomen himself. The whole combination &quot;Cid Campeador&quot; is first documented c. 1195 in the Navarro-Aragonese &quot;&quot; included in the &quot;Liber Regum&quot; under the formula &quot;mio Cid el Campeador&quot;.

==Life and career==

===Origins===
El Cid was born Rodrigo Díaz circa 1043 in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar, a small town about ten kilometers (or six miles) north of Burgos, the capital of Castile. His father, Diego Laínez, was a courtier, bureaucrat, and cavalryman who had fought in several battles. Despite the fact that El Cid&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family was aristocratic, in later years, the peasants would consider him one of their own. However, his relatives were not major court officials; documents show that El Cid&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Laín, confirmed only five documents of Ferdinand I&#x27;s; his maternal grandfather, Rodrigo Álvarez, certified only two of Sancho II&#x27;s; and El Cid&#x27;s father confirmed only one.

===Service under Sancho II===
As a young man in 1057, El Cid fought against the Moorish stronghold of Zaragoza, making its emir al-Muqtadir a vassal of Sancho. In the spring of 1063, El Cid fought in the Battle of Graus, where Ferdinand&#x27;s half-brother, Ramiro I of Aragon, was laying siege to the Moorish town of Graus, which was fought on Zaragozan lands in the valley of the river Cinca. Al-Muqtadir, accompanied by Castilian troops including El Cid, fought against the Aragonese. The party slew Ramiro I, setting the Aragonese army on the run, and emerged victorious. One legend has said that during the conflict, El Cid killed an Aragonese knight in single combat, thereby receiving the honorific title &quot;Campeador&quot;.

When Ferdinand died, Sancho continued to enlarge his territory, conquering both Christian strongholds and the Moorish cities of Zamora and Badajoz. When Sancho learned that Alfonso was planning on overthrowing him in order to gain his territory, Sancho sent Cid to bring Alfonso back so that Sancho could speak to him.

===Service under Alfonso VI===
Sancho was assassinated in 1072, during a siege of his sister&#x27;s town of Zamora. Since Sancho died unmarried and childless, all of his power passed to his brother Alfonso who, almost immediately, returned from exile in Toledo and took his seat as king of Castile and León. He was, however, deeply suspected of having been involved in Sancho&#x27;s murder. According to the 11th century epic poem &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot;, the Castilian nobility led by El Cid and a dozen &quot;oath-helpers&quot; forced Alfonso to swear publicly on holy relics multiple times in front of Santa Gadea (Saint Agatha) Church in Burgos that he did not participate in the plot to kill his brother. This is not mentioned in the more reliable 12th century chronicle &quot;Historia Roderici&quot;, however. El Cid&#x27;s position as &quot;armiger regis&quot; was taken away and given to his enemy, Count García Ordóñez.

In 1079, El Cid was sent by Alfonso VI to Seville to the court of al-Mutamid to collect the &quot;parias&quot; owed by that &quot;taifa&quot; to León–Castile. While he was there Granada, assisted by other Castilian knights, attacked Seville, and El Cid and his forces repulsed the Christian and Grenadine attackers at the Battle of Cabra, in the (probably mistaken) belief that he was defending the king&#x27;s tributary. During the aftermath of this battle the Muslim troops under El Cid&#x27;s command would hail him as Sayyidi. Count García Ordóñez and the other Castilian leaders were taken captive and held for three days before being released.

===Exile===
In the Battle of Cabra (1079), El Cid rallied his troops and turned the battle into a rout of Emir Abdullah of Granada and his ally García Ordóñez. This unauthorized expedition into Granada, however, greatly angered Alfonso and May 8, 1080, was the last time El Cid confirmed a document in King Alfonso&#x27;s court. The most likely reason was El Cid&#x27;s incursion into Toledo, which happened to be under the control of Alfonso&#x27;s vassal, Yahya Al-Qadir. Alfonso&#x27;s anger over El Cid&#x27;s unsanctioned incursion into his vassal&#x27;s territory would lead him to exile the knight.
This is the generally accepted reason for the exile of El Cid, although several others are plausible and indeed may have been contributing factors to the exile: jealous nobles turning Alfonso against El Cid through court intrigue, and Alfonso&#x27;s own personal animosity towards El Cid. The song of El Cid and subsequent tales state that Alfonso&#x27;s and his court&#x27;s animosity toward Rodrigo was the primary reason the expulsion of the knights from León, as well as a possible misappropriation of some of the tribute from Seville by El Cid.

At first he went to Barcelona, where Ramon Berenguer II refused his offer of service.

==Moorish service==

The exile was not the end of El Cid, either physically or as an important figure. After being rejected by Ramon Berenguer II, El Cid journeyed to the Taifa of Zaragoza, where he received a warmer welcome. In 1081, El Cid went on to offer his services to the king of Zaragoza, Yusuf al-Mu&#x27;taman ibn Hud, and served both him and his successor, al-Musta&#x27;in II. He was given the title &quot;El Cid&quot; (&quot;The Master&quot;) and served as a leading figure in a diverse Moorish force consisting of Muwallads, Berbers, Arabs, and Malians within the respective Taifa.

According to Moorish accounts:

In his &quot;History of Medieval Spain&quot; (Cornell University Press, 1975), Joseph F. O&#x27;Callaghan writes:

In 1082, the army of the Taifa of Zaragoza under El Cid defeated the Taifa of Lleida at the Battle of Almenar. In 1084, he defeated the Aragonese at the Battle of Morella near Tortosa, but in autumn the Castilians started a loose siege of Toledo and later the next year the Christians captured Salamanca, a stronghold of the Taifa of Toledo.

In 1086, the Almoravid invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, through and around Gibraltar, began. The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty from North Africa, led by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, were asked to help defend the divided Moors from Alfonso. The Almoravid army, joined by that of several Taifas, including Badajoz, Málaga, Granada, Tortosa and Seville, defeated a combined army of León, Aragón, and Castile at the Battle of Sagrajas.

In 1087, Raymond of Burgundy and his Christian allies attempted to weaken the Taifa of Zaragoza&#x27;s northernmost stronghold by initiating the Siege of Tudela and Alfonso captured Aledo, Murcia, blocking the route between the Taifas in the eastern and western Iberian Peninsula.

==Recall from exile==

Terrified after his crushing defeat, Alfonso recalled El Cid, rewarding him lavishly with lands and lordships, such as the fortress of Gormaz. In the year 1087 Alfonso sent him to negotiate with the emboldened Taifa kingdoms.

El Cid returned to Alfonso, but now he had his own plans. He only stayed a short while and then returned to Zaragoza. El Cid was content to let the Almoravid armies and the armies of Alfonso fight without his help, even when there was a chance that the Almoravids might defeat Alfonso and take over all of Alfonso&#x27;s lands. El Cid chose not to fight because he was hoping that both armies would weaken themselves. 

===Conquest of Valencia===
Around this time, El Cid, with a combined Christian and Moorish army, began maneuvering in order to create his own fief in the Moorish Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia. Several obstacles lay in his way. First was Berenguer Ramon II, who ruled nearby Barcelona. In May 1090, El Cid defeated and captured Berenguer in the Battle of Tébar (nowadays Pinar de Tévar, near Monroyo, Teruel). Berenguer was later released and his nephew Ramon Berenguer III married El Cid&#x27;s youngest daughter Maria to ward against future conflicts.

Along the way to Valencia, El Cid also conquered other towns, many of which were near Valencia, such as El Puig and Quart de Poblet.

El Cid gradually came to have more influence in Valencia, then ruled by Yahya al-Qadir, of the Hawwara Berber Dhulnunid dynasty. In October 1092 an uprising occurred in Valencia, inspired by the city&#x27;s chief judge Ibn Jahhaf and the Almoravids. El Cid began a siege of Valencia. A December 1093 attempt to break the siege failed. By the time the siege ended in May 1094, El Cid had carved out his own principality on the coast of the Mediterranean. Officially, El Cid ruled in the name of Alfonso; in practice, El Cid was fully independent. The city was both Christian and Muslim, and both Moors and Christians served in the army and as administrators. Jerome of Périgord was made bishop.

===Death===
El Cid and his wife Jimena Díaz lived peacefully in Valencia until the Almoravids besieged the city. 
But he defeated them and died 5 years later, on July 10, 1099.

Afterward Valencia was captured by Mazdali on May 5, 1102. Jimena fled to Burgos, Castile, in 1101. She rode into the town with her retinue and the body of El Cid. Originally buried in Castile in the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña, his body now lies at the center of Burgos Cathedral.

===Legend of posthumous victory===
After his demise, but still during the siege of Valencia, legend holds that Jimena ordered that the corpse of El Cid be fitted with his armor and set on his horse, Babieca, to bolster the morale of his troops. In several variations of the story, the dead Rodrigo and his knights win a thundering charge against Valencia&#x27;s besiegers, resulting in a war-is-lost-but-battle-is-won catharsis for generations of Christian Spaniards to follow. It is believed that the legend originated shortly after Jimena entered Burgos, and that it is derived from the manner in which Jimena&#x27;s procession rode into the city, i.e. alongside her deceased husband.

==Warrior and general==

===Battle tactics===
During his campaigns, El Cid often ordered that books by classic Roman and Greek authors on military themes be read aloud to him and his troops, for both entertainment and inspiration before battle. El Cid&#x27;s army had a novel approach to planning strategy as well, holding what might be called &quot;brainstorming&quot; sessions before each battle to discuss tactics. They frequently used unexpected strategies, engaging in what modern generals would call psychological warfare—waiting for the enemy to be paralyzed with terror and then attacking them suddenly; distracting the enemy with a small group of soldiers, etc. (El Cid used this distraction in capturing the town of Castejón as depicted in &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot; (&quot;The Song of my Cid&quot;).) El Cid accepted or included suggestions from his troops. In &quot;The Song&quot; the man who served him as his closest adviser was his vassal and kinsman Álvar Fáñez &quot;Minaya&quot; (meaning &quot;My brother&quot;, a compound word of Spanish possessive &quot;Mi&quot; (My) and &quot;Anaia&quot;, the basque word for &quot;brother&quot;), although the historical Álvar Fáñez remained in Castile with Alfonso VI.

===Babieca===
Babieca, or Bavieca, was El Cid&#x27;s warhorse. Several stories exist about El Cid and Babieca. One well-known legend about El Cid describes how he acquired the stallion. According to this story, Rodrigo&#x27;s godfather, Pedro El Grande, was a monk at a Carthusian monastery. Pedro&#x27;s coming-of-age gift to El Cid was his pick of a horse from an Andalusian herd. El Cid picked a horse that his godfather thought was a weak, poor choice, causing the monk to exclaim &quot;Babieca!&quot; (stupid!). Hence, it became the name of El Cid&#x27;s horse. Another legend states that in a competition of battle to become King Sancho&#x27;s &quot;Campeador&quot;, or champion, a knight on horseback wished to challenge El Cid. The King wished a fair fight and gave El Cid his finest horse, Babieca, or Bavieca. This version says Babieca was raised in the royal stables of Seville and was a highly trained and loyal war horse, not a foolish stallion. The name in this instance could suggest that the horse came from the Babia region in León, Spain. In the poem &quot;Carmen Campidoctoris&quot;, Babieca appears as a gift from &quot;a barbarian&quot; to El Cid, so its name could also be derived from &quot;Barbieca&quot;, or &quot;horse of the barbarian&quot;.

Regardless, Babieca became a great warhorse, famous to the Christians, feared by El Cid&#x27;s enemies, and loved by El Cid, who allegedly requested that Babieca be buried with him in the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña. Babieca is mentioned in several tales and historical documents about El Cid, including &quot;The Lay of El Cid&quot;.

===Swords===
A weapon traditionally identified as El Cid&#x27;s sword, Tizona, used to be displayed in the Army Museum (Museo del Ejército) in Toledo. In 1999, a small sample of the blade underwent metallurgical analysis which confirmed that the blade was made in Moorish Córdoba in the eleventh century and contained amounts of Damascus steel.

In 2007, the Autonomous Community of Castile and León bought the sword for €1.6 million, and it is currently on display at the Museum of Burgos.

El Cid also had a sword called Colada.

==Wife and children==
El Cid married Jimena Díaz, who was said to be part of an aristocratic family from Asturias, in the mid-1070s. The &quot;Historia Roderici&quot; calls her a daughter of a Count Diego Fernández de Oviedo. Tradition states that when El Cid first laid eyes on her, he was enamoured of her great beauty. El Cid and Jimena had two daughters, Cristina and María, and a son. The latter, Diego Rodríguez, was killed while fighting against the invading Muslim Almoravids from North Africa at the Battle of Consuegra in 1097. El Cid&#x27;s daughters Cristina Rodríguez and María both married into noble families. Cristina married Ramiro, Lord of Monzón and grandson of García Sánchez III of Navarre.

Her own son, El Cid&#x27;s grandson, would be elevated to the throne of Navarre as King García Ramírez. The other daughter, María (also known as Sol), is said first to have married a prince of Aragon, presumably the son of Peter I, and she later married Ramon Berenguer III, count of Barcelona. Both the poem and the chronicle may state a previous marriage to the ; however, these marriages are not a historical fact and are an important element in the construction of the poem.

==In literature, music, video games, and film==
The figure of El Cid has been the source for many literary works, beginning with the &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot;, an epic poem from the 12th century which gives a partly-fictionalized account of his life, and was one of the early chivalric romances. This poem, along with similar later works such as the &quot;Mocedades de Rodrigo&quot;, contributed to portray El Cid as a chivalric hero of the Reconquista, making him a legendary figure in Spain. El Cid is one of the few examples of knight errantry formally recognized by the priest in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605–1615).

In the early 17th century, the Spanish writer Guillén de Castro wrote a play called &quot;Las Mocedades del Cid&quot;, on which French playwright Pierre Corneille based one of his most famous tragicomedies, &quot;Le Cid&quot;. He was also a popular source of inspiration for Spanish writers of the Romantic period, such as Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch, who wrote &quot;La Jura de Santa Gadea&quot;, or José Zorrilla, who wrote a long poem called &quot;La Leyenda del Cid&quot;. In 2019, Arturo Pérez-Reverte published the novel entitled &quot;Sidi: Un relato de frontera&quot;.

Herman Melville references El Cid when introducing the character of Samoa in Chapter 21 of &quot;Mardi&quot; (1849): &quot;He alighted about six paces from where we stood, and balancing his weapon, eyed us bravely as the Cid&quot;.

In 1929, Chilean writer Vicente Huidobro published his poetic novel &quot;Mío Cid Campeador. Hazaña.&quot; This work, together with other novels (and plays) he published between 1929 and 1939, defied the traditional realistic style of the early 20th century Chilean novel. The English version was published in 1931.

Georges Bizet worked on &quot;Don Rodrigue&quot; in 1873 that was set aside and never completed. Jules Massenet wrote an opera, &quot;Le Cid&quot;, in 1885, based on Corneille&#x27;s play of the same name. Claude Debussy began work in 1890 on an opera, &quot;Rodrigue et Chimène&quot;, which he abandoned as unsuitable for his temperament; it was orchestrated for performance by Edison Denisov circa 1993.

El Cid is portrayed by American actor Charlton Heston in a 1961 epic film of the same name directed by Anthony Mann, where the character of Doña Ximena is portrayed by Italian actress Sophia Loren. In 2020, Amazon Prime Video premiered a Spanish TV series with Jaime Lorente starring as &quot;El Cid&quot;.

In 1979, Crack, one of the most prominent progressive rock bands from Spain, released their first and only album &quot;Si Todo Hiciera Crack&quot; including &quot;Marchando una del Cid&quot;, a song based on the epic legend of El Cid.

In 1980, &quot;Ruy, the Little Cid&quot; was an animated series based on El Cid&#x27;s childhood made by Nippon Animation.

El Cid was described to inspire Ferny about his Spanish heritage in &quot;The Legend of Raloo&quot;, episode 16 of season 1 of &quot;Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks&quot; in 2004.

In the second &quot;Age of Empires&quot; video game installment, &quot;The Conquerors&quot; expansion pack, there is a campaign starring El Cid Campeador.

In both the first and second &quot;&quot; games, El Cid appears as a powerful independent general in the castle of Valencia.

In 2003, the Spanish animated film &quot;El Cid: The Legend&quot; was released.

&quot;The Ministry of Time&quot;, a Spanish science fiction television series, portrayed El Cid in season 2, episode 1.

El Cid is a playable character in the Mobile/PC Game Rise of Kingdoms.

El Cid is a playable character in &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot; and Crusader Kings III in start dates corresponding to his historical rule over Valencia.

<doc id="10078" wikidata="Q203402" url="?curid=10078" title="Enjambment">
<text>In poetry, enjambment (; from the French &quot;enjamber&quot;) is incomplete syntax at the end of a line; the meaning &#x27;runs over&#x27; or &#x27;steps over&#x27; from one poetic line to the next, without punctuation. Lines without enjambment are end-stopped. The origin of the word is credited to the French word &quot;enjamber&quot;, which means &#x27;to straddle or encroach&#x27;.

In reading, the delay of meaning creates a tension that is released when the word or phrase that completes the syntax is encountered (called the rejet); the tension arises from the &quot;mixed message&quot; produced both by the pause of the line-end, and the suggestion to continue provided by the incomplete meaning. In spite of the apparent contradiction between rhyme, which heightens closure, and enjambment, which delays it, the technique is compatible with rhymed verse. Even in couplets, the closed or heroic couplet was a late development; older is the open couplet, where rhyme and enjambed lines co-exist.

Enjambment has a long history in poetry. Homer used the technique, and it is the norm for alliterative verse where rhyme is unknown. In the 32nd Psalm of the Hebrew Bible enjambment is unusually conspicuous. It was used extensively in England by Elizabethan poets for dramatic and narrative verses, before giving way to closed couplets. The example of John Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; laid the foundation for its subsequent use by the English Romantic poets; in its preface he identified it as one of the chief features of his verse: &quot;sense variously drawn out from one verse into another&quot;.

== Examples ==
The start of &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot, with only lines 4 and 7 end-stopped:
These lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (&quot;c.&quot; 1611) are heavily enjambed (meaning enjambment is used):
Meaning flows as the lines progress, and the reader&#x27;s eye is forced to go on to the next sentence. It can also make the reader feel uncomfortable or the poem feel like &quot;flow-of-thought&quot; with a sensation of urgency or disorder. In contrast, the following lines from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (&quot;c.&quot; 1595) are completely end-stopped:

Each line is formally correspondent with a unit of thought—in this case, a clause of a sentence. End-stopping is more frequent in early Shakespeare: as his style developed, the proportion of enjambment in his plays increased. Scholars such as Goswin König and A. C. Bradley have estimated approximate dates of undated works of Shakespeare by studying the frequency of enjambment.

&quot;Endymion&quot; by John Keats, lines 2–4:
The song &quot;One Night In Bangkok&quot;, from the musical &quot;Chess&quot;, written by Tim Rice and Björn Ulvaeus, includes examples such as :

Closely related to enjambment is the technique of &quot;broken rhyme&quot; or &quot;split rhyme&quot; which involves the splitting of an individual word, typically to allow a rhyme with one or more syllables of the split word. In English verse, broken rhyme is used almost exclusively in light verse, such as to form a word that rhymes with &quot;orange&quot;, as in this example by Willard Espy, in his poem &quot;The Unrhymable Word: Orange&quot;:
The clapping game &quot;Miss Susie&quot; uses the break &quot;... Hell / -o operator&quot; to allude to the taboo word &quot;Hell&quot;, then replaces it with the innocuous &quot;Hello&quot;.

<text>The European Convention on Nationality (E.T.S. No. 166) was signed in Strasbourg on 6 November 1997. It is a comprehensive convention of the Council of Europe dealing with the law of nationality. The convention is open for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe and the non-member States which have participated in its elaboration and for accession by other non-member States. The Convention came into force on 1 March 2000 after ratification by 3 countries. , the convention has been signed by 29 countries and ratified by 21 of those countries.

==Provisions==
Article 4(d) provides that neither marriage nor dissolution of marriage shall automatically affect the nationality of either spouse, nor shall a change of nationality by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the nationality of their spouse. Common practice among states at the beginning of the 20th century was that a woman was to have the nationality of her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the nationality of a married woman was no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses&#x27; original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.

Article 5 provides that no discrimination shall exist in a state&#x27;s internal nationality law on the grounds of &quot;sex, religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin&quot;. It also provides that a state shall not discriminate amongst its nationals on the basis of whether they hold their nationality by birth or acquired it subsequently.

Article 6 relates to the acquisition of nationality. It provides for nationality to be acquired at birth by descent from either parent to those born within the territory of the state. (States may exclude partially or fully children born abroad). It also provides for nationality by virtue of birth in the territory of state; however, states may limit this to only children who would be otherwise stateless. It requires the possibility of naturalisation, and provides that the period of residence required for eligibility cannot be more than ten years lawful and habitual residence. It also requires to &quot;facilitate&quot; the acquisition of nationality by certain persons, including spouses of nationals, children of its nationals born abroad, children one of whose parents has acquired the nationality, children adopted by a national, persons lawfully and habitually resident for a period before the age of eighteen, and stateless persons and refugees lawfully and habitually resident on its territory.

Article 7 regulates the involuntary loss of nationality. It provides that states may deprive their nationals of their nationality in only the cases of voluntary acquisition of another nationality, fraud or failure to provide relevant information when acquiring nationality, voluntary military service in a foreign military force, or adoption as a child by foreign nationals. It also provides for the possibility of loss of nationality for nationals habitually residing abroad. Finally, it provides loss of nationality for &quot;conduct seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the State Party&quot;.

Article 8 provides nationals with the right to renounce their nationality, providing they do not thereby become stateless. States may however restrict this right with respect to nationals residing abroad.

<doc id="10081" wikidata="Q3491268" url="?curid=10081" title="English orthography">
<text>English orthography comprises the set of rules used when writing the English language, allowing readers and writers to associate written graphemes with the sounds of spoken English, as well as other features of the language. English&#x27;s orthography includes norms for spelling, hyphenation, capitalisation, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.

As with the orthographies of most other world languages, written English is broadly standardised. This standardisation began to develop when movable type spread to England in the late 15th century. However, unlike with most languages, there are multiple ways to spell every phoneme, and most letters also represent multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and the context.

This is partly due to the large number of words that have been loaned from a large number of other languages throughout the history of English, without successful attempts at complete spelling reforms, and partly due to accidents of history, such as some of the earliest mass-produced English publications being typeset by highly trained, multilingual printing compositors, who occasionally used a spelling pattern more typical for another language. For example, the word &quot;ghost&quot; was spelled in Middle English, until the Flemish spelling pattern was unintentionally substituted, and happened to be accepted. Most of the spelling conventions in Modern English were derived from the phonemic spelling of a variety of Middle English, and generally do not reflect the sound changes that have occurred since the late 15th century (such as the Great Vowel Shift).

Despite the various English dialects spoken from country to country and within different regions of the same country, there are only slight regional variations in English orthography, the two most recognised variations being British and American spelling, and its overall uniformity helps facilitate international communication. On the other hand, it also adds to the discrepancy between the way English is written and spoken in any given location.

== Function of letters ==
=== Phonemic representation ===
Letters in English orthography positioned at one location
within a specific word usually represent a particular phoneme. For example, &quot;at&quot; consists of 2 letters and , which represent and , respectively.

Sequences of letters may perform this role as well as single letters. Thus, in &quot;thrash&quot; , the digraph (two letters) represents . In &quot;hatch&quot; , the trigraph represents .

Less commonly, a single letter can represent multiple successive sounds. The most common example is , which normally represents the consonant cluster (for example, in &quot;tax&quot; ).

The same letter (or sequence of letters) may be pronounced differently when occurring in different positions within a word. For instance, represents at the end of some words (&quot;tough&quot; ) but not in others (&quot;plough&quot; ). At the beginning of syllables, is pronounced , as in &quot;ghost&quot; . Conversely, is never pronounced in syllable onsets other than in inflected forms, and is almost never pronounced in syllable codas (the proper name &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; is an exception).

Some words contain silent letters, which do not represent any sound in modern English pronunciation. Examples include the in &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;calf&quot;, etc., the in &quot;two&quot; and &quot;sword&quot;, as mentioned above in numerous words such as &quot;though&quot;, &quot;daughter&quot;, &quot;night&quot;, &quot;brought&quot;, and the commonly encountered silent (discussed further below).

=== Word origin ===
Another type of spelling characteristic is related to word origin. For example, when representing a vowel, represents the sound in some words borrowed from Greek (reflecting an original upsilon), whereas the letter usually representing this sound in non-Greek words is the letter . Thus, &quot;myth&quot; is of Greek origin, while &quot;pith&quot; is a Germanic word. However, a large number of Germanic words have in word-final position.

Some other examples are pronounced (which is most commonly ), and pronounced (which is most commonly or ). The use of these spellings for these sounds often marks words that have been borrowed from Greek.

Some researchers, such as Brengelman (1970), have suggested that, in addition to this marking of word origin, these spellings indicate a more formal level of style or register in a given text, although Rollings (2004) finds this point to be exaggerated as there would be many exceptions where a word with one of these spellings, such as for (like &quot;telephone&quot;), could occur in an informal text.

=== Homophone differentiation ===
Spelling may also be useful to distinguish in written language between homophones (words with the same pronunciation but different meanings), and thus resolve potential ambiguities that would arise otherwise. However in most cases the reason for the difference is historical, and it was not introduced to resolve amibiguity.

;Examples

* &quot;heir&quot; and &quot;air&quot; are pronounced identically in most dialects, but spelt differently.

* &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;pane&quot; are both pronounced but have two different spellings of the vowel . This arose because the two words were originally pronounced differently: &quot;pain&quot; used to be pronounced as , with a diphthong, and &quot;pane&quot; as , but the diphthong merged with the long vowel in &quot;pane&quot;, making &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;pane&quot; homophones (&quot;pane&quot;–&quot;pain&quot; merger). Later became a diphthong .

* &quot;break&quot; and &quot;brake&quot;: (&quot;She&#x27;s breaking the car&quot; vs. &quot;She&#x27;s braking the car&quot;).

Nevertheless, many homophones remain that are unresolved by spelling (for example, the word &quot;&quot; has at least five fundamentally different meanings).

=== Marking sound changes in other letters ===
Some letters in English provide information about the pronunciation of other letters in the word. Rollings (2004) uses the term &quot;markers&quot; for such letters. Letters may mark different types of information.

For instance, in &quot;once&quot; indicates that the preceding is pronounced , rather than the more common value of in word-final position as the sound , such as in &quot;attic&quot; .

 also often marks an altered pronunciation of a preceding vowel. In the pair &quot;mat&quot; and &quot;mate&quot;, the of &quot;mat&quot; has the value , whereas the of &quot;mate&quot; is marked by the as having the value . In this context, the is not pronounced, and is referred to as a &quot;silent e&quot;.

A single letter may even fill multiple pronunciation-marking roles simultaneously. For example, in the word &quot;ace&quot;, marks not only the change of from to , but also of from to . In the word &quot;vague&quot;, marks the long sound, but keeps the hard rather than soft.

Doubled consonants usually indicate that the preceding vowel is pronounced short. For example, the doubled in &quot;batted&quot; indicates that the is pronounced , while the single of &quot;bated&quot; gives . Doubled consonants only indicate any lengthening or gemination of the consonant sound itself when they come from different morphemes, as with the in &quot;unnamed&quot; (&quot;un&quot;+&quot;named&quot;).

=== Multiple functionality ===
Any given letters may have dual functions. For example, in &quot;statue&quot; has a sound-representing function (representing the sound ) and a pronunciation-marking function (marking the as having the value opposed to the value ).

=== Underlying representation ===
Like many other alphabetic orthographies, English spelling does not represent non-contrastive phonetic sounds (that is, minor differences in pronunciation which are not used to distinguish between different words).

Although the letter is pronounced by most speakers with aspiration at the beginning of words, this is never indicated in the spelling, and, indeed, this phonetic detail is probably not noticeable to the average native speaker not trained in phonetics.

However, unlike some orthographies, English orthography often represents a very abstract underlying representation (or morphophonemic form) of English words.

In these cases, a given morpheme (i.e., a component of a word) has a fixed spelling even though it is pronounced differently in different words. An example is the past tense suffix -, which may be pronounced variously as , , or (for example, &quot;pay&quot; , &quot;payed&quot; , &quot;hate&quot; , &quot;hated&quot; ). As it happens, these different pronunciations of - can be predicted by a few phonological rules, but that is not the reason why its spelling is fixed.

Another example involves the vowel differences (with accompanying stress pattern changes) in several related words. For instance, &quot;photographer&quot; is derived from &quot;photograph&quot; by adding the derivational suffix -. When this suffix is added, the vowel pronunciations change largely owing to the moveable stress:

Other examples of this type are the - suffix (as in &quot;agile&quot; vs. &quot;agility&quot;, &quot;acid&quot; vs. &quot;acidity&quot;, &quot;divine&quot; vs. &quot;divinity&quot;, &quot;sane&quot; vs. &quot;sanity&quot;). See also: Trisyllabic laxing.

Another example includes words like &quot;mean&quot; and &quot;meant&quot; , where is pronounced differently in the two related words. Thus, again, the orthography uses only a single spelling that corresponds to the single morphemic form rather than to the surface phonological form.

English orthography does not always provide an underlying representation; sometimes it provides an intermediate representation between the underlying form and the surface pronunciation. This is the case with the spelling of the regular plural morpheme, which is written as either - (as in &quot;tat, tats&quot; and &quot;hat, hats&quot;) or - (as in &quot;glass, glasses&quot;). Here, the spelling - is pronounced either or (depending on the environment, e.g., &quot;tats&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; ) while - is usually pronounced (e.g. &quot;classes&quot; ). Thus, there are two different spellings that correspond to the single underlying representation || of the plural suffix and the three surface forms. The spelling indicates the insertion of before the in the spelling -, but does not indicate the devoiced distinctly from the unaffected in the spelling -.

The abstract representation of words as indicated by the orthography can be considered advantageous since it makes etymological relationships more apparent to English readers. This makes writing English more complex, but arguably makes reading English more efficient. However, very abstract underlying representations, such as that of Chomsky &amp; Halle (1968) or of underspecification theories, are sometimes considered too abstract to accurately reflect the communicative competence of native speakers. Followers of these arguments believe the less abstract surface forms are more &quot;psychologically real&quot; and thus more useful in terms of pedagogy.

== Diacritics ==

Some English words can be written with diacritics; these are mostly loanwords, usually from French. As vocabulary becomes naturalised, there is an increasing tendency to omit the accent marks, even in formal writing. For example, &quot;rôle&quot; and &quot;hôtel&quot; originally had accents when they were borrowed into English, but now the accents are almost never used. The words were originally considered foreign—and some people considered that English alternatives were preferable—but today their foreign origin is largely forgotten. Words most likely to retain the accent are those atypical of English morphology and therefore still perceived as slightly foreign. For example, &quot;café&quot; and &quot;pâté&quot; both have a pronounced final , which would otherwise be silent under the normal English pronunciation rules. Moreover, in &quot;pâté&quot;, the acute accent is helpful to distinguish it from &quot;pate&quot;.

Further examples of words sometimes retaining diacritics when used in English are: &quot;ångström&quot;—partly because its symbol is —&quot;appliqué&quot;, &quot;attaché&quot;, &quot;blasé&quot;, &quot;bric-à-brac&quot;, &quot;Brötchen&quot;, &quot;cliché&quot;, &quot;crème&quot;, &quot;crêpe&quot;, &quot;façade&quot;, &quot;fiancé(e)&quot;, &quot;flambé&quot;, &quot;jalapeño&quot;, &quot;naïve&quot;, &quot;naïveté&quot;, &quot;né(e)&quot;, &quot;papier-mâché&quot;, &quot;passé&quot;, &quot;piñata&quot;, &quot;protégé&quot;, &quot;résumé&quot;, &quot;risqué&quot;, and &quot;voilà&quot;. Italics, with appropriate accents, are generally applied to foreign terms that are uncommonly used in or have not been assimilated into English: for example, &#x27;, &quot;belles-lettres&quot;, &quot;crème brûlée&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;.

It was formerly common in American English to use a diaeresis to indicate a hiatus, e.g. &quot;coöperate&quot;, &quot;daïs&quot;, and &quot;reëlect&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Technology Review&quot; magazines still use it for this purpose, even as general use became much rarer. Instead, modern orthography generally prefers no mark (&quot;cooperate&quot;) or a hyphen (&quot;co-operate&quot;) for a hiatus between two morphemes in a compound word. By contrast, use of diaereses in monomorphemic loanwords such as &quot;naïve&quot; and &quot;Noël&quot; remains relatively common.

In poetry and performance arts, accent marks are occasionally used to indicate typically unstressed syllables that should be stressed when read for dramatic or prosodic effect. This is frequently seen with the &quot;-ed&quot; suffix in archaic and pseudoarchaic writing, e.g. &quot;cursèd&quot; indicates the should be fully pronounced. The grave being to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (&quot;warnèd&quot;, &quot;parlìament&quot;).

== Ligatures ==
In certain older texts (typically British), the use of the ligatures and is common in words such as &quot;archæology&quot;, &quot;diarrhœa&quot;, and &quot;encyclopædia&quot;, all of Latin or Greek origin. Nowadays, the ligatures have been generally replaced by the digraphs and (&quot;encyclopaedia&quot;, &quot;diarrhoea&quot;) in British English or just (&quot;encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;diarrhea&quot;) in American English, though both spell some words with only (&quot;economy&quot;, &quot;ecology&quot;) and others with and (&quot;paean&quot;, &quot;amoeba&quot;, &quot;oedipal&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot;). In some cases, usage may vary; for instance, both &quot;encyclopedia&quot; and &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; are current in the UK.

== Phonic irregularities ==
Partly because English has never had any official regulating authority for spelling, such as the Spanish , the French , the German &quot;Council for German Orthography&quot;, the Danish &quot;Sprognævn&quot;, and the Thai Royal Society, English spelling is considered irregular and complex compared to that of other languages. Although French, Danish, and Thai, among other languages, present a similar degree of difficulty when &quot;encoding&quot; (writing), English is more difficult when &quot;decoding&quot; (reading), as there are clearly many more possible pronunciations of a group of letters. For example, in French, (as in &quot;true&quot;, but short), can be spelled (&quot;ou&quot;, &quot;nous&quot;, &quot;tout&quot;, &quot;choux&quot;), but the pronunciation of each of those sequences is always the same. However, in English, while can be spelled in up to 24 different ways, including (&quot;spook&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;suit&quot;, &quot;blues&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, &quot;through&quot;) (see Sound-to-spelling correspondences below), all of these spellings have other pronunciations as well (e.g., &quot;foot&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;build&quot;, &quot;bluest&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;toe&quot;, &quot;grout&quot;, &quot;plough&quot;, &quot;sew&quot;) Thus, in unfamiliar words and proper nouns, the pronunciation of some sequences,  being the prime example, is unpredictable even for educated native speakers.

== Spelling irregularities ==
Attempts to regularise or reform the spelling of English have usually failed. However, Noah Webster promoted more phonetic spellings in the United States, such as &quot;flavor&quot; for British &quot;flavour&quot;, &quot;fiber&quot; for &quot;fibre&quot;, &quot;defense&quot; for &quot;defence&quot;, &quot;analyze&quot; for &quot;analyse&quot;, &quot;catalog&quot; for &quot;catalogue&quot;, and so forth. These spellings already existed as alternatives, but Webster&#x27;s dictionaries helped standardise them in the United States. (See American and British English spelling differences for details.)

Besides the quirks the English spelling system has inherited from its past, there are other irregularities in spelling that make it tricky to learn. English contains, depending on dialect, 24–27 consonant phonemes and 13–20 vowels. However, there are only 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, so there is not a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, represents two different sounds (the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives) (see Pronunciation of English &quot;th&quot;), and the voiceless alveolar sibilant can be represented by or .

It is, however, not (solely) the shortage of letters which makes English spelling irregular. Its irregularities are caused mainly by the use of many different spellings for some of its sounds, such as and (&quot;too, &quot;true, &quot;shoe, &quot;flew, &quot;through; &quot;sleeve&quot;, &quot;leave&quot;, even&quot;, &quot;seize&quot;, &quot;siege&quot;; &quot;stole, &quot;coal&quot;, &quot;bowl&quot;, &quot;roll&quot;, old&quot;, &quot;mould&quot;), and the use of identical sequences for spelling different sounds (over&quot;, oven&quot;, &quot;move&quot;).

Furthermore, English no longer makes any attempt to anglicise the spellings of loanwords, but preserves the foreign spellings, even when they do not follow English spelling conventions like the Polish in &quot;Czech&quot; (rather than &quot;*Check&quot;) or the Norwegian in &quot;fjord&quot; (although &quot;fiord&quot; was formerly the most common spelling). In early Middle English, until roughly 1400, most imports from French were respelled according to English rules (e.g. &quot;bataille&quot;–&quot;battle&quot;, &quot;bouton&quot;–&quot;button&quot;, but not &quot;double&quot;, or &quot;trouble&quot;). Instead of loans being respelled to conform to English spelling standards, sometimes the pronunciation changes as a result of pressure from the spelling, e.g. &quot;ski&quot;, adopted from Norwegian in the mid-18th century. It used to be pronounced , similar to the Norwegian pronunciation, but the increasing popularity of the sport after the mid-20th century helped the pronunciation replace it.

There was also a period when the spelling of a small number of words was altered to make them conform to their perceived etymological origins. For example, was added to &quot;debt&quot; (originally &quot;dette&quot;) to link it to the Latin , and in &quot;island&quot; to link it to Latin instead of its true origin, the Old English word &quot;īġland&quot;. in &quot;ptarmigan&quot; has no etymological justification whatsoever, only seeking to show Greek origin despite being a Gaelic word.

The spelling of English continues to evolve. Many loanwords come from languages where the pronunciation of vowels corresponds to the way they were pronounced in Old English, which is similar to the Italian or Spanish pronunciation of the vowels, and is the value the vowel symbols have in the International Phonetic Alphabet. As a result, there is a somewhat regular system of pronouncing &quot;foreign&quot; words in English, and some borrowed words have had their spelling changed to conform to this system. For example, &quot;Hindu&quot; used to be spelled &quot;Hindoo&quot;, and the name &quot;Maria&quot; used to be pronounced like the name &quot;Mariah&quot;, but was changed to conform to this system. This only further complicates the spelling, however. On the one hand, words that retained anglicised spellings may be misread in a hyperforeign way. On the other hand, words that are respelled in a &#x27;foreign&#x27; way may be misread as if they are English words, e.g. &quot;Muslim&quot; was formerly spelled &quot;Mooslim&quot; because of its original pronunciation.

Commercial advertisers have also had an effect on English spelling. They introduced new or simplified spellings like &quot;lite&quot; instead of &quot;light&quot;, &quot;thru&quot; instead of &quot;through&quot;, and &quot;rucsac&quot; instead of &quot;rucksack&quot;. The spellings of personal names have also been a source of spelling innovations: diminutive versions of women&#x27;s names that sound the same as men&#x27;s names have been spelled differently: &quot;Nikki&quot; and &quot;Nicky&quot;, &quot;Toni&quot; and &quot;Tony&quot;, &quot;Jo&quot; and &quot;Joe&quot;. The differentiation in between names that are spelled differently but have the same phonetic sound may come from modernisation or different countries of origin. For example, &quot;Isabelle&quot; and &quot;Isabel&quot; sound the same but are spelled differently; these versions are from France and Spain respectively.

As an example of the irregular nature of English spelling, can be pronounced at least nine different ways: in &quot;out&quot;, in &quot;soul&quot;, in &quot;soup&quot;, in &quot;touch&quot;, in &quot;could&quot;, in &quot;four&quot;, in &quot;journal&quot;, in &quot;cough&quot;, and in &quot;famous&quot; (See Spelling-to-sound correspondences). In the other direction, can be spelled in at least 18~21 different ways: &quot;be (&quot;cede), &quot;ski (&quot;machine), &quot;bologna , &quot;algae, &quot;quay, &quot;beach&quot;, &quot;bee, &quot;deceit&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, &quot;key, &quot;keyed&quot;, &quot;field&quot; (&quot;hygiene), &quot;amoeba&quot;, &quot;chamois&quot; , &quot;dengue , &quot;beguine&quot;, &quot;guyot&quot;, and ynambu&quot; (See Sound-to-spelling correspondences). (These examples assume a more-or-less standard non-regional British English accent. Other accents will vary.)

Sometimes everyday speakers of English change counterintuitive spellings, with the new spellings usually not judged to be entirely correct. However, such forms may gain acceptance if used enough. An example is the word &quot;miniscule&quot;, which still competes with its original spelling of &quot;minuscule&quot;, though this might also be because of analogy with the word &quot;mini&quot;.

=== History ===
Inconsistencies and irregularities in English pronunciation and spelling have gradually increased in number throughout the history of the English language. There are a number of contributing factors. First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the Great Vowel Shift, account for a tremendous number of irregularities. Second, more recent loan words generally carry their original spellings, which are often not phonetic in English; this includes romanized words from languages written using non-Latin scripts.

The regular spelling system of Old English was swept away by the Norman Conquest, and English itself was supplanted in some spheres by Norman French for three centuries, eventually emerging with its spelling much influenced by French. English had also borrowed large numbers of words from French, and kept their French spellings. The spelling of Middle English is very irregular and inconsistent, with the same word being spelled in different ways, sometimes even in the same sentence. However, these were generally much better guides to the then-pronunciation than modern English spelling is.

For example, , normally written , is spelled with an in &quot;one&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, etc., due to Norman spelling conventions which prohibited writing before due to the graphical confusion that would result. ( were written identically with two minims in Norman handwriting; was written as two letters; was written with three minims, hence looked like , etc.). Similarly, spelling conventions also prohibited final . Hence the identical spellings of the three different vowel sounds in &quot;love&quot;, &quot;move&quot;, and &quot;cove&quot; are due to ambiguity in the Middle English spelling system, not sound change.

In 1417, Henry V began using English, which had no standardised spelling, for official correspondence instead of Latin or French which had standardised spelling, e.g. Latin had one spelling for &quot;right&quot; (&quot;rectus&quot;), Old French as used in English law had six and Middle English had 77. This motivated writers to standardise English spelling, an effort which lasted about 500 years.

There was also a series of linguistic sound changes towards the end of this period, including the Great Vowel Shift, which resulted in the in &quot;make&quot;, for example, changing from a pure vowel to a diphthong. These changes for the most part did not detract from the rule-governed nature of the spelling system; but, in some cases, they introduced confusing inconsistencies, like the well-known example of the many pronunciations of (&quot;tough&quot;, &quot;through&quot;, &quot;though&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;plough&quot;, etc.). Most of these changes happened before the arrival of printing in England. However, the arrival of the modern printing press in 1476 froze the current system, rather than providing the impetus for a realignment of spelling with pronunciation. Furthermore, it introduced further inconsistencies, partly because of the use of typesetters trained abroad, particularly in the Low Countries. For example, the in &quot;ghost&quot; was influenced by Flemish. The addition and deletion of a silent &quot;e&quot; at the ends of words was also sometimes used to make the right-hand margin line up more neatly.

By the time dictionaries were introduced in the mid-17th century, the spelling system of English had started to stabilise. By the 19th century, most words had set spellings, though it took some time before they diffused throughout the English-speaking world. In &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1860), English novelist George Eliot satirised the attitude of the English rural gentry of the 1820s towards orthography:

The modern English spelling system, with its national variants, spread together with the expansion of public education later in the 19th century.

=== ⟨ough⟩ words ===
The tetragraph can be pronounced in at least ten different ways, six of which are illustrated in the construct, &quot;Though the tough cough and hiccough plough him through&quot;, which is quoted by Robert A. Heinlein in &quot;The Door into Summer&quot; to illustrate the difficulties facing automated speech transcription and reading. &quot;Ough&quot; itself is a word, an exclamation of disgust similar to &quot;ugh&quot;, though rarely known or used. The following are typical pronunciations of this string of letters:

* (as in &quot;so&quot;) in &quot;though&quot; and &quot;dough&quot;
* (as in &quot;cuff&quot;) in &quot;tough&quot;, &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;enough&quot;, and the name &quot;Hough&quot;
* (as in off) in &quot;trough&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, and &quot;Gough&quot;
* (as in &quot;blue&quot;) in &quot;through&quot;
* (as in &quot;saw&quot;) in &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;sought&quot;, &quot;nought&quot;, &quot;brought&quot;, etc.
* (as in &quot;comma&quot;) in &quot;thorough&quot;, &quot;borough&quot;, and names ending in &quot;-borough&quot;; however, American English pronounces this as 
* (as in &quot;how&quot;) in &quot;bough&quot;, &quot;sough&quot;, &quot;drought&quot;, &quot;plough&quot; (&quot;plow&quot; in North America), &quot;doughty&quot;, and the names &quot;Slough&quot; and &quot;Doughty&quot;
* (as in &quot;loch&quot;; mainly in words of Gaelic origin) in the word &quot;lough&quot; (an anglicised variant of &quot;loch&quot; used in Ireland) and in Irish place names, such as &quot;Ardclough&quot;, &quot;Glendalough&quot;, &quot;Loughmoe&quot;, &quot;Loughrea&quot;, etc.

The following pronunciations are found in uncommon single words:
* &quot;hough&quot;: (more commonly spelled &quot;hock&quot; now)
* &quot;hiccough&quot; (a now-uncommon variant of &quot;hiccup&quot;): as in up
* &quot;Oughterard&quot; (Irish place name): 
The place name Loughborough uses two different pronunciations of : the first has the sound as in &quot;cuff and the second rhymes with &quot;thorough.

== Spelling-to-sound correspondences ==

Notes:
* In the tables, the hyphen has two different meanings. A hyphen after the letter indicates that it &quot;must&quot; be at the beginning of a &quot;syllable&quot;, e.g., - in jumper and ajar. A hyphen before the letter indicates that it &quot;cannot&quot; be at the beginning of a &quot;word&quot;, e.g., - in sick and ticket.
* More specific rules take precedence over more general ones, e.g., &quot;- before &quot; takes precedence over &quot;&quot;.
* Where the letter combination is described as &quot;word-final&quot;, inflectional suffixes may be added without changing the pronunciation, e.g., catalogues.
* The dialects used are Received Pronunciation and General American. When pronunciations differ idiosyncratically, a pronunciation that only applies to one of the dialects is noted as being (RP) or (GA). When pronunciations differ systematically in a way that is not accounted for by the diaphonemic transcription system (i.e. the &quot;trap&quot;-&quot;bath&quot; and &quot;lot&quot;-&quot;cloth&quot; splits), the pronunciations in both dialects are given.
* Isolated foreign borrowings are excluded.

=== Vowels ===
In a generative approach to English spelling, Rollings (2004) identifies twenty main orthographic vowels of stressed syllables that are grouped into four main categories: &quot;Lax&quot;, &quot;Tense&quot;, &quot;Heavy&quot;, &quot;Tense-R&quot;.

For instance, can represent the lax vowel , tense , heavy , or tense-r . Heavy and tense-r vowels are the respective lax and tense counterparts followed by .

Tense vowels are distinguished from lax vowels with a &quot;silent&quot; that is added at the end of words. Thus, in &quot;hat&quot; is lax , but when is added in the word &quot;hate&quot; is tense . Heavy and tense-r vowels follow a similar pattern, e.g. in &quot;car&quot; is heavy , followed by silent in &quot;care&quot; is . represents two different vowel patterns, one being , the other . There is no distinction between heavy and tense-r , and in the pattern does not have a heavy vowel.

Besides silent , another strategy for indicating tense and tense-r vowels is the addition of another orthographic vowel forming a digraph. In this case, the first vowel is usually the main vowel while the second vowel is the &quot;marking&quot; vowel. For example, &quot;man&quot; has a lax (), but the addition of (as the digraph ) in &quot;main&quot; marks the as tense (). These two strategies produce words that are spelled differently but pronounced identically, which helps differentiate words that would otherwise be homonyms, as in &quot;mane&quot; (silent strategy), &quot;main&quot; (digraph strategy) and &quot;Maine&quot; (both strategies).

Besides the 20 basic vowel spellings, has a reduced vowel category (representing the sounds ) and a miscellaneous category (representing the sounds and +V, +V, V+V).

=== Combinations of vowel letters excluding those followed by ⟨r⟩ ===
To reduce dialectal difficulties, the sound values given here correspond to the conventions at . This table includes when they represent vowel sounds. If no information is given, it is assumed that the vowel is in a stressed syllable.

Deriving the pronunciation of an English word from its spelling requires not only a careful knowledge of the rules given below (many of which are not explicitly known even by native speakers: speakers merely learn the spelling of a word along with its pronunciation) and their many exceptions, but also:

* a knowledge of which syllables are stressed and which are unstressed (not derivable from the spelling: compare &quot;hallow&quot; and &quot;allow&quot;)
* which combinations of vowels represent monosyllables and which represent disyllables (ditto: compare &quot;waive&quot; and &quot;naive&quot;, &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;creator&quot;)

The pronunciation of vowel letters when followed by is covered in a separate table below.

=== Combinations of vowel letters and ⟨r⟩ ===
=== Combinations of other consonant and vowel letters ===

== Sound-to-spelling correspondences ==
The following table shows for each sound the various spelling patterns used to denote it, starting with the prototypical pattern(s) followed by others in alphabetical order. Some of these patterns are very rare or unique (such as for , for , for ). An ellipsis () stands for an intervening consonant.

=== Consonants ===
Arranged in the order of the IPA consonant tables.

=== Vowels ===
Nasal vowels used by some speakers in words of French origin such as &quot;enceinte&quot; (), are not included.

=== Vowels followed by ===
Nasal vowels used by some speakers in words of French origin such as &quot;enceinte&quot; (), are not included.
