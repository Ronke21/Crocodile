<text>A chronicle (, from Greek &quot;chroniká&quot;, from , &quot;chrónos&quot; – &quot;time&quot;) is a historical account of events arranged in chronological order, as in a timeline. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. A chronicle which traces world history is a universal chronicle. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, in which an author chooses events to interpret and analyze and excludes those the author does not consider important or relevant.

The information sources for chronicles vary. Some are written from the chronicler&#x27;s direct knowledge, others from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. Some used written material, such as charters, letters, and earlier chronicles. Still others are tales of unknown origin that have mythical status. Copyists also changed chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original chronicler. Determining the reliability of particular chronicles is important to historians.

Many newspapers and other periodical literature have adopted &quot;chronicle&quot; as part of their name. 

==Subgroups==
Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A &quot;dead&quot; chronicle is one where the author assembles a list of events up to the time of their writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A &quot;live&quot; chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as annals, over dead ones.

The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. The earliest medieval chronicle to combine both retrospective (&quot;dead&quot;) and contemporary (&quot;live&quot;) entries, is the Chronicle of Ireland, which spans the years 431 to 911.

Chronicles are the predecessors of modern &quot;time lines&quot; rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent continuators. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called annals. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point of view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual abbeys.

It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle&quot; lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

==Citation of entries==
Entries in chronicles are often cited using the abbreviation &quot;s.a.&quot;, meaning &quot;sub anno&quot; (under the year), according to the year under which they are listed. For example, &quot;&quot;ASC&quot; MS A, s.a. 855&quot; means the entry for the year 855 in manuscript A of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The same event may be recorded under a different year in another manuscript of the chronicle, and may be cited for example as &quot;&quot;ASC&quot; MS D, s.a. 857&quot;.

==English chronicles==
The most important English chronicles are the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; (1577–87) by Raphael Holinshed and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama. Later 16th century Scottish chronicles, written after the Reformation, shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.

==Cronista==
A cronista is a term for a historical chronicler, a role that held historical significance in the European Middle Ages. Until the European Enlightenment, the occupation was largely equivalent to that of a historian, describing events chronologically that were of note in a given country or region. As such, it was often an official governmental position rather than an independent practice. The appointment of the official chronicler often favored individuals who had distinguished themselves by their efforts to study, investigate and disseminate population-related issues. The position was granted on a local level based on the mutual agreements of a city council in plenary meetings. Often, the occupation was honorary, unpaid, and stationed for life. In modern usage, the term usually refers to a type of journalist who writes chronicles as a form of journalism or non-professional historical documentation.

===Cronista in the Middle Ages===
Before the development of modern journalism and the systematization of chronicles as a journalistic genre, cronista were tasked with narrating chronological events considered worthy of remembrance that were recorded year by year. Unlike writers who created epic poems regarding living figures, cronista recorded historical events in the lives of individuals in an ostensibly truthful and reality-oriented way. 
Even from the time of early Christian historiography, cronistas were clearly expected to place human history in the context of a linear progression, starting with the creation of man until the second coming of Christ, as prophesied in biblical texts.

<doc id="7512" wikidata="Q3686031" url="?curid=7512" title="Concentration">
<text>In chemistry, concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: &quot;mass concentration&quot;, &quot;molar concentration&quot;, &quot;number concentration&quot;, and &quot;volume concentration&quot;. The concentration can refer to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. The molar (amount) concentration has variants, such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration. Dilution is reduction of concentration, e.g. by adding solvent to a solution. The verb means to increase concentration, the opposite of dilute.

==Etymology==
&quot;Concentration-&quot;, &quot;concentratio&quot;, action or an act of coming together at a single place, bringing to a common center, was used in post-classical Latin in 1550 or earlier, similar terms attested in Italian (1589), Spanish (1589), English (1606), French (1632).

==Qualitative description==

Often in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as &quot;dilute&quot; for solutions of relatively low concentration and &quot;concentrated&quot; for solutions of relatively high concentration. To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of solvent (for example, water). By contrast, to dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are miscible, there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be saturated. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when supersaturation may occur. Instead, phase separation will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a suspension. The point of saturation depends on many variables, such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.

Concentrations are often called levels, reflecting the mental schema of levels on the vertical axis of a graph, which can be high or low (for example, &quot;high serum levels of bilirubin&quot; are concentrations of bilirubin in the blood serum that are greater than normal).

==Quantitative notation==

There are four quantities that describe concentration:

===Mass concentration===
The mass concentration formula_1 is defined as the mass of a constituent formula_2 divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:

:formula_4

The SI unit is kg/m3 (equal to g/L).

===Molar concentration===
The molar concentration formula_5 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:

:formula_8

The SI unit is mol/m3. However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm3) is used.

===Number concentration===
The number concentration formula_9 is defined as the number of entities of a constituent formula_10 in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:

:formula_12

The SI unit is 1/m3.

===Volume concentration===

The volume concentration formula_13 (not to be confused with volume fraction) is defined as the volume of a constituent formula_14 divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:

:formula_16

Being dimensionless, it is expressed as a number, e.g., 0.18 or 18%.

There seems to be no standard notation in the English literature. The letter formula_13 used here is normative in German literature (see Volumenkonzentration).

==Related quantities==

Several other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. These should not be called concentrations.

===Normality===
Normality is defined as the molar concentration formula_5 divided by an equivalence factor formula_19. Since the definition of the equivalence factor depends on context (which reaction is being studied), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and National Institute of Standards and Technology discourage the use of normality.

===Molality===

The molality of a solution formula_20 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the mass of the solvent formula_22 (not the mass of the solution):

:formula_23

The SI unit for molality is mol/kg.

===Mole fraction===
The mole fraction formula_24 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture formula_26:

:formula_27

The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole fractions.

===Mole ratio===
The mole ratio formula_28 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 divided by the total amount of all &quot;other&quot; constituents in a mixture:

:formula_30

If formula_6 is much smaller than formula_26, the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction.

The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole ratios.

===Mass fraction===
The mass fraction formula_33 is the fraction of one substance with mass formula_2 to the mass of the total mixture formula_35, defined as:

:formula_36

The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass fractions.

===Mass ratio===
The mass ratio formula_37 is defined as the mass of a constituent formula_2 divided by the total mass of all &quot;other&quot; constituents in a mixture:

:formula_39

If formula_2 is much smaller than formula_35, the mass ratio is almost identical to the mass fraction.

The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass ratios.

==Dependence on volume and temperature==
Concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution with temperature, due mainly to thermal expansion.

<doc id="7515" wikidata="Q5196943" url="?curid=7515" title="Cutter Expansive Classification">
<text>The Cutter Expansive Classification system is a library classification system devised by Charles Ammi Cutter. The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress Classification.

== History of the Expansive Classification ==
Charles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, and with Dewey&#x27;s initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester, Massachusetts town library and then the Boston Athenaeum, at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years. He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the Cary Library in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Many libraries found this system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted for their collections. While numbers and letters are required in large library classifications, small libraries did not need their classification system to be too specific. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics. Cutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system (&quot;Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications&quot;), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903.

The Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Library historian Leo E. LaMontagne wrote:

Cutter produced the best classification of the nineteenth century. While his system was less &quot;scientific&quot; than that of J. P. Lesley, its other key features – notation, specificity, and versatility – make it deserving of the praise it has received.

Its top level divisions served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey&#x27;s system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the twentieth century.

== Structure of the Expansive Classification ==
The Expansive Classification uses seven separate schedules, each designed to be used by libraries of different sizes. After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one, and Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows.

== Summary of the Expansive Classification schedules ==

=== First classification ===
The first classification is meant for very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top-level classes, and only eight classes in total:

* A Works of reference and general works which include several of the following sections, and so could not go in any one.
* B Philosophy and Religion
* E Biography
* F History and Geography and Travels
* H Social sciences
* L Natural sciences and Arts
* Y Language and Literature
* YF Fiction

=== Further classifications ===
Further expansions add more top-level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout.

By the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top-level classes. These are:

* A General Works
* B Philosophy
* C Christianity and Judaism
* D Ecclesiastical History
* E Biography
* F History, Universal History
* G Geography and Travels
* H Social Sciences
* I Demotics, Sociology
* J Civics, Government, Political Science
* K Legislation
* L Science and Arts together
* M Natural History
* N Botany
* O Zoology
* P Anthropology and Ethnology
* Q Medicine
* R Useful arts, Technology
* S Constructive arts (Engineering and Building)
* T Manufactures and Handicrafts
* U Art of War
* V Recreative arts, Sports, Games, Festivals
* W Art
* X English Language
* Y English and American literature
* Z Book arts

These schedules were not meant to be fixed, but were to be adapted to meet the needs of each library. For example, books on the English language may be put in X, and books on language in general in a subclass of X, or this can be reversed. The first option is less logical, but results in shorter marks for most English language libraries.

== Construction of call numbers ==

Most call numbers in the Expansive Classification follow conventions offering clues to the book&#x27;s subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Expansive Classification are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.

Size of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //).

For some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States—hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.

The second line usually represents the author&#x27;s name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a, b, c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a &#x27;form&#x27; number—e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.

On the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English—other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.

=== Cutter numbers (Cutter codes) ===

One of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules. Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.

Initial letters Qa–Qt are assigned Q2–Q29, while entries beginning with numerals have a Cutter number A12–A19, therefore sorting before the first A entry.

So to make the three-digit Cutter number for &quot;Cutter&quot;, one would start with &quot;C&quot;, then looking under &quot;other consonants&quot;, find that &quot;u&quot; gives the number 8, and under &quot;additional letters&quot;, &quot;t&quot; is 8, giving a Cutter number of &quot;C88&quot;.

<text>Muhtar Cem Karaca (5 April 1945 – 8 February 2004) was a Turkish rock musician and one of the most important figures in the Anatolian rock movement. He was a graduate of Robert College. He worked with various Turkish rock bands such as Apaşlar, Kardaşlar, Moğollar and Dervişan. With these bands, he brought a new understanding and interpretation to Turkish rock. 

==Biography==

He was the only child of Mehmet İbrahim Karaca, a theatre actor of Azerbaijani origin, and İrma Felekyan, a popular opera, theatre, and movie actress of Armenian origin. His first group was called &quot;Dynamites&quot; and was a classic rock cover band. Later he joined &quot;Jaguars&quot;, an Elvis Presley cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, joining the band &quot;Apaşlar&quot; (The Rowdies), his first Turkish language group. The same year, he participated in the Golden Microphone () contest, a popular music contest in which he won second place with his song &quot;Emrah&quot;. In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apaşlar and started an original Anatolian group called &quot;Kardaşlar&quot; (The Brothers).

In 1972, Karaca joined the group &quot;Moğollar&quot; (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, &quot;Namus Belası&quot;. However, Cahit Berkay, the leader of Moğollar, wanted an international reputation for his band, and he left for France to take the group to the next level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Moğollar and started his own band &quot;Dervişan&quot; (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervişan sang poetic and progressive songs.

In the 1970s, Turkey was dealing with political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of Islamism. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement in rebel organisations. He was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a Marxist-Leninist. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, &quot;Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state.&quot; &quot;Dervişan&quot; was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. In 1978, he founded &quot;Edirdahan&quot;, an acronym for &quot;from Edirne to Ardahan&quot;; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with &quot;Edirdahan&quot; called &quot;&quot;Safinaz&quot;.

In early 1979, Karaca left for Cologne, West Germany for business reasons. In 1980 he began singing in German with the song Nazim Hikmet - &quot;Kız Çocuğu&quot; (&quot;Little girl&quot;): Cem performed the German verses alternating with his best friend, manager, producer, arranger and bandleader/bass player/keyboarder/drummer, guitar player &quot;Ralf Mähnhöfer&quot; accompanying him on grand piano, solo or with the band &quot;Anatology&quot;, singing the song in the Turkish language.

Turkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état on September 12, 1980. General Kenan Evren took over the government and temporarily banned all the nation&#x27;s political parties. After the coup, many intellectuals, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey.

The state invited Karaca back several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.

While Karaca was in Germany his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.

Several years later, in 1987, the prime minister and leader of the Turkish Motherland Party, Turgut Özal, issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album with it, which released in September 12 of that year, &quot;Merhaba Gençler ve Her Zaman Genç Kalanlar&quot; (&quot;Hello, The Young and The Young at Heart&quot;&quot;), one of his most influential works. His return home was received cheerfully by his fans, but during his absence Karaca had lost the young audience and acquired only a few new listeners. He died of a heart attack on February 8, 2004, and was interred at Karacaahmet Cemetery in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul.

==Musical Style==
The appreciation towards Cem Karaca won&#x27;t be easy while at the same time he is also one of the most powerful voices of the Turkish rock scene. But the music styles audience will find him singing however will range very much, from severe mellowness chanson until powerful progressive song-based rock music. His first records were surely progressive, in a rock-sense, and Safinaz is symphonic piece comparable to a more western progressive rock albums. It remains rock music. Especially the period with Mogollar should appeal to collectors.

<doc id="7517" wikidata="Q26424" url="?curid=7517" title="Calista Flockhart">
<text>Calista Kay Flockhart (born November 11, 1964) is an American actress. She is best known for portraying the title character on the Fox television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997–2002), for which she received a Golden Globe Award in 1998 and was thrice nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. From 2006 to 2011, she starred as Kitty Walker on the ABC drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, and between 2015 and 2021, Flockhart appeared as Cat Grant on the superhero drama &quot;Supergirl&quot;. In film, she is known for roles in &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1999), and &quot;Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Flockhart was born in Freeport, Illinois, the daughter of Kay Calista, an English teacher, and Ronald Flockhart, a Kraft Foods executive. Her parents retired to Morristown, Tennessee, where her father lived until his death and her mother continues to reside. She has one older brother, Gary. Her mother reversed her own first and middle names in naming her Calista Kay.

Flockhart attended Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. People began recognizing Flockhart&#x27;s acting ability when William Esper (Mason Gross theater director and Flockhart&#x27;s acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue usually is reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot;. Flockhart graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater in 1988 from Rutgers as one of the few students who successfully completed the acting course. Rutgers inducted her into the Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.

==Career==

===Early career===
In spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as a babysitter. She also appeared in a one-hour afternoon special for &quot;&quot;, playing a teenager battling an eating disorder. Flockhart made her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in &quot;Beside Herself&quot; alongside Melissa Joan Hart, at the Circle Repertory Theatre. Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie &quot;Darrow&quot;. Though she later appeared in films &quot;Naked in New York&quot; (1993) and &quot;Getting In&quot; (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, directed by Robert Redford.

Flockhart debuted on Broadway in 1994, as Laura in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. Flockhart received a Clarence Derwent Award for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as Dianne Wiest and Faye Dunaway when she appeared in the movie &quot;Drunks&quot;. In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of Dianne Wiest and Gene Hackman&#x27;s characters in &quot;The Birdcage&quot;. Later that year, Flockhart starred in &quot;Jane Doe&quot; as a drug addict, though it was not released until 1999, over three years after filming ended. Throughout that year, she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;.

===&quot;Ally McBeal&quot;===

In 1997, Flockhart was asked to audition for the starring role in David E. Kelley&#x27;s Fox television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though she hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to Los Angeles to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of feminism, relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character. Flockhart starred on the show until it was canceled in 2002.

===&quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;===

Flockhart performed in a starring role as Kitty Walker, opposite Sally Field, Rachel Griffiths and Matthew Rhys, in the critically acclaimed ABC prime time series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, which premiered in September 2006 in the time slot after &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. The show was cancelled in May 2011 after running for five years. Flockhart&#x27;s character was significant throughout the series&#x27; first four years, but her appearances were reduced for the 2010–2011 season, coinciding with the departure of TV husband Rob Lowe.

===Other work===
Flockhart played the role of Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a 1999 film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s play. In 2000, she appeared in &quot;Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her&quot; and &quot;&quot;, later accompanying Eve Ensler to Kenya in order to protest violence against women, particularly female genital mutilation. Flockhart also starred in the off-Broadway production of Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

In 2004, Flockhart appeared as Matthew Broderick&#x27;s deranged girlfriend in &quot;The Last Shot&quot;. In the same year, Flockhart traveled to Spain for the filming of &quot;Fragile&quot;, which premiered in September 2005 at the Venice Film Festival. She was offered the role of Susan Mayer on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; but declined, and the role later went to Teri Hatcher.

In 2014, Flockhart landed a role in &quot;Full Circle&quot; second season, as mob boss Ellen. It was expected to air in 2015. This had been Flockhart&#x27;s first acting role in three years, after her hiatus when &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; ended.

In 2015, Flockhart was cast in the television series &quot;Supergirl&quot; as Cat Grant, a &quot;self-made media magnate and founder of CatCo&quot; and boss to Kara (Supergirl&#x27;s alter ego). The series premiered on October 26, 2015, on CBS. Due to the network&#x27;s wish to reduce the show&#x27;s budget, it was moved to sister network The CW after its first season, along with a move to filming in Vancouver. Flockhart remained with the show (albeit as a recurring character), despite her previous aversion to working outside Los Angeles.

In 2022, she played the role of Martha opposite Zachary Quinto in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Gordon Greenberg and also starred Aimee Carrero and Graham Phillips.

In 2024, Flockhart appeared as Lee Radziwill in &quot;&quot;, the second season of the anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;. Regarding playing Radziwill in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Flockhart said, “Truman Capote recognized that she was living in her sister’s shadow... and he would say things: ‘You’re so much prettier. You’re so much smarter. You’re more interesting. You have better style.’ She really needed to hear that. I think it made her really love Truman. He was fun, and she confided in him, like they all did.”

==Personal life==
In January 2001, Flockhart announced that she had adopted a baby boy.
Flockhart is married to actor Harrison Ford, whom she first met at the Golden Globe Awards on January 20, 2002. They became engaged on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2009, and were married on June 15, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The ceremony was presided over by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles W. Daniels.

From 2004 to 2014, Flockhart served as the national spokeswoman for Peace Over Violence.

<doc id="7519" wikidata="Q210857" url="?curid=7519" title="Convolution">
<text>In mathematics (in particular, functional analysis), convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (formula_1 and formula_2) that produces a third function (formula_3). The term &quot;convolution&quot; refers to both the resulting function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted. The integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function. The choice of which function is reflected and shifted before the integral does not change the integral result (see commutativity). Graphically, it expresses how the &#x27;shape&#x27; of one function is modified by the other.

Some features of convolution are similar to cross-correlation: for real-valued functions, of a continuous or discrete variable, convolution differs from cross-correlation (formula_4) only in that either formula_5 or formula_6 is reflected about the y-axis in convolution; thus it is a cross-correlation of formula_7 and formula_5, or formula_9 and formula_6. For complex-valued functions, the cross-correlation operator is the adjoint of the convolution operator.

Convolution has applications that include probability, statistics, acoustics, spectroscopy, signal processing and image processing, geophysics, engineering, physics, computer vision and differential equations.

The convolution can be defined for functions on Euclidean space and other groups (as algebraic structures). For example, periodic functions, such as the discrete-time Fourier transform, can be defined on a circle and convolved by periodic convolution. (See row 18 at .) A &quot;discrete convolution&quot; can be defined for functions on the set of integers.

Generalizations of convolution have applications in the field of numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra, and in the design and implementation of finite impulse response filters in signal processing.

Computing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as deconvolution.

== Definition ==

The convolution of formula_1 and formula_2 is written formula_13, denoting the operator with the symbol formula_14. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted. As such, it is a particular kind of integral transform:

:formula_15

An equivalent definition is (see commutativity):

:formula_16

While the symbol formula_17 is used above, it need not represent the time domain. At each formula_17, the convolution formula can be described as the area under the function formula_19 weighted by the function formula_20 shifted by the amount formula_17. As formula_17 changes, the weighting function formula_23 emphasizes different parts of the input function formula_19; If formula_17 is a positive value, then formula_23 is equal to formula_20 that slides or is shifted along the formula_28-axis toward the right (toward formula_29) by the amount of formula_17, while if formula_17 is a negative value, then formula_23 is equal to formula_20 that slides or is shifted toward the left (toward formula_34) by the amount of formula_35.

For functions formula_1, formula_2 supported on only formula_38 (i.e., zero for negative arguments), the integration limits can be truncated, resulting in:

:formula_39

For the multi-dimensional formulation of convolution, see &quot;domain of definition&quot; (below).

=== Notation ===

A common engineering notational convention is:

:formula_40

which has to be interpreted carefully to avoid confusion. For instance, formula_41 is equivalent to formula_42, but formula_43 is in fact equivalent to formula_44.

=== Relations with other transforms ===
Given two functions formula_45 and formula_46 with bilateral Laplace transforms (two-sided Laplace transform)

:formula_47

and

:formula_48

respectively, the convolution operation formula_49 can be defined as the inverse Laplace transform of the product of formula_50 and formula_51. More precisely,

:formula_52

Let formula_53, then

:formula_54

Note that formula_55 is the bilateral Laplace transform of formula_49. A similar derivation can be done using the unilateral Laplace transform (one-sided Laplace transform).

The convolution operation also describes the output (in terms of the input) of an important class of operations known as &quot;linear time-invariant&quot; (LTI). See LTI system theory for a derivation of convolution as the result of LTI constraints. In terms of the Fourier transforms of the input and output of an LTI operation, no new frequency components are created. The existing ones are only modified (amplitude and/or phase). In other words, the output transform is the pointwise product of the input transform with a third transform (known as a transfer function). See Convolution theorem for a derivation of that property of convolution. Conversely, convolution can be derived as the inverse Fourier transform of the pointwise product of two Fourier transforms.

== Visual explanation ==

== Historical developments ==
One of the earliest uses of the convolution integral appeared in D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s derivation of Taylor&#x27;s theorem in &quot;Recherches sur différents points importants du système du monde,&quot; published in 1754.

Also, an expression of the type:

:formula_57

is used by Sylvestre François Lacroix on page 505 of his book entitled &quot;Treatise on differences and series&quot;, which is the last of 3 volumes of the encyclopedic series: , Chez Courcier, Paris, 1797–1800. Soon thereafter, convolution operations appear in the works of Pierre Simon Laplace, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, Siméon Denis Poisson, and others. The term itself did not come into wide use until the 1950s or 1960s. Prior to that it was sometimes known as &quot;Faltung&quot; (which means &quot;folding&quot; in German), &quot;composition product&quot;, &quot;superposition integral&quot;, and &quot;Carson&#x27;s integral&quot;. Yet it appears as early as 1903, though the definition is rather unfamiliar in older uses.

The operation:

:formula_58

is a particular case of composition products considered by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra in 1913.

== Circular convolution ==
When a function formula_59 is periodic, with period formula_60, then for functions, formula_1, such that formula_62 exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:

:formula_63

where formula_64 is an arbitrary choice. The summation is called a periodic summation of the function formula_1.

When formula_59 is a periodic summation of another function, formula_2, then formula_68 is known as a &quot;circular&quot; or &quot;cyclic&quot; convolution of formula_1 and formula_2.

And if the periodic summation above is replaced by formula_71, the operation is called a &quot;periodic&quot; convolution of formula_71 and formula_59.

== Discrete convolution ==

For complex-valued functions formula_1 and formula_2 defined on the set formula_76 of integers, the &quot;discrete convolution&quot; of formula_1 and formula_2 is given by:

:formula_79

or equivalently (see commutativity) by:

:formula_80

The convolution of two finite sequences is defined by extending the sequences to finitely supported functions on the set of integers. When the sequences are the coefficients of two polynomials, then the coefficients of the ordinary product of the two polynomials are the convolution of the original two sequences. This is known as the Cauchy product of the coefficients of the sequences.

Thus when has finite support in the set formula_81 (representing, for instance, a finite impulse response), a finite summation may be used:
:formula_82

=== Circular discrete convolution ===
When a function formula_83 is periodic, with period formula_84 then for functions, formula_85 such that formula_86 exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:

:formula_87

The summation on formula_88 is called a periodic summation of the function formula_89

If formula_83 is a periodic summation of another function, formula_91 then formula_86 is known as a circular convolution of formula_1 and formula_94

When the non-zero durations of both formula_1 and formula_2 are limited to the interval formula_97  formula_86 reduces to these common forms:

The notation formula_99 for &quot;cyclic convolution&quot; denotes convolution over the cyclic group of integers modulo.

Circular convolution arises most often in the context of fast convolution with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.

=== Fast convolution algorithms ===

In many situations, discrete convolutions can be converted to circular convolutions so that fast transforms with a convolution property can be used to implement the computation. For example, convolution of digit sequences is the kernel operation in multiplication of multi-digit numbers, which can therefore be efficiently implemented with transform techniques (; ).

 requires arithmetic operations per output value and operations for outputs. That can be significantly reduced with any of several fast algorithms. Digital signal processing and other applications typically use fast convolution algorithms to reduce the cost of the convolution to O( log ) complexity.

The most common fast convolution algorithms use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms via the circular convolution theorem. Specifically, the circular convolution of two finite-length sequences is found by taking an FFT of each sequence, multiplying pointwise, and then performing an inverse FFT. Convolutions of the type defined above are then efficiently implemented using that technique in conjunction with zero-extension and/or discarding portions of the output. Other fast convolution algorithms, such as the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm or the Mersenne transform, use fast Fourier transforms in other rings. The Winograd method is used as an alternative to the FFT. It significantly speeds up 1D, 2D, and 3D convolution.

If one sequence is much longer than the other, zero-extension of the shorter sequence and fast circular convolution is not the most computationally efficient method available. Instead, decomposing the longer sequence into blocks and convolving each block allows for faster algorithms such as the overlap–save method and overlap–add method. A hybrid convolution method that combines block and FIR algorithms allows for a zero input-output latency that is useful for real-time convolution computations.

== Domain of definition ==

The convolution of two complex-valued functions on is itself a complex-valued function on , defined by:

:formula_100

and is well-defined only if and decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity in order for the integral to exist. Conditions for the existence of the convolution may be tricky, since a blow-up in at infinity can be easily offset by sufficiently rapid decay in . The question of existence thus may involve different conditions on and :

=== Compactly supported functions ===
If and are compactly supported continuous functions, then their convolution exists, and is also compactly supported and continuous . More generally, if either function (say ) is compactly supported and the other is locally integrable, then the convolution is well-defined and continuous.

Convolution of and is also well defined when both functions are locally square integrable on and supported on an interval of the form (or both supported on ).

=== Integrable functions ===
The convolution of and exists if and are both Lebesgue integrable functions in (), and in this case is also integrable . This is a consequence of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem. This is also true for functions in , under the discrete convolution, or more generally for the convolution on any group.

Likewise, if ()  and  ()  where ,  then  (),  and

:formula_101

In the particular case , this shows that is a Banach algebra under the convolution (and equality of the two sides holds if and are non-negative almost everywhere).
More generally, Young&#x27;s inequality implies that the convolution is a continuous bilinear map between suitable spaces. Specifically, if satisfy:

:formula_102

then

:formula_103

so that the convolution is a continuous bilinear mapping from to .
The Young inequality for convolution is also true in other contexts (circle group, convolution on ). The preceding inequality is not sharp on the real line: when , there exists a constant such that:

:formula_104

The optimal value of was discovered in 1975 and independently in 1976, see Brascamp–Lieb inequality.

A stronger estimate is true provided :
:formula_105
where formula_106 is the weak norm. Convolution also defines a bilinear continuous map formula_107 for formula_108, owing to the weak Young inequality:
:formula_109

=== Functions of rapid decay ===
In addition to compactly supported functions and integrable functions, functions that have sufficiently rapid decay at infinity can also be convolved. An important feature of the convolution is that if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; both decay rapidly, then &quot;f&quot;∗&quot;g&quot; also decays rapidly. In particular, if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are rapidly decreasing functions, then so is the convolution &quot;f&quot;∗&quot;g&quot;. Combined with the fact that convolution commutes with differentiation (see #Properties), it follows that the class of Schwartz functions is closed under convolution .

=== Distributions ===

If &quot;f&quot; is a smooth function that is compactly supported and &quot;g&quot; is a distribution, then &quot;f&quot;∗&quot;g&quot; is a smooth function defined by

:formula_110

More generally, it is possible to extend the definition of the convolution in a unique way with formula_111 the same as &quot;f&quot; above, so that the associative law

:formula_112

remains valid in the case where &quot;f&quot; is a distribution, and &quot;g&quot; a compactly supported distribution .

=== Measures ===

The convolution of any two Borel measures &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;ν&quot; of bounded variation is the measure formula_113 defined by 
:formula_114

In particular,
: formula_115

where formula_116 is a measurable set and formula_117 is the indicator function of formula_118.

This agrees with the convolution defined above when μ and ν are regarded as distributions, as well as the convolution of L1 functions when μ and ν are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

The convolution of measures also satisfies the following version of Young&#x27;s inequality
:formula_119
where the norm is the total variation of a measure. Because the space of measures of bounded variation is a Banach space, convolution of measures can be treated with standard methods of functional analysis that may not apply for the convolution of distributions.

== Properties ==

=== Algebraic properties ===

The convolution defines a product on the linear space of integrable functions. This product satisfies the following algebraic properties, which formally mean that the space of integrable functions with the product given by convolution is a commutative associative algebra without identity . Other linear spaces of functions, such as the space of continuous functions of compact support, are closed under the convolution, and so also form commutative associative algebras.

; Commutativity: formula_120 Proof: By definition: formula_121 Changing the variable of integration to formula_122 the result follows.

; Associativity: formula_123 Proof: This follows from using Fubini&#x27;s theorem (i.e., double integrals can be evaluated as iterated integrals in either order).

; Distributivity: formula_124 Proof: This follows from linearity of the integral.

; Associativity with scalar multiplication: formula_125 for any real (or complex) number formula_126.

; Multiplicative identity: No algebra of functions possesses an identity for the convolution. The lack of identity is typically not a major inconvenience, since most collections of functions on which the convolution is performed can be convolved with a delta distribution (a unitary impulse, centered at zero) or, at the very least (as is the case of &quot;L&quot;1) admit approximations to the identity. The linear space of compactly supported distributions does, however, admit an identity under the convolution. Specifically, formula_127 where &quot;δ&quot; is the delta distribution.

; Inverse element: Some distributions &quot;S&quot; have an inverse element &quot;S&quot;−1 for the convolution which then must satisfy formula_128 from which an explicit formula for &quot;S&quot;−1 may be obtained.The set of invertible distributions forms an abelian group under the convolution.

; Complex conjugation: formula_129

; Time reversal: If  formula_130  then  formula_131
Proof (using convolution theorem):

formula_132

formula_133

formula_134

; Relationship with differentiation: formula_135 Proof:
:formula_136

; Relationship with integration: If formula_137 and formula_138 then formula_139

=== Integration ===
If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are integrable functions, then the integral of their convolution on the whole space is simply obtained as the product of their integrals:
: formula_140

This follows from Fubini&#x27;s theorem. The same result holds if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are only assumed to be nonnegative measurable functions, by Tonelli&#x27;s theorem.

=== Differentiation ===
In the one-variable case,
: formula_141

where formula_142 is the derivative. More generally, in the case of functions of several variables, an analogous formula holds with the partial derivative:
: formula_143

A particular consequence of this is that the convolution can be viewed as a &quot;smoothing&quot; operation: the convolution of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is differentiable as many times as &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are in total.

These identities hold for example under the condition that &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are absolutely integrable and at least one of them has an absolutely integrable (L1) weak derivative, as a consequence of Young&#x27;s convolution inequality. For instance, when &quot;f&quot; is continuously differentiable with compact support, and &quot;g&quot; is an arbitrary locally integrable function,
: formula_144

These identities also hold much more broadly in the sense of tempered distributions if one of &quot;f&quot; or &quot;g&quot; is a 
rapidly decreasing tempered distribution, a 
compactly supported tempered distribution or a Schwartz function and the other is a tempered distribution. On the other hand, two positive integrable and infinitely differentiable functions may have a nowhere continuous convolution.

In the discrete case, the difference operator &quot;D&quot; &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1) − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) satisfies an analogous relationship:
: formula_145

=== Convolution theorem ===
The convolution theorem states that
: formula_146

where formula_147 denotes the Fourier transform of formula_1.

==== Convolution in other types of transformations ====

Versions of this theorem also hold for the Laplace transform, two-sided Laplace transform, Z-transform and Mellin transform.

==== Convolution on matrices ====

If formula_149 is the Fourier transform matrix, then
: formula_150,

where formula_151 is face-splitting product, formula_152 denotes Kronecker product, formula_153 denotes Hadamard product (this result is an evolving of count sketch properties).

This can be generalized for appropriate matrices formula_154:

: formula_155
from the properties of the face-splitting product.

=== Translational equivariance ===
The convolution commutes with translations, meaning that
: formula_156

where τ&quot;x&quot;f is the translation of the function &quot;f&quot; by &quot;x&quot; defined by
: formula_157

If &quot;f&quot; is a Schwartz function, then &quot;τxf&quot; is the convolution with a translated Dirac delta function &quot;τ&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;f&quot; = &quot;f&quot; ∗ &quot;τ&quot;&quot;x&quot; &quot;δ&quot;. So translation invariance of the convolution of Schwartz functions is a consequence of the associativity of convolution.

Furthermore, under certain conditions, convolution is the most general translation invariant operation. Informally speaking, the following holds
: Suppose that &quot;S&quot; is a bounded linear operator acting on functions which commutes with translations: &quot;S&quot;(&quot;τxf&quot;) = &quot;τx&quot;(&quot;Sf&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot;. Then &quot;S&quot; is given as convolution with a function (or distribution) &quot;g&quot;&quot;S&quot;; that is &quot;Sf&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;S&quot; ∗ &quot;f&quot;.

Thus some translation invariant operations can be represented as convolution. Convolutions play an important role in the study of time-invariant systems, and especially LTI system theory. The representing function &quot;g&quot;&quot;S&quot; is the impulse response of the transformation &quot;S&quot;.

A more precise version of the theorem quoted above requires specifying the class of functions on which the convolution is defined, and also requires assuming in addition that &quot;S&quot; must be a continuous linear operator with respect to the appropriate topology. It is known, for instance, that every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on &quot;L&quot;1 is the convolution with a finite Borel measure. More generally, every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; for 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞ is the convolution with a tempered distribution whose Fourier transform is bounded. To wit, they are all given by bounded Fourier multipliers.

== Convolutions on groups ==
If &quot;G&quot; is a suitable group endowed with a measure λ, and if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are real or complex valued integrable functions on &quot;G&quot;, then we can define their convolution by

:formula_158

It is not commutative in general. In typical cases of interest &quot;G&quot; is a locally compact Hausdorff topological group and λ is a (left-) Haar measure. In that case, unless &quot;G&quot; is unimodular, the convolution defined in this way is not the same as formula_159. The preference of one over the other is made so that convolution with a fixed function &quot;g&quot; commutes with left translation in the group:

:formula_160

Furthermore, the convention is also required for consistency with the definition of the convolution of measures given below. However, with a right instead of a left Haar measure, the latter integral is preferred over the former.

On locally compact abelian groups, a version of the convolution theorem holds: the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of the Fourier transforms. The circle group T with the Lebesgue measure is an immediate example. For a fixed &quot;g&quot; in &quot;L&quot;1(T), we have the following familiar operator acting on the Hilbert space &quot;L&quot;2(T):

:formula_161

The operator &quot;T&quot; is compact. A direct calculation shows that its adjoint &quot;T* &quot; is convolution with

:formula_162

By the commutativity property cited above, &quot;T&quot; is normal: &quot;T&quot;* &quot;T&quot; = &quot;TT&quot;* . Also, &quot;T&quot; commutes with the translation operators. Consider the family &quot;S&quot; of operators consisting of all such convolutions and the translation operators. Then &quot;S&quot; is a commuting family of normal operators. According to spectral theory, there exists an orthonormal basis {&quot;hk&quot;} that simultaneously diagonalizes &quot;S&quot;. This characterizes convolutions on the circle. Specifically, we have

:formula_163

which are precisely the characters of T. Each convolution is a compact multiplication operator in this basis. This can be viewed as a version of the convolution theorem discussed above.

A discrete example is a finite cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;. Convolution operators are here represented by circulant matrices, and can be diagonalized by the discrete Fourier transform.

A similar result holds for compact groups (not necessarily abelian): the matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional unitary representations form an orthonormal basis in &quot;L&quot;2 by the Peter–Weyl theorem, and an analog of the convolution theorem continues to hold, along with many other aspects of harmonic analysis that depend on the Fourier transform.

== Convolution of measures ==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a (multiplicatively written) topological group.
If μ and ν are Radon measures on &quot;G&quot;, then their convolution &quot;μ&quot;∗&quot;ν&quot; is defined as the pushforward measure of the group action and can be written as
:formula_164

for each measurable subset &quot;E&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. The convolution is also a Radon measure, whose total variation satisfies
:formula_165

In the case when &quot;G&quot; is locally compact with (left-)Haar measure λ, and μ and ν are absolutely continuous with respect to a λ, so that each has a density function, then the convolution μ∗ν is also absolutely continuous, and its density function is just the convolution of the two separate density functions. In fact, if &quot;either&quot; measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure, then so is their convolution.

If μ and ν are probability measures on the topological group then the convolution &quot;μ&quot;∗&quot;ν&quot; is the probability distribution of the sum &quot;X&quot; + &quot;Y&quot; of two independent random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; whose respective distributions are μ and ν.

== Infimal convolution ==
In convex analysis, the infimal convolution of proper (not identically formula_29) convex functions formula_167 on formula_168 is defined by:
formula_169
It can be shown that the infimal convolution of convex functions is convex. Furthermore, it satisfies an identity analogous to that of the Fourier transform of a traditional convolution, with the role of the Fourier transform is played instead by the Legendre transform:
formula_170
We have:
formula_171

== Bialgebras ==
Let (&quot;X&quot;, Δ, ∇, &quot;ε&quot;, &quot;η&quot;) be a bialgebra with comultiplication Δ, multiplication ∇, unit η, and counit &quot;ε&quot;. The convolution is a product defined on the endomorphism algebra End(&quot;X&quot;) as follows. Let &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;ψ&quot; ∈ End(&quot;X&quot;), that is, &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;ψ&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; are functions that respect all algebraic structure of &quot;X&quot;, then the convolution &quot;φ&quot;∗&quot;ψ&quot; is defined as the composition

:formula_172

The convolution appears notably in the definition of Hopf algebras . A bialgebra is a Hopf algebra if and only if it has an antipode: an endomorphism &quot;S&quot; such that
:formula_173

== Applications ==
Convolution and related operations are found in many applications in science, engineering and mathematics.
* Convolutional neural networks apply multiple cascaded &quot;convolution&quot; kernels with applications in machine vision and artificial intelligence. Though these are actually cross-correlations rather than convolutions in most cases.
* In non-neural-network-based image processing
** In digital image processing convolutional filtering plays an important role in many important algorithms in edge detection and related processes (see Kernel (image processing))
** In optics, an out-of-focus photograph is a convolution of the sharp image with a lens function. The photographic term for this is bokeh.
** In image processing applications such as adding blurring.
* In digital data processing
** In analytical chemistry, Savitzky–Golay smoothing filters are used for the analysis of spectroscopic data. They can improve signal-to-noise ratio with minimal distortion of the spectra
** In statistics, a weighted moving average is a convolution.
* In acoustics, reverberation is the convolution of the original sound with echoes from objects surrounding the sound source.
** In digital signal processing, convolution is used to map the impulse response of a real room on a digital audio signal.
** In electronic music convolution is the imposition of a spectral or rhythmic structure on a sound. Often this envelope or structure is taken from another sound. The convolution of two signals is the filtering of one through the other.
* In electrical engineering, the convolution of one function (the input signal) with a second function (the impulse response) gives the output of a linear time-invariant system (LTI). At any given moment, the output is an accumulated effect of all the prior values of the input function, with the most recent values typically having the most influence (expressed as a multiplicative factor). The impulse response function provides that factor as a function of the elapsed time since each input value occurred.
* In physics, wherever there is a linear system with a &quot;superposition principle&quot;, a convolution operation makes an appearance. For instance, in spectroscopy line broadening due to the Doppler effect on its own gives a Gaussian spectral line shape and collision broadening alone gives a Lorentzian line shape. When both effects are operative, the line shape is a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian, a Voigt function.
** In time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, the excitation signal can be treated as a chain of delta pulses, and the measured fluorescence is a sum of exponential decays from each delta pulse.
** In computational fluid dynamics, the large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model uses the convolution operation to lower the range of length scales necessary in computation thereby reducing computational cost.
* In probability theory, the probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of their individual distributions.
** In kernel density estimation, a distribution is estimated from sample points by convolution with a kernel, such as an isotropic Gaussian.
* In radiotherapy treatment planning systems, most part of all modern codes of calculation applies a convolution-superposition algorithm.
* In structural reliability, the reliability index can be defined based on the convolution theorem.
** The definition of reliability index for limit state functions with nonnormal distributions can be established corresponding to the joint distribution function. In fact, the joint distribution function can be obtained using the convolution theory.
* In Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, simulations of fluid dynamics are calculated using particles, each with surrounding kernels. For any given particle formula_174, some physical quantity formula_175 is calculated as a convolution of formula_176 with a weighting function, where formula_177 denotes the neighbors of particle formula_174: those that are located within its kernel. The convolution is approximated as a summation over each neighbor.
* In Fractional calculus convolution is instrumental in various definitions of fractional integral and fractional derivative.

<text>Calico (; in British usage since 1505) is a heavy plain-woven textile made from unbleached, and often not fully processed, cotton. It may also contain unseparated husk parts. The fabric is far coarser than muslin, but less coarse and thick than canvas or denim. However, it is still very cheap owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance.

The fabric was originally from the city of Calicut in southwestern India. It was made by the traditional weavers called cāliyans. The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues, and calico prints became popular in Europe.

==History==
===Origins===
Calico originated in Calicut, from which the name of the textile came, in South India, now Kerala, during the 11th century, where the cloth was known as &quot;chaliyan&quot;. It was mentioned in Indian literature by the 12th century when the polymath and writer Hemachandra described calico fabric prints with a lotus design. Calico was woven using Gujarati cotton from Surat for both the warp and weft. By the 15th century, calico from Gujarat made its appearance in Cairo, then capital of the Egypt Eyalet under the Ottoman Empire. Trade with Europe followed from the 17th century onwards.

===Politics of cotton in the British Empire===
In the 18th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry, centered in the east and south in towns such as Norwich, jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701, only of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindustān (India), had become popular. In 1700 the first of the Calico Acts was passed to prevent the import of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead — calico that had not been finished-dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as fustian, which they sent to London for finishing. Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Coventry woollen manufacturers claimed that the imports were taking jobs away from their workers. The Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 was passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins, but neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton weft with linen warp were specifically permitted by the 1736 Manchester Act.

In 1764, of cottonwool was imported.

===Calico printing===
Early Indian chintz, that is, glazed calico with a large floral pattern, was primarily produced using painting techniques. Later, the hues were applied by wooden blocks, and the cloth manufacturers in Britain printed calico using wooden block printing. Calico printers at work are depicted in one of the stained glass windows made by Stephen Adam for the Maryhill Burgh Halls, Glasgow. Confusingly, linen and silk printed this way were known as &quot;linen calicoes&quot; and &quot;silk calicoes&quot;. Early European calicoes (1680) were cheap plain weave white cotton fabric, or cream or unbleached cotton, with a design block-printed using a single alizarin dye fixed with two mordants, giving a red and black pattern. Polychromatic prints were possible, using two sets of blocks and an additional blue dye. The Indian taste was for dark printed backgrounds, while the European market preferred a pattern on a cream base. As the century progressed the European preference moved from the large chintz patterns to smaller, tighter patterns.

Thomas Bell patented a printing technique in 1783 that used copper rollers. In 1785, Livesey, Hargreaves and Company put the first machine that used this technique into operation in Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire. The production volume for printed cloth in Lancashire in 1750 was estimated at 50,000 pieces of ; in 1850, it was 20,000,000 pieces. The commercial method of calico printing using engraved rollers was invented in 1821 in New Mills, Derbyshire, in the United Kingdom. John Potts of Potts, Oliver and Potts used a copper-engraved master to produce rollers to transfer the inks. After 1888, block printing was only used for short-run specialized jobs. After 1880, profits from printing fell due to overcapacity and the firms started to form combines. In the first, three Scottish firms formed the United Turkey Red Co. Ltd in 1897, and the second, in 1899, was the much larger Calico Printers&#x27; Association 46 printing concerns and 13 merchants combined, representing 85% of the British printing capacity. Some of this capacity was removed and in 1901 Calico had 48% of the printing trade. In 1916, they and the other printers formed and joined a trade association, which then set minimum prices for each &#x27;price section&#x27; of the industry.

The trade association remained in operation until 1954, when the arrangement was challenged by the government Monopolies Commission. Over the intervening period much trade had been lost overseas.

==Terminology==

In the UK, Australia and New Zealand:
*Calico – simple, cheap equal weft and warp plain weave fabric in white, cream or unbleached cotton
*Calico bag - a bag made of calico used by banks and other financial institutions

In the US:
*Calico – cotton fabric with a small, all-over floral print
*Muslin – UK: muslin gauze – simple, cheap equal weft and warp plain weave fabric in white, cream or unbleached cotton and/or a very fine, light plain weave cotton fabric
*Muslin gauze – the very lightest, most open weave of muslin
*Gauze – UK: cheesecloth – any very light fabric, generally with a plain weave

Printed calico was imported into the United States from Lancashire in the 1780s, and here a linguistic separation occurred. While Europe maintained the word calico for the fabric, in the States it was used to refer to the printed design.

These colourful, small-patterned printed fabrics gave rise to the use of the word calico to describe a cat coat colour: calico cat. The patterned fabric also gave its name to two species of North American crabs; see Ovalipes ocellatus.

<doc id="7522" wikidata="Q634314" url="?curid=7522" title="Calorimetry">
<text>In chemistry and thermodynamics, calorimetry () is the science or act of measuring changes in &quot;state variables&quot; of a body for the purpose of deriving the heat transfer associated with changes of its state due, for example, to chemical reactions, physical changes, or phase transitions under specified constraints. Calorimetry is performed with a calorimeter. Scottish physician and scientist Joseph Black, who was the first to recognize the distinction between heat and temperature, is said to be the founder of the science of calorimetry.

Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce by measuring either their production of carbon dioxide and nitrogen waste (frequently ammonia in aquatic organisms, or urea in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of oxygen. Lavoisier noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption this way, using multiple regression. The dynamic energy budget theory explains why this procedure is correct. Heat generated by living organisms may also be measured by &quot;direct calorimetry&quot;, in which the entire organism is placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement.

A widely used modern instrument is the differential scanning calorimeter, a device which allows thermal data to be obtained on small amounts of material. It involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and recording the heat flow either into or from the specimen.

==Classical calorimetric calculation of heat==

===Cases with differentiable equation of state for a one-component body===

====Basic classical calculation with respect to volume====

Calorimetry requires that a reference material that changes temperature have known definite thermal constitutive properties. The classical rule, recognized by Clausius and Kelvin, is that the pressure exerted by the calorimetric material is fully and rapidly determined solely by its temperature and volume; this rule is for changes that do not involve phase change, such as melting of ice. There are many materials that do not comply with this rule, and for them, the present formula of classical calorimetry does not provide an adequate account. Here the classical rule is assumed to hold for the calorimetric material being used, and the propositions are mathematically written:

The thermal response of the calorimetric material is fully described by its pressure formula_1 as the value of its constitutive function formula_2 of just the volume formula_3 and the temperature formula_4. All increments are here required to be very small. This calculation refers to a domain of volume and temperature of the body in which no phase change occurs, and there is only one phase present. An important assumption here is continuity of property relations. A different analysis is needed for phase change

When a small increment of heat is gained by a calorimetric body, with small increments, formula_5 of its volume, and formula_6 of its temperature, the increment of heat, formula_7, gained by the body of calorimetric material, is given by

:formula_8

where

:formula_9 denotes the latent heat with respect to volume, of the calorimetric material at constant controlled temperature formula_10. The surroundings&#x27; pressure on the material is instrumentally adjusted to impose a chosen volume change, with initial volume formula_3. To determine this latent heat, the volume change is effectively the independently instrumentally varied quantity. This latent heat is not one of the widely used ones, but is of theoretical or conceptual interest.
:formula_12 denotes the heat capacity, of the calorimetric material at fixed constant volume formula_3, while the pressure of the material is allowed to vary freely, with initial temperature formula_4. The temperature is forced to change by exposure to a suitable heat bath. It is customary to write formula_12 simply as formula_16, or even more briefly as formula_17. This latent heat is one of the two widely used ones.

The latent heat with respect to volume is the heat required for unit increment in volume at constant temperature. It can be said to be &#x27;measured along an isotherm&#x27;, and the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely, according to its constitutive law formula_18. For a given material, it can have a positive or negative sign or exceptionally it can be zero, and this can depend on the temperature, as it does for water about 4 C. The concept of latent heat with respect to volume was perhaps first recognized by Joseph Black in 1762. The term &#x27;latent heat of expansion&#x27; is also used. The latent heat with respect to volume can also be called the &#x27;latent energy with respect to volume&#x27;. For all of these usages of &#x27;latent heat&#x27;, a more systematic terminology uses &#x27;latent heat capacity&#x27;.

The heat capacity at constant volume is the heat required for unit increment in temperature at constant volume. It can be said to be &#x27;measured along an isochor&#x27;, and again, the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. It always has a positive sign. This means that for an increase in the temperature of a body without change of its volume, heat must be supplied to it. This is consistent with common experience.

Quantities like formula_7 are sometimes called &#x27;curve differentials&#x27;, because they are measured along curves in the formula_20 surface.

====Classical theory for constant-volume (isochoric) calorimetry====
Constant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter. Heat is still measured by the above-stated principle of calorimetry.

This means that in a suitably constructed calorimeter, called a bomb calorimeter, the increment of volume formula_5 can be made to vanish, formula_22. For constant-volume calorimetry:

:formula_23

where

:formula_6 denotes the increment in temperature and
:formula_17 denotes the heat capacity at constant volume.

====Classical heat calculation with respect to pressure====

From the above rule of calculation of heat with respect to volume, there follows one with respect to pressure.

In a process of small increments, formula_26 of its pressure, and formula_6 of its temperature, the increment of heat, formula_7, gained by the body of calorimetric material, is given by

:formula_29

where

:formula_30 denotes the latent heat with respect to pressure, of the calorimetric material at constant temperature, while the volume and pressure of the body are allowed to vary freely, at pressure formula_1 and temperature formula_4;
:formula_33 denotes the heat capacity, of the calorimetric material at constant pressure, while the temperature and volume of the body are allowed to vary freely, at pressure formula_1 and temperature formula_4. It is customary to write formula_33 simply as formula_37, or even more briefly as formula_38.

The new quantities here are related to the previous ones:

:formula_39

:formula_40
where
:formula_41 denotes the partial derivative of formula_2 with respect to formula_3 evaluated for formula_20

and

:formula_45 denotes the partial derivative of formula_2 with respect to formula_4 evaluated for formula_20.

The latent heats formula_9 and formula_30 are always of opposite sign.

It is common to refer to the ratio of specific heats as

:formula_51 often just written as formula_52.

===Calorimetry through phase change, equation of state shows one jump discontinuity===

An early calorimeter was that used by Laplace and Lavoisier, as shown in the figure above. It worked at constant temperature, and at atmospheric pressure. The latent heat involved was then not a latent heat with respect to volume or with respect to pressure, as in the above account for calorimetry without phase change. The latent heat involved in this calorimeter was with respect to phase change, naturally occurring at constant temperature. This kind of calorimeter worked by measurement of mass of water produced by the melting of ice, which is a phase change.

===Cumulation of heating===

For a time-dependent process of heating of the calorimetric material, defined by a continuous joint progression formula_53 of formula_54 and formula_55, starting at time formula_56 and ending at time formula_57, there can be calculated an accumulated quantity of heat delivered, formula_58 . This calculation is done by mathematical integration along the progression with respect to time. This is because increments of heat are &#x27;additive&#x27;; but this does not mean that heat is a conservative quantity. The idea that heat was a conservative quantity was invented by Lavoisier, and is called the &#x27;caloric theory&#x27;; by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as mistaken. Written with the symbol formula_59, the quantity formula_58 is not at all restricted to be an increment with very small values; this is in contrast with formula_7.

One can write

:formula_62

::formula_63

::formula_64.

This expression uses quantities such as formula_65 which are defined in the section below headed &#x27;Mathematical aspects of the above rules&#x27;.

===Mathematical aspects of the above rules===

The use of &#x27;very small&#x27; quantities such as formula_7 is related to the physical requirement for the quantity formula_2 to be &#x27;rapidly determined&#x27; by formula_3 and formula_4; such &#x27;rapid determination&#x27; refers to a physical process. These &#x27;very small&#x27; quantities are used in the Leibniz approach to the infinitesimal calculus. The Newton approach uses instead &#x27;fluxions&#x27; such as formula_70, which makes it more obvious that formula_2 must be &#x27;rapidly determined&#x27;.

In terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be written

:formula_72

where

:formula_73 denotes the time

:formula_65 denotes the time rate of heating of the calorimetric material at time formula_73

:formula_76 denotes the time rate of change of volume of the calorimetric material at time formula_73

:formula_78 denotes the time rate of change of temperature of the calorimetric material.

The increment formula_7 and the fluxion formula_65 are obtained for a particular time formula_73 that determines the values of the quantities on the righthand sides of the above rules. But this is not a reason to expect that there should exist a mathematical function formula_82. For this reason, the increment formula_7 is said to be an &#x27;imperfect differential&#x27; or an &#x27;inexact differential&#x27;. Some books indicate this by writing formula_84 instead of formula_7. Also, the notation &quot;đQ&quot; is used in some books. Carelessness about this can lead to error.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck 1923/1926 57&quot;&gt;Planck, M. (1923/1926), page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity formula_62 is properly said to be a functional of the continuous joint progression formula_53 of formula_54 and formula_55, but, in the mathematical definition of a function, formula_62 is not a function of formula_20. Although the fluxion formula_65 is defined here as a function of time formula_73, the symbols formula_94 and formula_82 respectively standing alone are not defined here.

===Physical scope of the above rules of calorimetry===

The above rules refer only to suitable calorimetric materials. The terms &#x27;rapidly&#x27; and &#x27;very small&#x27; call for empirical physical checking of the domain of validity of the above rules.

The above rules for the calculation of heat belong to pure calorimetry. They make no reference to thermodynamics, and were mostly understood before the advent of thermodynamics. They are the basis of the &#x27;thermo&#x27; contribution to thermodynamics. The &#x27;dynamics&#x27; contribution is based on the idea of work, which is not used in the above rules of calculation.

==Experimentally conveniently measured coefficients==

Empirically, it is convenient to measure properties of calorimetric materials under experimentally controlled conditions.

===Pressure increase at constant volume===

For measurements at experimentally controlled volume, one can use the assumption, stated above, that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is can be expressed as a function of its volume and temperature.

For measurement at constant experimentally controlled volume, the isochoric coefficient of pressure rise with temperature, is defined by 

:formula_96

===Expansion at constant pressure===

For measurements at experimentally controlled pressure, it is assumed that the volume formula_3 of the body of calorimetric material can be expressed as a function formula_98 of its temperature formula_4 and pressure formula_1. This assumption is related to, but is not the same as, the above used assumption that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is known as a function of its volume and temperature; anomalous behaviour of materials can affect this relation.

The quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled pressure, the isobar volume expansion coefficient, is defined by 

:formula_101

===Compressibility at constant temperature===

For measurements at experimentally controlled temperature, it is again assumed that the volume formula_3 of the body of calorimetric material can be expressed as a function formula_98 of its temperature formula_4 and pressure formula_1, with the same provisos as mentioned just above.

The quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled temperature, the isothermal compressibility, is defined by 

:formula_106

==Relation between classical calorimetric quantities==

Assuming that the rule formula_18 is known, one can derive the function of formula_108 that is used above in the classical heat calculation with respect to pressure. This function can be found experimentally from the coefficients formula_109 and formula_110 through the mathematically deducible relation

:formula_111.

==Connection between calorimetry and thermodynamics==

Thermodynamics developed gradually over the first half of the nineteenth century, building on the above theory of calorimetry which had been worked out before it, and on other discoveries. According to Gislason and Craig (2005): &quot;Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry...&quot; According to Kondepudi (2008): &quot;Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories.&quot;

In terms of thermodynamics, the internal energy formula_112 of the calorimetric material can be considered as the value of a function formula_113 of formula_20, with partial derivatives formula_115 and formula_116.

Then it can be shown that one can write a thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

:formula_117

with

:formula_118

and

:formula_119 .

Again, further in terms of thermodynamics, the internal energy formula_112 of the calorimetric material can sometimes, depending on the calorimetric material, be considered as the value of a function formula_121 of formula_122, with partial derivatives formula_123 and formula_116, and with formula_3 being expressible as the value of a function formula_126 of formula_122, with partial derivatives formula_128 and formula_129 .

Then, according to Adkins (1975), it can be shown that one can write a further thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:

:formula_130

with

:formula_131

and

:formula_132 .

Beyond the calorimetric fact noted above that the latent heats formula_9 and formula_30 are always of opposite sign, it may be shown, using the thermodynamic concept of work, that also

:formula_135

==Special interest of thermodynamics in calorimetry: the isothermal segments of a Carnot cycle==

Calorimetry has a special benefit for thermodynamics. It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a Carnot cycle.

A Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:

(1) a change in volume from a volume formula_136 to a volume formula_137 at constant temperature formula_138 so as to incur a flow of heat into the body (known as an isothermal change)

(2) a change in volume from formula_137 to a volume formula_140 at a variable temperature just such as to incur no flow of heat (known as an adiabatic change)

(3) another isothermal change in volume from formula_140 to a volume formula_142 at constant temperature formula_143 such as to incur a flow or heat out of the body and just such as to precisely prepare for the following change

(4) another adiabatic change of volume from formula_142 back to formula_136 just such as to return the body to its starting temperature formula_138.

In isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by

:   formula_147

and in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by

:formula_148.

Because the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by

:formula_149.

This quantity is used by thermodynamics and is related in a special way to the net work done by the body during the Carnot cycle. The net change of the body&#x27;s internal energy during the Carnot cycle, formula_150, is equal to zero, because the material of the working body has the special properties noted above.

==Special interest of calorimetry in thermodynamics: relations between classical calorimetric quantities==

===Relation of latent heat with respect to volume, and the equation of state===

The quantity formula_9, the latent heat with respect to volume, belongs to classical calorimetry. It accounts for the occurrence of energy transfer by work in a process in which heat is also transferred; the quantity, however, was considered before the relation between heat and work transfers was clarified by the invention of thermodynamics. In the light of thermodynamics, the classical calorimetric quantity is revealed as being tightly linked to the calorimetric material&#x27;s equation of state formula_18. Provided that the temperature formula_153 is measured in the thermodynamic absolute scale, the relation is expressed in the formula

:formula_154.

===Difference of specific heats===

Advanced thermodynamics provides the relation

:formula_155.

From this, further mathematical and thermodynamic reasoning leads to another relation between classical calorimetric quantities. The difference of specific heats is given by

:formula_156.

==Practical constant-volume calorimetry (bomb calorimetry) for thermodynamic studies==
Constant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter.

No work is performed in constant-volume calorimetry, so the heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system. The heat capacity at constant volume is assumed to be independent of temperature.

Heat is measured by the principle of calorimetry.

:formula_157

where

:Δ&quot;U&quot; is change in internal energy,
:Δ&quot;T&quot; is change in temperature and
:&quot;CV&quot; is the heat capacity at constant volume.
In &quot;constant-volume calorimetry&quot; the pressure is not held constant. If there is a pressure difference between initial and final states, the heat measured needs adjustment to provide the &quot;enthalpy change&quot;. One then has
:formula_158

where

:Δ&quot;H&quot; is change in enthalpy and
:&quot;V&quot; is the unchanging volume of the sample chamber.

<doc id="7525" wikidata="Q313252" url="?curid=7525" title="Charles Evans Hughes">
<text>Charles Evans Hughes (April 11, 1862 – August 27, 1948) was an American politician, academic, and jurist who served as the 11th chief justice of the United States from 1930 to 1941. A member of the Republican Party, he previously was the 36th governor of New York (1907–1910), an associate justice of the Supreme Court (1910–1916), and 44th U.S. secretary of state (1921–1925). As the Republican nominee in the 1916 presidential election, he narrowly lost to Woodrow Wilson.

Born to a Welsh immigrant preacher and his wife in Glens Falls, New York, Hughes graduated from Brown University and Columbia Law School and practiced law in New York City. After working in private practice for several years, in 1905 he led successful state investigations into public utilities and the life insurance industry. He won election as the governor of New York in 1906, and implemented several progressive reforms. In 1910, President William Howard Taft appointed Hughes as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Hughes often joined Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in voting to uphold state and federal regulations.

Hughes served as an associate justice until 1916, when he resigned from the bench to accept the Republican presidential nomination. Though Hughes was widely viewed as the favorite in the race against incumbent Democratic president Woodrow Wilson, Wilson won a narrow victory. After Warren G. Harding won the 1920 presidential election, Hughes accepted Harding&#x27;s invitation to serve as secretary of state. Serving under Harding and Calvin Coolidge, he negotiated the Washington Naval Treaty, which was designed to prevent a naval arms race among the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Hughes left office in 1925 and returned to private practice, becoming one of the most prominent attorneys in the country.

In 1930, President Herbert Hoover appointed him to succeed Chief Justice Taft. Along with Associate Justice Owen Roberts, Hughes emerged as a key swing vote on the bench, positioned between the liberal Three Musketeers and the conservative Four Horsemen. The Hughes Court struck down several New Deal programs in the early and the mid-1930s; 1937 marked a turning point for the Supreme Court and the New Deal as Hughes and Roberts joined with the Three Musketeers to uphold the Wagner Act and a state minimum wage law. That same year saw the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. Hughes served until 1941, when he retired and was succeeded by Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone.

==Early life and family==
Hughes&#x27;s father, David Charles Hughes, was Welsh. He immigrated to the United States from Wales in 1855 after he was inspired by &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot;. David became a Baptist preacher in Glens Falls, New York, and married Mary Catherine Connelly, whose family had been in the United States for several generations. Charles Evans Hughes, the only child of David and Mary, was born in Glens Falls on April 11, 1862. The Hughes family moved to Oswego, New York, in 1866, but relocated soon after to Newark, New Jersey, and then to Brooklyn. With the exception of a brief period of attendance at Newark High School, Hughes received no formal education until 1874, instead being educated by his parents. In September 1874, he enrolled in New York City&#x27;s prestigious Public School 35, graduating the following year.

At the age of 14, Hughes attended Madison University (now Colgate University) for two years before transferring to Brown University. He graduated from Brown third in his class at the age of 19, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year. He was also a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, where he served as the first international President later on. During his time at Brown, Hughes volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican nominee James A. Garfield in the 1880 presidential election, a fraternity brother of his in Delta Upsilon where Garfield was an undergraduate at Williams College, and served as the editor of the college newspaper. After graduating from Brown, Hughes spent a year working as a teacher in Delhi, New York. He then enrolled in Columbia Law School, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1884 ranked first in his class. That same year, he passed the New York bar exam with the highest score ever awarded.

In 1888, Hughes married Antoinette Carter, the daughter of the senior partner of the law firm where he worked. Their first child, Charles Evans Hughes Jr., was born the following year, and Hughes purchased a house in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side neighborhood. Hughes and his wife had one son and three daughters. Their youngest child, Elizabeth Hughes, was one of the first humans injected with insulin, and later served as president of the Supreme Court Historical Society.

==Legal and academic career==
Hughes took a position with the Wall Street law firm of Chamberlain, Carter &amp; Hornblower in 1883, focusing primarily on matters related to contracts and bankruptcies. He was made a partner in the firm in 1888, and the firm changed its name to Carter, Hughes &amp; Cravath (it later became known as Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed). Hughes left the firm and became a professor at Cornell Law School from 1891 to 1893. He returned to Carter, Hughes &amp; Cravath in 1893. He also joined the board of Brown University and served on a special committee that recommended revisions to New York&#x27;s Code of Civil Procedure.

===Exposing corrupt utilities===
Responding to newspaper stories run by the &quot;New York World&quot;, Governor Frank W. Higgins appointed a legislative committee to investigate the state&#x27;s public utilities in 1905. On the recommendation of a former state judge who had been impressed by Hughes&#x27;s performance in court, the legislative committee appointed Hughes to lead the investigation. Hughes was reluctant to take on the powerful utility companies, but Senator Frederick C. Stevens, the leader of the committee, convinced Hughes to accept the position. Hughes decided to center his investigation on Consolidated Gas, which controlled the production and sale of gas in New York City. Though few expected the committee to have any impact on public corruption, Hughes was able to show that Consolidated Gas had engaged in a pattern of tax evasion and fraudulent bookkeeping. To eliminate or mitigate those abuses, Hughes drafted and convinced the state legislature to pass bills that established a commission to regulate public utilities and lowered gas prices.

===Exposing corrupt insurance companies===

Hughes&#x27;s success made him a popular public figure in New York, and he was appointed counsel to the Armstrong Insurance Commission, which investigated the major life insurance companies headquartered in New York. His examination of the insurance industry uncovered payments made to journalists and lobbyists as well as payments and other forms of compensation directed to legislators serving throughout the country. His investigation also showed that many top insurance executives had various conflicts of interest and had received huge raises at the same time that dividends to policyholders had fallen. Seeking to remove Hughes from the investigation, Republican leaders nominated him as the party&#x27;s candidate for Mayor of New York City, but Hughes refused the nomination. His efforts ultimately resulted in the resignation or firing of most of the top-ranking officials in the three major life insurance companies in the United States. Following the investigation, Hughes convinced the state legislature to bar insurance companies from owning corporate stock, underwriting securities, or engaging in other banking practices.

==Governor of New York==
Seeking a strong candidate to defeat newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst in the 1906 New York gubernatorial election, President Theodore Roosevelt convinced New York Republican leaders to nominate Hughes for governor. A progressive conservative, Roosevelt described Hughes as &quot;a sane and sincere reformer, who really has fought against the very evils which Hearst denounces, ... [but is] free from any taint of demagogy.&quot; In his campaign for governor, Hughes attacked the corruption of specific companies but defended corporations as a necessary part of the economy. He also called for an eight-hour workday on public works projects and favored prohibitions on child labor. Hughes was not a charismatic speaker, but he campaigned vigorously throughout the state and won the endorsements of most newspapers. Ultimately, Hughes defeated Hearst in a close election, taking 52 percent of the vote.

===Reforming state government===

Hughes&#x27;s governorship focused largely on reforming the government and addressing political corruption. He expanded the number of civil service positions, increased the power of the public utility regulatory commissions, and won passage of laws that placed limits on political donations by corporations and required political candidates to track campaign receipts and expenditures. He also signed laws that barred younger workers from several dangerous occupations and established a maximum 48-hour workweek for manufacturing workers under the age of 16. To enforce those laws, Hughes reorganized the New York State Department of Labor. Hughes&#x27;s labor policies were influenced by economist Richard T. Ely, who sought to improve working conditions for laborers, but rejected the more far-reaching reforms favored by union leaders like Samuel Gompers.

===Organizing the Baptists===

The busy governor found time to get involved in religious matters. A lifelong Northern Baptist, Hughes participated in the creation of the Northern Baptist Convention in May 1907. Hughes served the convention as its first president, beginning the task of unifying the thousands of independent Baptist churches across the North into one denomination. Previously, northern Baptists had only connected between local churches through mission societies and benevolent causes. The Northern Baptist Convention went on to become the historically important American Baptist Churches USA, which made this aspect of Hughes&#x27;s life during his governorship a key part of his historical influence.

===Disappointing second term as governor===

However, Hughes&#x27;s political role was changing. He had previously been close with Roosevelt, but relations between Hughes and the president cooled after a dispute over a minor federal appointment. Roosevelt chose not to seek re-election in 1908, instead endorsing Secretary of War William Howard Taft as his preferred successor. Taft won the Republican presidential nomination and asked Hughes to serve as his running mate, but Hughes declined the offer. Hughes also considered retiring from the governorship, but Taft and Roosevelt convinced him to seek a second term. Despite having little support among some of the more conservative leaders of the state party, Hughes won re-election in the 1908 election. Hughes&#x27;s second term proved to be less successful than his first. His highest priority was a direct primary law, and it repeatedly failed to pass. He did obtain increased regulation over telephone and telegraph companies and won passage of the first workers&#x27; compensation bill in U.S. history.

According to historian and journalist Henry F. Pringle, Hughes&#x27;s sense of civic duty was a poor fit in a party-machine age, leaving &quot;many faithful Republicans&quot; with bitter memories of Hughes&#x27;s &quot;horrid notions of efficiency in government&quot; that &quot;ruthlessly disregarded necessary rewards for party workers.&quot;

==Associate Justice==
By early 1910, Hughes was anxious to retire from his position as governor. A vacancy on the Supreme Court arose following the death of Associate Justice David J. Brewer, and Taft offered the position to Hughes, who quickly accepted the offer. His nomination was formally received by the Senate on April 25, 1910. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably on his nomination on May 2, 1910, and the Senate unanimously confirmed him the same day. Two months after Hughes&#x27;s confirmation, but prior to his taking the judicial oath, Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller died. Taft elevated Associate Justice Edward Douglass White to the position of Chief Justice despite having previously indicated to Hughes that he might select Hughes as Chief Justice. White&#x27;s candidacy for the position was bolstered by his long experience on the bench and popularity among his fellow justices, as well as Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s coolness towards Hughes.

Hughes was sworn in to the Supreme Court on October 10, 1910, and quickly struck up friendships with other members of the Court, including Chief Justice White, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, and Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. In the disposition of cases, however, Hughes tended to align with Holmes. He voted to uphold state laws providing for minimum wages, workmen&#x27;s compensation, and maximum work hours for women and children. He also wrote several opinions upholding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. His majority opinion in &quot;Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad vs. Interstate Commerce Commission&quot; upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers. His majority opinion in the 1914 Shreveport Rate Case upheld the Interstate Commerce Commission&#x27;s decision to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce, though Hughes avoided directly overruling the 1895 case of &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot;

He also wrote a series of opinions that upheld civil liberties; in one such case, &quot;McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.&quot;, Hughes&#x27;s majority opinion required railroad carriers to give African-Americans &quot;equal treatment.&quot; Hughes&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Bailey v. Alabama&quot; invalidated a state law that had made it a crime for a laborer to fail to complete obligations agreed to in a labor contract. Hughes held that this law violated the Thirteenth Amendment and discriminated against African-American workers. He also joined the majority decision in the 1915 case of &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot;, which outlawed the use of grandfather clauses to determine voter enfranchisement. Hughes and Holmes were the only dissenters from the court&#x27;s ruling that affirmed a lower court&#x27;s decision to withhold a writ of habeas corpus from Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager convicted of murder in the state of Georgia.

==Presidential candidate==

Taft and Roosevelt endured a bitter split during Taft&#x27;s presidency, and Roosevelt challenged Taft for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. Taft won re-nomination, but Roosevelt ran on the ticket of a third party, the Progressive Party. With the split in the Republican Party, Democratic Governor Woodrow Wilson defeated Taft and Roosevelt in the 1912 presidential election and enacted his progressive New Freedom agenda. Seeking to bridge the divide in the Republican Party and limit Wilson to a single term, several Republican leaders asked Hughes to consider running in the 1916 presidential election. Hughes at first rebuffed those entreaties, but his potential candidacy became the subject of widespread speculation and polls showed that he was the preferred candidate of many Republican voters.

By the time of the June 1916 Republican National Convention, Hughes had won two presidential primaries, and his backers had lined up the support of numerous delegates. Hughes led on the first presidential ballot of the convention and clinched the nomination on the third ballot. Hughes accepted the nomination, becoming the first and only sitting Supreme Court Justice to serve as a major party&#x27;s presidential nominee, and submitted his resignation to President Wilson. Roosevelt, meanwhile, declined to run again on a third party ticket, leaving Hughes and Wilson as the only major candidates in the race.

Because of the Republican Party&#x27;s dominance in presidential elections held since the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Hughes was widely regarded as the favorite even though Wilson was the incumbent. His candidacy was further boosted by his own reputation for intelligence, personal integrity, and moderation. Hughes also won the public support of both Taft and Roosevelt, though Roosevelt remained uneasy with Hughes, who he feared would be a &quot;Wilson with whiskers.&quot; However, the 1912 split in Republican ranks remained a lingering issue, and Hughes damaged his campaign by deciding to base his California campaign with the conservative Republican regulars. Hiram Johnson, the Governor of California who had been Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the 1912 election, endorsed Hughes but the Progressive forces ignored Hughes. Nationally, because of Hughes&#x27;s opposition to the Adamson Act and the Sixteenth Amendment, most former Progressive Party leaders endorsed Wilson. By election day, Hughes was still generally considered to be the favorite. He performed strongly in the Northeast and early election returns looked good. Nevertheless, Woodrow Wilson, as expected, swept the Solid South while also winning several states in the Midwest and Great Plains, where his candidacy was boosted by a strong antiwar sentiment. Wilson ultimately prevailed after winning the decisive state of California by fewer than 4,000 votes.

===Return to law practice and political advising===
After the election, Hughes turned down offers from larger organizations and returned to his small law firm, now known as Hughes, Rounds, Schurman &amp; Dwight. In March 1917, Hughes joined with many other Republican leaders in demanding that Wilson declare war on the Central Powers after Germany sank several American merchant ships. The next month, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, and the United States entered World War I. Hughes supported Wilson&#x27;s military policies, including the imposition of the draft, and he served as chairman of New York City&#x27;s draft appeals board. He also investigated the aircraft industry on behalf of the Wilson administration, exposing numerous inefficiencies. He once again returned to private practice after the war, serving a wide array of clients, including five Socialists who had been expelled from the New York legislature for their political beliefs. He sought to broker a compromise between President Wilson and Senate Republicans regarding US entrance into Wilson&#x27;s proposed League of Nations, but the Senate rejected the League and the Treaty of Versailles.

With Wilson&#x27;s popularity declining, many Republican leaders believed that their party would win the 1920 presidential election. Hughes remained popular in the party, and many influential Republicans favored him as the party&#x27;s candidate in 1920. Hughes was struck by personal tragedy when his daughter, Helen, died in 1920 of tuberculosis, and he refused to allow his name to be considered for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention. The party instead nominated a ticket consisting of Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio and Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts. The Republican ticket won in a landslide, taking 61 percent of the popular vote.

==Secretary of State==

Shortly after Harding&#x27;s victory in the 1920 election, Hughes accepted the position of Secretary of State. After the death of Chief Justice White in May 1921, Hughes was mentioned as a potential successor. Hughes told Harding he was uninterested in leaving the State Department, and Harding instead appointed former President Taft as the Chief Justice.

Harding granted Hughes a great deal of discretion in his leadership of the State Department and US foreign policy. Harding and Hughes frequently communicated, Hughes worked within some broad outlines, and the president remained well-informed. However, the President rarely overrode any of Hughes&#x27;s decisions, with the big and obvious exception of the League of Nations.

After taking office, President Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations to deciding the US would not join even a scaled-down version. Another view is that Harding favored joining with reservations when he assumed office on March 4, 1921, but senators staunchly opposed (the &quot;Irreconcilables&quot;), per Ronald E. Powaski&#x27;s 1991 book, &quot;threatened to wreck the new administration.&quot;

Hughes favored membership in the League. Early in his tenure as Secretary of State, he asked the Senate to vote on the Treaty of Versailles, but he yielded to either Harding&#x27;s changing views and/or the political reality within the Senate. Instead, he convinced Harding of the necessity of a separate treaty with Germany, resulting in the signing and eventual ratification of the U.S.–German Peace Treaty. Hughes also favored US entrance into the Permanent Court of International Justice but was unable to convince the Senate to provide support.

===Washington Naval Treaty===
Hughes&#x27;s major initiative in office was preventing an arms race among the three great naval powers of Britain, Japan, and the United States. After Senator William Borah led passage of a resolution calling on the Harding administration to negotiate an arms reduction treaty with Japan and Britain, Hughes convinced those countries as well as Italy and France to attend a naval conference in Washington. Hughes selected an American delegation consisting of himself, former Secretary of State Elihu Root, Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and Democratic Senator Oscar Underwood. Hughes hoped that the selection of Underwood would ensure bipartisan support for any treaty arising from the conference.

Prior to the conference, Hughes had carefully considered possible treaty terms since each side would seek terms that would provide its respective navy with subtle advantages. He decided to propose an arms reduction formula based on the immediate halting of all naval construction, with future construction limits based on the ship tonnage of each country. The formula would be based on the ship tonnage ratio of 1920, which stood at roughly 5:5:3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, respectively. Knowing that US and foreign naval leaders would resist his proposal, he anxiously guarded it from the press, but he won the support of Root, Lodge, and Underwood.

The Washington Naval Conference opened in November 1921, attended by five national delegations, and in the gallery by hundreds of reporters and dignitaries such as Chief Justice Taft and William Jennings Bryan. On the first day of the conference, Hughes unveiled his proposal to limit naval armaments. Hughes&#x27;s ambitious proposal to scrap all US capital ships under construction stunned the delegates, as did his proposals for the Japanese and British Navies. The British delegation, led by Arthur Balfour, supported the proposal, but the Japanese delegation, under the leadership of Katō Tomosaburō, asked for several modifications. Katō asked for the ratio to be adjusted to 10:10:7 and refused to destroy the &quot;Mutsu&quot;, a dreadnought that many Japanese saw as a symbol of national pride. Katō eventually relented on the naval ratios, but Hughes acquiesced to the retention of the &quot;Mutsu&quot;, leading to protests from British leaders. Hughes clinched an agreement after convincing Balfour to agree to limit the size of the Admiral-class battlecruisers despite objections from the British Navy. Hughes also won agreement on the Four-Power Treaty, which called for a peaceful resolution of territorial claims in the Pacific Ocean, as well as the Nine-Power Treaty, which guaranteed the territorial integrity of China. News of the success of the conference was warmly received around the world. Franklin D. Roosevelt later wrote that the conference &quot;brought to the world the first important voluntary agreement for limitation and reduction of armament.&quot;

===Other issues===

In the aftermath of World War I, the German economy struggled from the strain of postwar rebuilding and war reparations owed to the Entente, and the Entente powers in turn owed large war debts to the United States. Though many economists favored cancellation of all European war debts, French leaders were unwilling to cancel the reparations, and Congress refused to consider forgiving the war debts. Hughes helped organize the creation of an international committee of economists to study the possibility of lowering Germany&#x27;s reparations, and Hughes selected Charles G. Dawes to lead that committee. The resulting Dawes Plan, which provided for annual payments by Germany, was accepted at a 1924 conference held in London.

Hughes favored a closer relationship with the United Kingdom, and sought to coordinate US foreign policy with Great Britain concerning matters in Europe and Asia. Hughes sought better relations with the countries of Latin America, and he favored removing US troops when he believed that doing so was practicable. He formulated plans for the withdrawal of US soldiers from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua but decided that instability in Haiti required the continued presence of US soldiers. He also settled a border dispute between Panama and Costa Rica by threatening to send soldiers into Panama.

Hughes was the keynote speaker at the 1919 National Conference on Lynching.

==Return to private practice==
Hughes stayed on as Secretary of State in the Coolidge administration after the death of Harding in 1923, but he left office in early 1925. He once again returned to his law firm, becoming one of the highest-earning lawyers in the country. He also served as a special master in a case concerning Chicago&#x27;s sewage system, was elected president of the American Bar Association, and co-founded the National Conference on Christians and Jews.

State party leaders asked him to run against Al Smith in New York&#x27;s 1926 gubernatorial election, and some national party leaders suggested that he run for president in 1928, but Hughes declined to seek public office. After the 1928 Republican National Convention nominated Herbert Hoover, Hughes gave Hoover his full support and campaigned for him across the United States. Hoover won the election in a landslide and asked Hughes to serve as his Secretary of State, but Hughes declined the offer to keep his commitment to serve as a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice.

==Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice==
Hughes served on the Permanent Court of International Justice from 1928 until 1930.

==Chief Justice==
===Rejoining the Supreme Court===

On February 3, 1930, President Hoover nominated Hughes to succeed Chief Justice Taft, who was gravely ill. Though many had expected Hoover to elevate his close friend, Associate Justice Harlan Stone, Hughes was the top choice of Taft and Attorney General William D. Mitchell. Though Hughes had compiled a progressive record during his tenure as an Associate Justice, by 1930 Taft believed that Hughes would be a consistent conservative on the court. The nomination faced resistance from progressive Republicans such as senators George W. Norris and William E. Borah, who were concerned that Hughes would be overly friendly to big business after working as a corporate lawyer. Many of those progressives, as well some Southern states&#x27; rights advocates, were outraged by the Taft Court&#x27;s tendency to strike down state and federal legislation on the basis of the doctrine of substantive due process and feared that a Hughes Court would emulate the Taft Court. Adherents of the substantive due process doctrine held that economic regulations such as restrictions on child labor and minimum wages violated freedom of contract, which, they argued, could not be abridged by federal and state laws because of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Senate Judiciary Committee held no hearings, and voted to favorably report on Hughes&#x27;s nomination by a 10–2 vote on February 10, 1930. On February 13, 1930, the Senate voted 31–49 against sending his nomination back to committee. After a brief but bitter confirmation battle, Hughes was confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1930, in a 52–26 vote, and he took his judicial oath of office on February 24, 1930. Hughes&#x27;s son, Charles Jr., was subsequently forced to resign as Solicitor General after his father took office as Chief Justice. Hughes quickly emerged as a leader of the Court, earning the admiration of his fellow justices for his intelligence, energy, and strong understanding of the law. Shortly after Hughes was confirmed, Hoover nominated federal judge John J. Parker to succeed deceased Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford. The Senate rejected Parker, whose earlier rulings had alienated labor unions and the NAACP, but confirmed Hoover&#x27;s second nominee, Owen Roberts. In early 1932, the other justices asked Hughes to request the resignation of Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose health had declined as he entered his nineties. Hughes privately asked his old friend to retire, and Holmes immediately sent a letter of resignation to President Hoover. To replace Holmes, Hoover nominated Benjamin N. Cardozo, who quickly won confirmation.

The early Hughes Court was divided between the conservative &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; and the liberal &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. The primary difference between these two blocs was that the Four Horsemen embraced the substantive due process doctrine, but the liberals, including Louis Brandeis, advocated for judicial restraint, or deference to legislative bodies. Hughes and Roberts were the swing justices between the two blocs for much of the 1930s.In one of the first major cases of his tenure, Hughes joined with Roberts and the Three Musketeers to strike down a piece of state legislation in the 1931 landmark case of &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot;. In his majority opinion, Hughes held that the First Amendment barred states from violating freedom of the press. Hughes also wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot;, which represented the first time the Supreme Court struck down a state law on the basis of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights. In another early case, &quot;O&#x27;Gorman &amp; Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.&quot;, Hughes and Roberts joined with the liberal bloc in upholding a state regulation that limited commissions for the sale of fire insurance.

===Roosevelt takes office===
During Hoover&#x27;s presidency, the country plunged into the Great Depression. As the country faced an ongoing economic calamity, Franklin D. Roosevelt decisively defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election. Responding to the Great Depression, Roosevelt passed a bevy of domestic legislation as part of his New Deal domestic program, and the response to the New Deal became one of the key issues facing the Hughes Court. In the Gold Clause Cases, a series of cases that presented some of the first major tests of New Deal laws, the Hughes Court upheld the voiding of the &quot;gold clauses&quot; in private and public contracts that was favored by the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt, who had expected the Supreme Court to rule adversely to his administration&#x27;s position, was elated by the outcome, writing that &quot;as a lawyer it seems to me that the Supreme Court has at last definitely put human values ahead of the &#x27;pound of flesh&#x27; called for by a contract.&quot; The Hughes Court also continued to adjudicate major cases concerning the states. In the 1934 case of &quot;Home Building &amp; Loan Ass&#x27;n v. Blaisdell&quot;, Hughes and Roberts joined the Three Musketeers in upholding a Minnesota law that established a moratorium on mortgage payments. Hughes&#x27;s majority opinion in that case stated that &quot;while an emergency does not create power, an emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.&quot;Beginning with the 1935 case of &quot;Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.&quot;, Roberts started siding with the Four Horsemen, creating a majority bloc that struck down New Deal laws. The court held that Congress had, in passing an act that provided a mandatory retirement and pension system for railroad industry workers, violated due process and exceeded the regulatory powers granted to it by the Commerce Clause. Hughes strongly criticized Roberts&#x27;s majority opinion in his dissent, writing that &quot;the power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it be perfect. The power implies a broad discretion.&quot; Nonetheless, in May 1935, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down three New Deal laws. Writing the majority opinion in &quot;A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot;, Hughes held that Roosevelt&#x27;s National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 was doubly unconstitutional, falling afoul of both the Commerce Clause and the nondelegation doctrine.

In the 1936 case of &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, Hughes surprised many observers by joining with Roberts and the Four Horsemen in striking down the Agricultural Adjustment Act. In doing so, the court dismantled the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the major New Deal agricultural program. In another 1936 case, &quot;Carter v. Carter Coal Co.&quot;, the Supreme Court struck down the Guffey Coal Act, which regulated the bituminous coal industry. Hughes wrote a concurring opinion in &quot;Carter&quot; in which he agreed with the majority&#x27;s holding that Congress could not use its Commerce Clause powers to &quot;regulate activities and relations within the states which affect interstate commerce only indirectly.&quot; In the final case of the 1936 term, &quot;Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo&quot;, Roberts joined with the Four Horsemen in striking down New York&#x27;s minimum wage law. President Roosevelt had held up the New York minimum wage law as a model for other states to follow, and many Republicans as well as Democrats attacked the decision for interfering with the states. In December 1936, the court handed down its near-unanimous opinion in &quot;United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.&quot;, upholding a law that granted the president the power to place an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay. Justice Sutherland&#x27;s majority opinion, which Hughes joined, explained that the Constitution had granted the president broad powers to conduct foreign policy.

===Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937===
Roosevelt won re-election in a landslide in the 1936 presidential election, and congressional Democrats grew their majorities in both houses of Congress. As the Supreme Court had already struck down both the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the president feared that the court would next strike down other key New Deal laws, including the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (also known as the Wagner Act) and the Social Security Act. In early 1937, Roosevelt proposed to increase the number of Supreme Court seats through the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (also known as the &quot;court-packing plan&quot;). Roosevelt argued that the bill was necessary because Supreme Court justices were unable to meet their case load. With large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, Roosevelt&#x27;s bill had a strong chance of passage in early 1937. However, the bill was poorly received by the public, as many saw the bill as power grab or as an attack on a sacrosanct institution. Hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort, rushing important New Deal legislation through the Supreme Court in an effort to quickly uphold the constitutionality of the laws. He also sent a letter to Senator Burton K. Wheeler, asserting that the Supreme Court was fully capable of handling its case load. Hughes&#x27;s letter had a powerful impact in discrediting Roosevelt&#x27;s argument about the practical need for more Supreme Court justices.

While the debate over the court-packing plan continued, the Supreme Court upheld, in a 5–4 vote, the state of Washington&#x27;s minimum wage law in the case of &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;. Joined by the Three Musketeers and Roberts, Hughes wrote the majority opinion, which overturned the 1923 case of &quot;Adkins v. Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot;. In his majority opinion, Hughes wrote that the &quot;Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract&quot;, and further held that the Washington legislature &quot;was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the &#x27;sweating system,&#x27; the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living.&quot; Because Roberts had previously sided with the four conservative justices in &quot;Tipaldo&quot;, a similar case, it was widely perceived that Roberts agreed to uphold the constitutionality of minimum wage as a result of the pressure that was put on the Supreme Court by the court-packing plan (a theory referred to as &quot;the switch in time that saved nine&quot;). However, Hughes and Roberts both later indicated that Roberts had committed to changing his judicial stance on state minimum wage law months before Roosevelt announced his court-packing plan. Roberts had voted to grant &quot;certiorari&quot; to hear the &quot;Parrish&quot; case even before the 1936 presidential election, and oral arguments for the case had taken place in late 1936. In an initial conference vote held on December 19, 1936, Roberts had voted to uphold the law. Scholars continue to debate why Roberts essentially switched his vote with regards to state minimum wage laws, but Hughes may have played an important role in influencing Roberts to uphold the law.

Weeks after the court handed down its decision in &quot;Parrish&quot;, Hughes wrote for the majority again in &quot;NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.&quot; Joined by Roberts and the Three Musketeers, Hughes upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act case marked a turning point for the Supreme Court, as the court began a pattern of upholding New Deal laws. Later in 1937, the court upheld both the old age benefits and the taxation system established by the Social Security Act. Meanwhile, conservative Associate Justice Willis Van Devanter announced his retirement, undercutting Roosevelt&#x27;s arguments for the necessity of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. By the end of the year, the court-packing plan had died in the Senate, and Roosevelt had been dealt a serious political wound that emboldened the conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans. However, throughout 1937, Hughes had presided over a massive shift in jurisprudence that marked the end of the Lochner era, a period during which the Supreme Court had frequently struck down state and federal economic regulations. Hugo Black, Roosevelt&#x27;s nominee to succeed Van Devanter, was confirmed by the Senate in August 1937. He was joined by Stanley Forman Reed, who succeeded Sutherland, the following year, leaving pro-New Deal liberals with a majority on the Supreme Court.

===Later tenure===

After 1937, the Hughes Court continued to uphold economic regulations, with McReynolds and Butler often being the lone dissenters. The liberal bloc was strengthened even further in 1940, when Butler was succeeded by another Roosevelt appointee, Frank Murphy. In the case of &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot;, Justice Stone&#x27;s majority opinion articulated a broad theory of deference to economic regulations. &quot;Carolene Products&quot; established that the Supreme Court would conduct a &quot;rational basis review&quot; of economic regulations, meaning that the Court would only strike down a regulation if legislators lacked a &quot;rational basis&quot; for passing the regulation. The Supreme Court showed that it would defer to state legislators in the cases of &quot;Madden v. Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Olsen v. Nebraska&quot;. Hughes joined the majority in another case, &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot;, which upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

The Hughes Court also faced several civil rights cases. Hughes wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot;, which required the state of Missouri to either integrate its law school or establish a separate law school for African-Americans. He joined and helped arrange unanimous support for Black&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Chambers v. Florida&quot;, which overturned the conviction of a defendant who had been coerced into confessing a crime. In the 1940 case of &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, Hughes joined the majority decision, which held that public schools could require students to salute the American flag despite the students&#x27; religious objections to these practices.

Hughes began to consider retiring in 1940, partly due to the declining health of his wife. In June 1941, he informed Roosevelt of his impending retirement. Hughes suggested that Roosevelt elevate Stone to the position of Chief Justice, a suggestion that Roosevelt accepted. Hughes retired in 1941, and Stone was confirmed as the new Chief Justice, beginning the Stone Court.

==Retirement and death==

During his retirement, Hughes generally refrained from re-entering public life or giving advice on public policy, but he agreed to review the United Nations Charter for Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and recommended that President Harry S. Truman appoint Fred M. Vinson as Chief Justice after the death of Stone. He lived in New York City with his wife, Antoinette, until she died in December 1945. On August 27, 1948, at the age of 86, Hughes died in what is now the Tiffany Cottage of the Wianno Club in Osterville, Massachusetts. When he died, Hughes was the last living Justice to have served on the White Court.

He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==

In the evaluation of historian Dexter Perkins, in domestic politics:
:Hughes was a happy mixture of the liberal and the conservative. He was wise enough to know that you cannot preserve a social order unless you eradicate its abuses, and so he was never a stand-patter. On the other side he could see that change carried perils as well as promises. Sometimes he stood out against these perils. He was not always wise, it is true. We do not have to agree with him in everything. But he stands a noble and constructive figure in American life.

In the consensus view of scholars, Hughes as a diplomat was:
: an outstanding Secretary of State. He possessed a clear vision of America&#x27;s position in the new international system. The United States would be a world leader, not only in terms of its ability to provide material progress, but also by its advocacy of diplomacy and arbitration over military force. Hughes was fully committed to the supremacy of negotiation and the maintenance of American foreign policy. This quality was combined with an ability to maintain a clear sense of the larger goals of American diplomacy ... He was able to maintain control over US foreign policy and take the country into a new role as a world power.

Hughes has been honored in a variety of ways, including in the names of several schools, rooms, and events. Other things named for Hughes include the Hughes Range in Antarctica. On April 11, 1962, the 100th anniversary of Hughes&#x27;s birth, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp in his honor. The Charles Evans Hughes House, now the Burmese ambassador&#x27;s residence, in Washington, D.C., was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.

Judge Learned Hand once observed that Hughes was the greatest lawyer he had ever known, &quot;except that his son (Charles Evans Hughes Jr.) was even greater.&quot;

<doc id="7527" wikidata="Q207393" url="?curid=7527" title="Concept album">
<text>A concept album is an album whose tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually. This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical. Sometimes the term is applied to albums considered to be of &quot;uniform excellence&quot; rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif. There is no consensus among music critics as to the specific criteria for what a &quot;concept album&quot; is.

The format originates with folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot; (1940) and was subsequently popularized by traditional pop singer Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1940s–50s string of albums, although the term is more often associated with rock music. In the 1960s several well-regarded concept albums were released by various rock bands, which eventually led to the birth of progressive rock and rock opera.

==Definitions==
There is no clear definition of a &quot;concept album&quot;. Fiona Sturges of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that the concept album &quot;was originally defined as a long-player where the songs were based on one dramatic idea – but the term is subjective.&quot; A precursor to this type of album can be found in the 19th-century song cycle, which ran into similar difficulties in classification. The extremely broad definitions of a &quot;concept album&quot; could potentially encompass all soundtracks, compilations, cast recordings, greatest hits albums, tribute albums, Christmas albums, and live albums.

The most common definitions refer to an expanded approach to a rock album (as a story, play, or opus), or a project that either revolves around a specific theme or a collection of related materials. AllMusic writes, &quot;A concept album could be a collection of songs by an individual songwriter or a particular theme – these are the concept LPs that reigned in the &#x27;50s ... the phrase &#x27;concept album&#x27; is inextricably tied to the late 1960s, when rock &amp; rollers began stretching the limits of their art form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic/Concept albums&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jim Cullen describes it as &quot;a collection of discrete but thematically unified songs whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts ... sometimes [erroneously] assumed to be a product of the rock era.&quot; Author Roy Shuker defines concept albums and rock operas as albums that are &quot;unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical. ... In this form, the album changed from a collection of heterogeneous songs into a narrative work with a single theme, in which individual songs segue into one another.&quot;

Speaking of concepts in albums during the 1970s, Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), because &quot;overall impression&quot; of an album matters, &quot;concept intensifies the impact&quot; of certain albums &quot;in more or less the way &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; intended&quot;, as well as &quot;a species of concept that pushes a rhythmically unrelenting album like &quot;The Wild Magnolias&quot; or a vocally irresistible one like Shirley Brown&#x27;s &quot;Woman to Woman&quot;, to a deeper level of significance.&quot;

==History==
===1940s–50s: Origins===
In the 2016 BBC documentary &quot;When Pop Went Epic: The Crazy World of the Concept Album&quot;, it is suggested that the first concept album is Woody Guthrie&#x27;s 1940 album &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; regards it as &quot;perhaps&quot; one of the first concept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s. In the late 1940s, the LP record was introduced, with space age pop composers producing concept albums soon after. Themes included exploring wild life and dealing with emotions, with some albums meant to be played while dining or relaxing. This was accompanied in the mid-1950s with the invention of the gatefold, which allowed room for liner notes to explain the concept.

Singer Frank Sinatra recorded several concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot; (1955) and &quot;Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely&quot; (1958). Sinatra is occasionally credited as the inventor of the concept album, beginning with &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot; (1946), which led to similar work by Bing Crosby. According to biographer Will Friedwald, Sinatra &quot;sequenced the songs so that the lyrics created a flow from track to track, affording an impression of a narrative, as in musical comedy or opera. ... [He was the] first pop singer to bring a consciously artistic attitude to recording.&quot;

Singer/pianist Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole (who, along with Sinatra, often collaborated with arranger Nelson Riddle during this era) was also an early pioneer of concept albums, as with his &quot;Wild Is Love&quot; (1960), a suite of original songs about a man&#x27;s search for love.

===1960s: Rock and country music===
In the early 1960s, concept albums became highly featured in American country music, but the fact went largely unacknowledged by rock/pop fans and critics, who would only begin noting &quot;concept albums&quot; as a phenomenon later in the decade, when albums became closely aligned with countercultural ideology, resulting in a recognised &quot;album era&quot; and the introduction of the rock concept album. The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967), and the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) are variously cited as &quot;the first concept album&quot;, usually for their &quot;uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif&quot;.

Other records have been claimed as &quot;early&quot; or &quot;first&quot; concept albums. The Beach Boys&#x27; first six albums, released over 1962–64, featured collections of songs unified respectively by a central concept, such as cars, surfing, and teenage lifestyles. Writing in &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, Chris Smith commented: &quot;Though albums such as Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1955 &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot; and Marty Robbins&#x27; 1959 &quot;Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs&quot; had already introduced concept albums, [the Beach Boys&#x27; 1963 album] &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers.&quot; Music historian Larry Starr, who identifies the Beach Boys&#x27; 1964 releases &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; and &quot;All Summer Long&quot; as heralding the album era, cites &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as the first rock concept album on the basis that it had been &quot;conceived as an integrated whole, with interrelated songs arranged in a deliberate sequence.&quot;

&quot;The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time&quot; (2015) states that the Ventures &quot;pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born&quot;. Writing in his &quot;Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture&quot;, Marcel Danesi identifies the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965) and the Who&#x27;s &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (1967) as other examples of early concept albums. Brian Boyd of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; names the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1966) as the first concept album: &quot;Written entirely by Ray Davies, the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It&#x27;s not one of the band&#x27;s finest works, but it did have an impact.&quot;

&quot;Popular consensus&quot; for the first rock concept album, according to AllMusic, favours &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. According to music critic Tim Riley, &quot;Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s &quot;Freak Out!&quot; [1966] has claims as the first &#x27;concept album&#x27;, but &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears.&quot; Musicologist Allan Moore says that &quot;Even though previous albums had set a unified mood (notably Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot;), it was on the basis of the influence of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that the penchant for the concept album was born.&quot; Adding to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;″s claim, the artwork reinforced its central theme by depicting the four Beatles in uniform as members of the Sgt. Pepper band, while the record omitted the gaps that usually separated album tracks. Music critic and journalist Neil Slaven stated that Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, released the same day as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, was &quot;very much a concept album, but The Beatles effortlessly stole his thunder&quot;, and subsequently &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was hailed as &quot;perhaps the first &#x27;concept album&#x27; even though the songs were unrelated.&quot;

===1960s–70s: Rock operas, progressive rock, soul, and disco===
Author Bill Martin relates the assumed concept albums of the 1960s to progressive rock:

&quot;Popmatters&quot;″ Sarah Zupko notes that while the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; is &quot;popularly thought of as the first rock opera, an extra-long concept album with characters, a consistent storyline, and a slight bit of pomposity&quot;, it is preceded by the shorter concept albums &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; (Small Faces, 1968) and &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; (The Pretty Things, 1968). Author Jim Cullen states: &quot;The concept album reached its apogee in the 1970s in ambitious records like Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976).&quot; In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; at number one among the 50 greatest progressive rock albums of all time, also noting the LP&#x27;s stature as the second-best-selling album of all time. Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979), a semi-autobiographical story modeled after the band&#x27;s Roger Waters and former member Syd Barrett, is one of the most famous concept albums by any artist. In addition to &quot;The Wall&quot;, Danesi highlights Genesis&#x27; &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) and Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; (1979) as other culturally significant concept albums.

According to author Edward Macan, concept albums as a recurrent theme in progressive rock was directly inspired by the counterculture associated with &quot;the proto-progressive bands of the 1960s&quot;, observing: &quot;the consistent use of lengthy forms such as the programmatic song cycle of the concept album and the multimovement suite underscores the hippies&#x27; new, drug-induced conception of time.&quot; 

Progressive soul musicians inspired by this approach conceived concept albums during this era reflecting themes and concerns of the African-American experience, including Marvin Gaye (1971&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;), George Clinton (the 1975 Parliament album &quot;Mothership Connection&quot;), and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Innervisions&quot;and 1976 &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;.

By the mid-1970s, concept albums extended to disco music artists. Examples include Phylicia Rashad&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Josephine Superstar&quot;, which details the life of film star and activist Josephine Baker; Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; (1975) featuring space disco elements such as sci-fi, UFOs, galactic exploration, and spaceflight;&quot;&quot; and The Undisputed Truth&#x27;s &quot;Method to the Madness&quot; (1976) which is framed by the group&#x27;s abduction by aliens and performance for &quot;the Space Gods&quot;.

===1980s–present: Decline and return to popularity===

With the emergence of MTV as a music video network which valued singles over albums, concept albums became less dominant in the 1980s. Some artists, however, still released concept albums and experienced success in the 1990s and 2000s. &quot;NME&quot;″s Emily Barker cites Green Day&#x27;s &quot;American Idiot&quot; (2004) as one of the &quot;more notable&quot; examples, having brought the concept album back to high-charting positions. My Chemical Romance’s &quot;The Black Parade&quot; (2006) is another example of a modern concept album. Dorian Lynskey, writing for &quot;GQ&quot;, noted a resurgence of concept albums in the 2010s due to streaming: &quot;This is happening not in spite of the rise of streaming and playlists, but because of it. Threatened with redundancy in the digital era, albums have fought back by becoming more album-like.&quot; Cucchiara argues that concept albums should also describe &quot;this new generation of concept albums, for one key reason. This is because the unison between the songs on a particular album has now been expanded into a broader field of visual and artistic design and marketing strategies that play into the themes and stories that form the album.&quot;

Towards the end of the 80s, however, as heavy metal suited a fairly niche crowd, a few heavy metal artists began producing concept albums, particularly among the more progressive groups. King Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Abigail&quot; and Savatage&#x27;s &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, both released in 1987, stand some of the earliest examples of concept albums produced by a heavy metal artist. A year later, Iron Maiden&#x27;s, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, released in 1988, would become one of the most notable examples of a heavy metal concept album at the time. Around this time, progressive metal began taking form with artists such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Savatage. Shortly later in 1988, Queensrÿche would release &quot;&quot;, which would be considered one of the first progressive metal albums, and was also a concept album. Thus it could be argued that from the genre&#x27;s inception, progressive metal has been a hotspot for concept albums, like its rock counterpart. Other notable progressive metal concept albums are Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot;, Opeth&#x27;s &quot;Still Life&quot;, and Orphaned Land&#x27;s &quot;Mabool&quot;.

In the 21st century, the field of classical music has adopted the idea of the concept album, citing such historical examples as Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot; and Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Liederkreis&quot; as prototypes for contemporary composers and musicians. Classical composers and performers increasingly adopt production and marketing strategies that unify otherwise disparate works into concept albums or concerts. Since 2019, the classical music magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot; has included a special category for &quot;concept album&quot; in its annual recordings of the year awards, to celebrate &quot;albums where a creative mind has curated something visionary, a programme whose whole speaks more powerfully than its parts. A thought-through journey, which compels to be heard in one sitting.&quot;

In a year-ending essay on the album in 2019, Ann Powers wrote for &quot;Slate&quot; that the year found the medium in a state of flux. In her observation, many recording artists revitalized the concept album around autobiographical narratives and personal themes, such as intimacy, intersectionality, African-American life, boundaries among women, and grief associated with death. She cited such albums as Brittany Howard&#x27;s &quot;Jaime&quot;, Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot;, Jamila Woods&#x27; &quot;Legacy! Legacy!&quot;, Rapsody&#x27;s &quot;Eve&quot;, Jenny Lewis&#x27; &quot;On the Line&quot;, Julia Jacklin&#x27;s &quot;Crushing&quot;, Joe Henry&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel According to Water&quot;, and Nick Cave&#x27;s &quot;Ghosteen&quot;. &quot;&quot;, a series of concept albums retelling &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, arose to massive popularity, with its first release in January 2023 surpassing three million streams within its first week of release and the musical remaining popular as subsequent &quot;saga&quot; albums were released.

<text>The cro-hook is a special double-ended crochet hook used to make double-sided crochet. 
It employs the use of a long double-ended hook, which permits the maker to work stitches on or off from either end. Because the hook has two ends, two alternating colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged, working loops over the hook. Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit. Cro-hook is a variation of Tunisian crochet and also shows similarities with the Afghan stitch used to make Afghan scarves, but the fabric is typically softer with greater elasticity.

<doc id="7531" wikidata="Q191823" url="?curid=7531" title="Clavichord">
<text>The clavichord is a stringed rectangular keyboard instrument that was used largely in the Late Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras.
Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;clavis&quot;, meaning &quot;key&quot; (associated with more common &quot;clavus&quot;, meaning &quot;nail, rod, etc.&quot;) and &quot;chorda&quot; (from Greek χορδή) meaning &quot;string, especially of a musical instrument&quot;. An analogous name is used in other European languages (It. &quot;clavicordio&quot;, &quot;clavicordo&quot;; Fr. &quot;clavicorde&quot;; Germ. &quot;Klavichord&quot;; Lat. &quot;clavicordium&quot;; Port. &quot;clavicórdio&quot;; Sp. &quot;clavicordio&quot;). Many languages also have another name derived from Latin &quot;manus&quot;, meaning &quot;hand&quot; (It. &quot;manicordo&quot;; Fr. &quot;manicorde&quot;, &quot;manicordion&quot;; Sp. &quot;manicordio&quot;, &quot;manucordio&quot;). Other names refer to the monochord-like nature of a fully fretted clavichord (It. &quot;monacordo&quot; or &quot;monocordo&quot;; Sp. &quot;monacordio&quot;). Italian also used &quot;sordino&quot;, a reference to its quiet sound (sordino usually designates a mute).

==History and use==
The clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century. In 1404, the German poem &quot;&quot; mentions the terms &quot;clavicimbalum&quot; (a term used mainly for the harpsichord) and &quot;clavichordium&quot;, designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies.

One of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:
Item. The same day, Hugh Denys for money by him delivered to a stranger that gave the queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns form his reward iiii libres.

The clavichord was very popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, but mainly flourished in German-speaking lands, Scandinavia, and the Iberian Peninsula in the latter part of this period. It had fallen out of use by 1850. In the late 1890s, Arnold Dolmetsch revived clavichord construction and Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, among others, helped to popularize the instrument. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small (four octaves, four feet long), the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range. 

It was a preferred instrument in the 18th century due to its unique expressive features, size, elegance, and affordability.
Due to its lower cost compared to other instruments, the clavichord was accessible, making it the first choice for individuals who wanted to learn the keyboard. Composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791), used to bring the clavichord with them on their travels to practice.

During the Mozart family&#x27;s visit to Augsburg, they had the chance to visit the outstanding German keyboard instruments maker, Johann Andreas Stein (1728–1792), and purchased a clavichord from him. In a letter to his friend, Leopold Mozart (1719–1787) described it as 
&quot;A pretty little keyboard instrument, which does us good service for practicing on during our travels.&quot;

Until electronic amplification in the twentieth century, it was impossible to use the quiet clavichord in anything but a small room. However, during the clavichord&#x27;s heyday, evenings of music-making in the home formed the largest part of people&#x27;s musical experiences. In the home the clavichord was the ideal instrument for solo keyboard music and instrumental accompaniment.Organists also were known to practice in their homes on pedal clavichords.

Today clavichords are played primarily by Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical music enthusiasts. They attract many interested buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument have included Christopher Hogwood and Thurston Dart.

===Modern music===
The clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, in the form of the Clavinet, which is a solid body electric clavichord with magnetic pickups that plug into an amp. Stevie Wonder uses a Clavinet in many of his songs, such as &quot;Superstition&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. A Clavinet played through an instrument amplifier with guitar effect pedals is often associated with funky, disco-infused 1970s rock.

Guy Sigsworth has played clavichord in a modern setting with Björk, notably on the studio recording of &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;. Björk also made extensive use of and even played the instrument herself on the song &quot;My Juvenile&quot; of her 2007 album &quot;Volta&quot;.

Tori Amos uses the instrument on &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot; from the album &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; and on the song &quot;Smokey Joe&quot; from her 2007 album &quot;American Doll Posse&quot;. Amos also featured her use of the Clavinet on her 2004 recording &quot;Not David Bowie&quot;, released as part of her 2006 box set, &quot;A Piano: The Collection&quot;.

In 1976 Oscar Peterson played (with Joe Pass on acoustic guitar) songs from &quot;Porgy And Bess&quot; on the clavichord. Keith Jarrett also recorded an album titled &quot;Book of Ways&quot; (1986) in which he plays a series of clavichord improvisations. The Beatles&#x27; &quot;For No One&quot; (1966) features Paul McCartney playing the clavichord. Rick Wakeman plays the Clavinet in the track &quot;The Battle&quot; from the album &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;.

==Structure and action==

In the clavichord, strings run transversely from the hitchpin rail at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the &quot;hammering&quot; technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as &quot;Bebung&quot;). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.

The action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player&#x27;s hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, and volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord.

==Fretting==
Since the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called &quot;fretting&quot;. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed monochord—an instrument with only one string—though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of tuning (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in chamber music), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: temperament could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a legato line.

Some clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by Johann Speth in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as &quot;unfretted&quot; whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called &quot;fretted&quot;. Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for &quot;bad&quot; notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and &quot;many&quot; more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords.

==Pedal clavichord==

While clavichords were typically single manual instruments, they could be stacked, one clavichord on top of another, to provide multiple keyboards. With the addition of a pedal clavichord, which included a pedal keyboard for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice organ repertoire. Most often, the addition of a pedal keyboard only involved connecting the keys of the pedalboard to the lower notes on the manual clavichord using string so the lower notes on the manual instrument could be operated by the feet. In the era of pipe organs, which used man-powered bellows that required several people to operate, and of churches only heated during church services if at all, organists used pedal harpsichords and pedal clavichords as practice instruments (see also: pedal piano). There is speculation that some works written for organ may have been intended for pedal clavichord. An interesting case is made by that Bach&#x27;s &quot;Eight Little Preludes and Fugues&quot;, now thought spurious, may actually be authentic. The keyboard writing seems unsuited to organ, but Speerstra argues that they are idiomatic on the pedal clavichord. As Speerstra and also note, the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach&#x27;s six trio sonatas for organ (BWV 525–530) rarely go below the tenor C, so they could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century.

==Repertoire==
Much of the musical repertoire written for harpsichord and organ from the period circa 1400–1800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it does not have enough (unamplified) volume to participate in chamber music, with the possible exception of providing accompaniment to a soft baroque flute, recorder, or single singer. J. S. Bach&#x27;s son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was a great proponent of the instrument, and most of his German contemporaries regarded it as a central keyboard instrument, for performing, teaching, composing and practicing. The fretting of a clavichord provides new problems for some repertoire, but scholarship suggests that these problems are not insurmountable in Bach&#x27;s Well-Tempered Clavier.

C. P. E. Bach, one of the leading representatives of the &#x27;Empfindsamer stil&#x27; or &#x27;Sensitive Style,&#x27; emphasized emotional depth and expressiveness in his compositions. The clavichord was very successful in conveying these characteristics. With its unique sound, touch sensitivity, and ability to convey the most delicate nuances, the clavichord became C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s most preferred instrument. C. P. E. Bach also used the fortepiano in his compositions, but he was much more interested in the technical features provided by the clavichord. He mentioned this in his book (Versuch über die wahre, Art das Clavier zu spielen, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Berlin, 1759.):
&quot;Of the many keyboard instruments, many of which are little known because of defects, or because they have not yet been introduced everywhere, there are two which have been most widely acclaimed, the harpsichord and the clavichord. The former is used mainly in louder music, the latter alone. The more recent pianofortes, when they are durable and well built, have many advantages, although their touch must be carefully worked out, a task which is not without difficulties. They sound well by themselves and in small ensembles. Yet, I hold that a good clavichord, except for its weaker tone, shares equally in the attractiveness of the pianoforte and in addition features the vibrato (Bebung) and portato (Tragen der Töne) which I produce by means of added pressure after each stroke. It is at the clavichord that a keyboard player may be most exactly evaluated.&quot;

Among recent clavichord recordings, those by Christopher Hogwood (&quot;The Secret Bach&quot;, &quot;The Secret Handel&quot;, and &quot;The Secret Mozart&quot;), break new ground. In his liner notes, Hogwood pointed out that these composers would typically have played the clavichord in the privacy of their homes. In England, the composer Herbert Howells (1892–1983) wrote two significant collections of pieces for clavichord (&quot;Lambert&#x27;s Clavichord&quot; and &quot;Howells&#x27; Clavichord&quot;), and Stephen Dodgson (1924–2013) wrote two clavichord suites.

In a note written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s wife, Constanze Mozart (1761–1842), found inside Mozart&#x27;s clavichord, it is mentioned that Mozart composed his works, including The Magic Flute, La Clemenza di Tito, The Requiem, and a Masonic Cantata, on this clavichord. 

Haydn composed the greater part of &quot;The Creation&quot;, one of his masterpieces, on the clavichord. He used the clavichord to accompany the voice.

<doc id="7534" wikidata="Q172881" url="?curid=7534" title="Centripetal force">
<text>A centripetal force (from Latin &quot;centrum&quot;, &quot;center&quot; and &quot;petere&quot;, &quot;to seek&quot;) is a force that makes a body follow a curved path. The direction of the centripetal force is always orthogonal to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path. Isaac Newton described it as &quot;a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre&quot;. In Newtonian mechanics, gravity provides the centripetal force causing astronomical orbits.

One common example involving centripetal force is the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. The centripetal force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path. The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.

== Formula ==
From the kinematics of curved motion it is known that an object moving at tangential speed &quot;v&quot; along a path with radius of curvature &quot;r&quot; accelerates toward the center of curvature at a rate 
formula_1
Here, formula_2 is the centripetal acceleration and formula_3 is the difference between the velocity vectors at formula_4 and formula_5.

By Newton&#x27;s second law, the cause of acceleration is a net force acting on the object, which is proportional to its mass &quot;m&quot; and its acceleration. The force, usually referred to as a &quot;centripetal force&quot;, has a magnitude
formula_6
and is, like centripetal acceleration, directed toward the center of curvature of the object&#x27;s trajectory.

=== Derivation ===
The centripetal acceleration can be inferred from the diagram of the velocity vectors at two instances. In the case of uniform circular motion the velocities have constant magnitude. Because each one is perpendicular to its respective position vector, simple vector subtraction implies two similar isosceles triangles with congruent angles – one comprising a base of formula_3 and a leg length of formula_8, and the other a base of formula_9 (position vector difference) and a leg length of formula_10:
formula_11
formula_12
Therefore, formula_13 can be substituted with formula_14:
formula_15
The direction of the force is toward the center of the circle in which the object is moving, or the osculating circle (the circle that best fits the local path of the object, if the path is not circular).
The speed in the formula is squared, so twice the speed needs four times the force, at a given radius.

This force is also sometimes written in terms of the angular velocity &quot;ω&quot; of the object about the center of the circle, related to the tangential velocity by the formula
formula_16
so that
formula_17

Expressed using the orbital period &quot;T&quot; for one revolution of the circle,
formula_18
the equation becomes
formula_19

In particle accelerators, velocity can be very high (close to the speed of light in vacuum) so the same rest mass now exerts greater inertia (relativistic mass) thereby requiring greater force for the same centripetal acceleration, so the equation becomes:
formula_20
where
formula_21
is the Lorentz factor.

Thus the centripetal force is given by:
formula_22
which is the rate of change of relativistic momentum formula_23.

== Sources ==

In the case of an object that is swinging around on the end of a rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a &#x27;pull&#x27; force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a &#x27;push&#x27; force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a wall of death or a Rotor rider.

Newton&#x27;s idea of a centripetal force corresponds to what is nowadays referred to as a central force. When a satellite is in orbit around a planet, gravity is considered to be a centripetal force even though in the case of eccentric orbits, the gravitational force is directed towards the focus, and not towards the instantaneous center of curvature.

Another example of centripetal force arises in the helix that is traced out when a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field in the absence of other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the centripetal force that acts towards the helix axis.

== Analysis of several cases ==

Below are three examples of increasing complexity, with derivations of the formulas governing velocity and acceleration.

=== Uniform circular motion ===
Uniform circular motion refers to the case of constant rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.

==== Calculus derivation ====
In two dimensions, the position vector formula_24, which has magnitude (length) formula_10 and directed at an angle formula_26 above the x-axis, can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates using the unit vectors formula_27 and formula_28:
formula_29

The assumption of uniform circular motion requires three things:
# The object moves only on a circle.
# The radius of the circle formula_10 does not change in time.
# The object moves with constant angular velocity formula_31 around the circle. Therefore, formula_32 where formula_5 is time.

The velocity formula_34 and acceleration formula_35 of the motion are the first and second derivatives of position with respect to time:

formula_36
formula_37
formula_38

The term in parentheses is the original expression of formula_24 in Cartesian coordinates. Consequently,
formula_40
negative shows that the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle (opposite the radius), hence it is called &quot;centripetal&quot; (i.e. &quot;center-seeking&quot;). While objects naturally follow a straight path (due to inertia), this centripetal acceleration describes the circular motion path caused by a centripetal force.

==== Derivation using vectors ====
The image at right shows the vector relationships for uniform circular motion. The rotation itself is represented by the angular velocity vector Ω, which is normal to the plane of the orbit (using the right-hand rule) and has magnitude given by:
: formula_41

with &quot;θ&quot; the angular position at time &quot;t&quot;. In this subsection, d&quot;θ&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; is assumed constant, independent of time. The distance traveled dℓ of the particle in time d&quot;t&quot; along the circular path is
: formula_42

which, by properties of the vector cross product, has magnitude &quot;r&quot;d&quot;θ&quot; and is in the direction tangent to the circular path.

Consequently,
: formula_43

Differentiating with respect to time,
formula_44

Lagrange&#x27;s formula states:
formula_45

Applying Lagrange&#x27;s formula with the observation that Ω • r(&quot;t&quot;) = 0 at all times,
formula_46

In words, the acceleration is pointing directly opposite to the radial displacement r at all times, and has a magnitude:
formula_47
where vertical bars |...| denote the vector magnitude, which in the case of r(&quot;t&quot;) is simply the radius &quot;r&quot; of the path. This result agrees with the previous section, though the notation is slightly different.

When the rate of rotation is made constant in the analysis of nonuniform circular motion, that analysis agrees with this one.

A merit of the vector approach is that it is manifestly independent of any coordinate system.

==== Example: The banked turn ====

The upper panel in the image at right shows a ball in circular motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle &quot;θ&quot; from the horizontal, and the surface of the road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.

Apart from any acceleration that might occur in the direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are &quot;two&quot; forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball &quot;mg, where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface &quot;man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.

The horizontal net force on the ball is the horizontal component of the force from the road, which has magnitude . The vertical component of the force from the road must counteract the gravitational force: , which implies . Substituting into the above formula for yields a horizontal force to be:
formula_48

On the other hand, at velocity |v| on a circular path of radius &quot;r&quot;, kinematics says that the force needed to turn the ball continuously into the turn is the radially inward centripetal force Fc of magnitude:
formula_49

Consequently, the ball is in a stable path when the angle of the road is set to satisfy the condition:
formula_50
or,
formula_51

As the angle of bank &quot;θ&quot; approaches 90°, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/&quot;r&quot;. In words, this equation states that for greater speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for &quot;θ&quot;), and for sharper turns (smaller &quot;r&quot;) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle &quot;θ&quot; does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.

These ideas apply to air flight as well. See the FAA pilot&#x27;s manual.

=== Nonuniform circular motion ===


As a generalization of the uniform circular motion case, suppose the angular rate of rotation is not constant. The acceleration now has a tangential component, as shown the image at right. This case is used to demonstrate a derivation strategy based on a polar coordinate system.

Let r(&quot;t&quot;) be a vector that describes the position of a point mass as a function of time. Since we are assuming circular motion, let , where &quot;R&quot; is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of u&quot;r&quot; is described by &quot;θ&quot;, the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, uθ is perpendicular to u&quot;r&quot; and points in the direction of increasing &quot;θ&quot;. These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; directions, denoted formula_52 and formula_53 respectively:
formula_54 and formula_55

One can differentiate to find velocity:
formula_56
where is the angular velocity .

This result for the velocity matches expectations that the velocity should be directed tangentially to the circle, and that the magnitude of the velocity should be . Differentiating again, and noting that
formula_57
we find that the acceleration, a is:
formula_58

Thus, the radial and tangential components of the acceleration are:
formula_59 and formula_60
where is the magnitude of the velocity (the speed).

These equations express mathematically that, in the case of an object that moves along a circular path with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a perpendicular component that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal acceleration), and a parallel, or tangential component, that changes the speed.

=== General planar motion ===


==== Polar coordinates ====

The above results can be derived perhaps more simply in polar coordinates, and at the same time extended to general motion within a plane, as shown next. Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector uρ and an angular unit vector uθ, as shown above. A particle at position r is described by:

formula_61

where the notation &quot;ρ&quot; is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of &quot;R&quot; to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector uρ travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as r(&quot;t&quot;). Unit vector uθ also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to uρ. Thus, uρ and uθ form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path travelled by the particle. By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that uρ and uθ form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as r(&quot;t&quot;).

When the particle moves, its velocity is

: formula_62

To evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector uρ is needed. Because uρ is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change duρ has a component only perpendicular to uρ. When the trajectory r(&quot;t&quot;) rotates an amount d&quot;θ&quot;, uρ, which points in the same direction as r(&quot;t&quot;), also rotates by d&quot;θ&quot;. See image above. Therefore, the change in uρ is

: formula_63

or

: formula_64

In a similar fashion, the rate of change of uθ is found. As with uρ, uθ is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to uρ while the trajectory r(&quot;t&quot;) rotates an amount d&quot;θ&quot;, uθ, which is orthogonal to r(&quot;t&quot;), also rotates by d&quot;θ&quot;. See image above. Therefore, the change duθ is orthogonal to uθ and proportional to d&quot;θ&quot; (see image above):

: formula_65

The equation above shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if duρ is positive with d&quot;θ&quot;, then duθ must decrease.

Substituting the derivative of uρ into the expression for velocity:

: formula_66

To obtain the acceleration, another time differentiation is done:
: formula_67

Substituting the derivatives of uρ and uθ, the acceleration of the particle is:
: formula_68

As a particular example, if the particle moves in a circle of constant radius &quot;R&quot;, then d&quot;ρ&quot;/d&quot;t&quot; = 0, v = vθ, and:

formula_69

where formula_70

These results agree with those above for nonuniform circular motion. See also the article on non-uniform circular motion. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.

For trajectories other than circular motion, for example, the more general trajectory envisioned in the image above, the instantaneous center of rotation and radius of curvature of the trajectory are related only indirectly to the coordinate system defined by uρ and uθ and to the length |r(&quot;t&quot;)| = &quot;ρ&quot;. Consequently, in the general case, it is not straightforward to disentangle the centripetal and Euler terms from the above general acceleration equation. To deal directly with this issue, local coordinates are preferable, as discussed next.

==== Local coordinates ====

Local coordinates mean a set of coordinates that travel with the particle, and have orientation determined by the path of the particle. Unit vectors are formed as shown in the image at right, both tangential and normal to the path. This coordinate system sometimes is referred to as &quot;intrinsic&quot; or &quot;path coordinates&quot; or &quot;nt-coordinates&quot;, for &quot;normal-tangential&quot;, referring to these unit vectors. These coordinates are a very special example of a more general concept of local coordinates from the theory of differential forms.

Distance along the path of the particle is the arc length &quot;s&quot;, considered to be a known function of time.

: formula_71

A center of curvature is defined at each position &quot;s&quot; located a distance &quot;ρ&quot; (the radius of curvature) from the curve on a line along the normal un (&quot;s&quot;). The required distance &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) at arc length &quot;s&quot; is defined in terms of the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve, which in turn is determined by the path itself. If the orientation of the tangent relative to some starting position is &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), then &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is defined by the derivative d&quot;θ&quot;/d&quot;s&quot;:

: formula_72

The radius of curvature usually is taken as positive (that is, as an absolute value), while the &quot;curvature&quot; &quot;κ&quot; is a signed quantity.

A geometric approach to finding the center of curvature and the radius of curvature uses a limiting process leading to the osculating circle. See image above.

Using these coordinates, the motion along the path is viewed as a succession of circular paths of ever-changing center, and at each position &quot;s&quot; constitutes non-uniform circular motion at that position with radius &quot;ρ&quot;. The local value of the angular rate of rotation then is given by:

: formula_73
with the local speed &quot;v&quot; given by:

: formula_74

As for the other examples above, because unit vectors cannot change magnitude, their rate of change is always perpendicular to their direction (see the left-hand insert in the image above):

: formula_75 formula_76
Consequently, the velocity and acceleration are:
: formula_77
and using the chain-rule of differentiation:

: formula_78 with the tangential acceleration formula_79

In this local coordinate system, the acceleration resembles the expression for nonuniform circular motion with the local radius &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), and the centripetal acceleration is identified as the second term.

Extending this approach to three dimensional space curves leads to the Frenet–Serret formulas.

===== Alternative approach =====

Looking at the image above, one might wonder whether adequate account has been taken of the difference in curvature between &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot; + d&quot;s&quot;) in computing the arc length as d&quot;s&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)d&quot;θ&quot;. Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on curvature.

To introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In terms of arc length &quot;s&quot;, let the path be described as:
formula_80

Then an incremental displacement along the path d&quot;s&quot; is described by:
formula_81

where primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to &quot;s&quot;. The magnitude of this displacement is d&quot;s&quot;, showing that:
: formula_82 (Eq. 1)

This displacement is necessarily a tangent to the curve at &quot;s&quot;, showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:
formula_83
while the outward unit vector normal to the curve is
formula_84

Orthogonality can be verified by showing that the vector dot product is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of Eq. 1. Using the tangent vector, the angle &quot;θ&quot; of the tangent to the curve is given by:
formula_85 and formula_86

The radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:
formula_87

The derivative of &quot;θ&quot; can be found from that for sin&quot;θ&quot;:
formula_88

Now:
formula_89
in which the denominator is unity. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:
formula_90
where the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of Eq. 1:
formula_91
With these results, the acceleration can be found:
formula_92
as can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors ut(&quot;s&quot;) and un(&quot;s&quot;). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius &quot;ρ&quot;. Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force. From a qualitative standpoint, the path can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius.

This result for acceleration agrees with that found earlier. However, in this approach, the question of the change in radius of curvature with &quot;s&quot; is handled completely formally, consistent with a geometric interpretation, but not relying upon it, thereby avoiding any questions the image above might suggest about neglecting the variation in &quot;ρ&quot;.
===== Example: circular motion =====

To illustrate the above formulas, let &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; be given as:
: formula_93

Then:
: formula_94

which can be recognized as a circular path around the origin with radius &quot;α&quot;. The position &quot;s&quot; = 0 corresponds to [&quot;α&quot;, 0], or 3 o&#x27;clock. To use the above formalism, the derivatives are needed:

: formula_95
: formula_96

With these results, one can verify that:
: formula_97

The unit vectors can also be found:
: formula_98

which serve to show that &quot;s&quot; = 0 is located at position [&quot;ρ&quot;, 0] and &quot;s&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;π/2 at [0, &quot;ρ&quot;], which agrees with the original expressions for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. In other words, &quot;s&quot; is measured counterclockwise around the circle from 3 o&#x27;clock. Also, the derivatives of these vectors can be found:
: formula_99
: formula_100

To obtain velocity and acceleration, a time-dependence for &quot;s&quot; is necessary. For counterclockwise motion at variable speed &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;):
: formula_101
where &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the speed and &quot;t&quot; is time, and &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot; = 0) = 0. Then:
: formula_102
: formula_103
: formula_104
where it already is established that α = ρ. This acceleration is the standard result for non-uniform circular motion.

<doc id="7538" wikidata="Q218341" url="?curid=7538" title="Checksum">
<text>A checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity.

The procedure which generates this checksum is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm. Depending on its design goals, a good checksum algorithm usually outputs a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input. This is especially true of cryptographic hash functions, which may be used to detect many data corruption errors and verify overall data integrity; if the computed checksum for the current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum, there is a very high probability the data has not been accidentally altered or corrupted.

Checksum functions are related to hash functions, fingerprints, randomization functions, and cryptographic hash functions. However, each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals. For instance, a function returning the start of a string can provide a hash appropriate for some applications but will never be a suitable checksum. Checksums are used as cryptographic primitives in larger authentication algorithms. For cryptographic systems with these two specific design goals, see HMAC.

Check digits and parity bits are special cases of checksums, appropriate for small blocks of data (such as Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, computer words, single bytes, etc.). Some error-correcting codes are based on special checksums which not only detect common errors but also allow the original data to be recovered in certain cases.

==Algorithms==
===Parity byte or parity word===
The simplest checksum algorithm is the so-called longitudinal parity check, which breaks the data into &quot;words&quot; with a fixed number of bits, and then computes the bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of all those words. The result is appended to the message as an extra word. In simpler terms, for =1 this means adding a bit to the end of the data bits to guarantee that there is an even number of &#x27;1&#x27;s. To check the integrity of a message, the receiver computes the bitwise exclusive or of all its words, including the checksum; if the result is not a word consisting of zeros, the receiver knows a transmission error occurred.

With this checksum, any transmission error which flips a single bit of the message, or an odd number of bits, will be detected as an incorrect checksum. However, an error that affects two bits will not be detected if those bits lie at the same position in two distinct words. Also swapping of two or more words will not be detected. If the affected bits are independently chosen at random, the probability of a two-bit error being undetected is .

===Sum complement===

A variant of the previous algorithm is to add all the &quot;words&quot; as unsigned binary numbers, discarding any overflow bits, and append the two&#x27;s complement of the total as the checksum. To validate a message, the receiver adds all the words in the same manner, including the checksum; if the result is not a word full of zeros, an error must have occurred. This variant, too, detects any single-bit error, but the pro modular sum is used in SAE J1708.

===Position-dependent===

The simple checksums described above fail to detect some common errors which affect many bits at once, such as changing the order of data words, or inserting or deleting words with all bits set to zero. The checksum algorithms most used in practice, such as Fletcher&#x27;s checksum, Adler-32, and cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs), address these weaknesses by considering not only the value of each word but also its position in the sequence. This feature generally increases the cost of computing the checksum.

===Fuzzy checksum===
The idea of fuzzy checksum was developed for detection of email spam by building up cooperative databases from multiple ISPs of email suspected to be spam. The content of such spam may often vary in its details, which would render normal checksumming ineffective. By contrast, a &quot;fuzzy checksum&quot; reduces the body text to its characteristic minimum, then generates a checksum in the usual manner. This greatly increases the chances of slightly different spam emails producing the same checksum. The ISP spam detection software, such as SpamAssassin, of co-operating ISPs, submits checksums of all emails to the centralised service such as DCC. If the count of a submitted fuzzy checksum exceeds a certain threshold, the database notes that this probably indicates spam. ISP service users similarly generate a fuzzy checksum on each of their emails and request the service for a spam likelihood.

===General considerations===

A message that is bits long can be viewed as a corner of the -dimensional hypercube. The effect of a checksum algorithm that yields an -bit checksum is to map each -bit message to a corner of a larger hypercube, with dimension . The corners of this hypercube represent all possible received messages. The valid received messages (those that have the correct checksum) comprise a smaller set, with only corners.

A single-bit transmission error then corresponds to a displacement from a valid corner (the correct message and checksum) to one of the adjacent corners. An error which affects bits moves the message to a corner which is steps removed from its correct corner. The goal of a good checksum algorithm is to spread the valid corners as far from each other as possible, to increase the likelihood &quot;typical&quot; transmission errors will end up in an invalid corner.

<text>The City University of New York (CUNY, pronounced , ) is the public university system of New York City. It is the largest urban university system in the United States, comprising 25 campuses: eleven senior colleges, seven community colleges, and seven professional institutions. The university enrolls more than 275,000 students and counts thirteen Nobel Prize winners and twenty-four MacArthur Fellows among its alumni.

The oldest constituent college of CUNY, City College of New York, was originally founded in 1847 and became the first free public institution of higher learning in the United States. In 1960, John R. Everett became the first chancellor of the Municipal College System of New York City, later known as the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY, established by New York state legislation in 1961 and signed into law by governor Nelson Rockefeller, was an amalgamation of existing institutions and a new graduate school.

The system was governed by the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, created in 1926, and later renamed the Board of Trustees of CUNY in 1979. The institutions merged into CUNY included the Free Academy (later City College of New York), the Female Normal and High School (later Hunter College), Brooklyn College, and Queens College. CUNY has historically provided accessible education, especially to those excluded or unable to afford private universities. The first community college in New York City was established in 1955 with shared funding between the state and the city, but unlike the senior colleges, community college students had to pay tuition.

The integration of CUNY&#x27;s colleges into a single university system took place in 1961, under a chancellor and with state funding. The Graduate Center, serving as the principal doctorate-granting institution, was also established that year. In 1964, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. extended the senior colleges&#x27; free tuition policy to community colleges. The 1960s saw student protests demanding more racial diversity and academic representation in CUNY, leading to the establishment of Medgar Evers College and the implementation of the Open Admissions policy in 1970. This policy dramatically increased student diversity but also introduced challenges like low retention rates. The 1976 fiscal crisis ended the free tuition policy, leading to the introduction of tuition fees for all CUNY colleges.

==History==

===Founding===
In 1960, John R. Everett became the first chancellor of the Municipal College System of the City of New York, later renamed CUNY, for a salary of $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms). CUNY was created in 1961, by New York State legislation, signed into law by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. The legislation integrated existing institutions and a new graduate school into a coordinated system of higher education for the city, under the control of the &quot;Board of Higher Education of the City of New York&quot;, which had been created by New York State legislation in 1926. By 1979, the Board of Higher Education had become the &quot;Board of Trustees of the CUNY&quot;.

The institutions that were merged to create CUNY were:

* The Free Academy – Founded in 1847 by Townsend Harris, it was fashioned as &quot;a Free Academy for the purpose of extending the benefits of education gratuitously to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the city and county of New York.&quot; The Free Academy later became the City College of New York.
* The Female Normal and High School – Founded in 1870, and later renamed the Normal College. It would be renamed again in 1914 to Hunter College. During the early 20th century, Hunter College expanded into the Bronx, with what became Herbert Lehman College.
* Brooklyn College – Founded in 1930.
* Queens College – Founded in 1937.

===Accessible education===
CUNY has served a diverse student body, especially those excluded from or unable to afford private universities. Its four-year colleges offered a high-quality, tuition-free education to the poor, the working class, and the immigrants of New York City who met the grade requirements for matriculated status. During the post-World War I era, when some Ivy League universities, such as Yale and Columbia, discriminated against Jews, many Jewish academics and intellectuals studied and taught at CUNY. The City College of New York developed a reputation of being &quot;the Harvard of the proletariat.&quot;

As New York City&#x27;s population and public college enrollment grew during the early 20th century and the city struggled for resources, the municipal colleges slowly began adopting selective tuition, also known as instructional fees, for a handful of courses and programs. During the Great Depression, with funding for public colleges severely constrained, limits were imposed on the size of the colleges&#x27; free Day Sessions, and tuition was imposed upon students deemed &quot;competent&quot; but not academically qualified for the day program. Most of these &quot;limited matriculation&quot; students enrolled in the Evening Sessions, and paid tuition. Additionally, as the population of New York grew, CUNY was not able to accommodate the demand for higher education. Higher and higher requirements for admission were imposed; in 1965, a student seeking admission to CUNY needed an average grade of 92 or A−. This helped to ensure that the student population of CUNY remained largely white and middle-class.

Demand in the United States for higher education rapidly grew after World War II, and during the mid-1940s a movement began to create community colleges to provide accessible education and training. In New York City, however, the community college movement was constrained by many factors including &quot;financial problems, narrow perceptions of responsibility, organizational weaknesses, adverse political factors, and other competing priorities.&quot;

Community colleges would have drawn from the same city coffers that were funding the senior colleges, and city higher education officials were of the view that the state should finance them. It was not until 1955, under a shared-funding arrangement with New York State, that New York City established its first community college, on Staten Island. Unlike the day college students attending the city&#x27;s public baccalaureate colleges for free, community college students had to pay tuition fees under the state-city funding formula. Community college students paid tuition fees for approximately 10 years.

Over time, tuition fees for limited-matriculated students became an important source of system revenues. In fall 1957, for example, nearly 36,000 attended Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens and City Colleges for free, but another 24,000 paid tuition fees of up to $300 a year ($ in current dollar terms). Undergraduate tuition and other student fees in 1957 comprised 17 percent of the colleges&#x27; $46.8 million in revenues, about $7.74 million ($ in current dollar terms).

Three community colleges had been established by early 1961 when New York City&#x27;s public colleges were codified by the state as a single university with a chancellor at the helm and an infusion of state funds. But the city&#x27;s slowness in creating the community colleges as demand for college seats was intensifying and had resulted in mounting frustration, particularly on the part of minorities, that college opportunities were not available to them.

In 1964, as New York City&#x27;s Board of Higher Education moved to take full responsibility for the community colleges, city officials extended the senior colleges&#x27; free tuition policy to them, a change that was included by Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. in his budget plans and took effect with the 1964–65 academic year.

Calls for greater access to public higher education from the black and Puerto Rican communities in New York, especially in Brooklyn, led to the founding of &quot;Community College Number 7,&quot; later Medgar Evers College, in 1966–1967. In 1969, a group of black and Puerto Rican students occupied City College and demanded the racial integration of CUNY, which at the time had an overwhelmingly white student body.

===Student protests===
Students at some campuses became increasingly frustrated with the university&#x27;s and Board of Higher Education&#x27;s handling of university administration. At Baruch College in 1967, over a thousand students protested the plan to make the college an upper-division school limited to junior, senior, and graduate students. At Brooklyn College in 1968, students attempted a sit-in to demand the admission of more black and Puerto Rican students and additional black studies curriculum. Students at Hunter College also demanded a Black studies program. Members of the SEEK program, which provided academic support for underprepared and underprivileged students, staged a building takeover at Queens College in 1969 to protest the decisions of the program&#x27;s director, who would later be replaced by a black professor. Puerto Rican students at Bronx Community College filed a report with the New York State Division of Human Rights in 1970, contending that the intellectual level of the college was inferior and discriminatory. Hunter College was crippled for several days by a protest of 2,000 students who had a list of demands focusing on more student representation in college administration. Across CUNY, students boycotted their campuses in 1970 to protest a rise in student fees and other issues, including the proposed (and later implemented) open admissions plan.

Like many college campuses in 1970, CUNY faced a number of protests and demonstrations after the Kent State massacre and Cambodian Campaign. The Administrative Council of the City University of New York sent U.S. president Richard Nixon a telegram in 1970 stating, &quot;No nation can long endure the alienation of the best of its young people.&quot; Some colleges, including John Jay College of Criminal Justice, historically the &quot;college for cops,&quot; held teach-ins in addition to student and faculty protests.

In April 2024, CUNY students joined other campuses across the United States in protests against the Israel–Hamas war. The student protestors demanded that CUNY divest from companies with ties to Israel and that CUNY officials cancel any upcoming trips to Israel and protect students involved in the demonstrations.

===Open admissions===
Under pressure from community activists and CUNY Chancellor Albert Bowker, the Board of Higher Education (BHE) approved an open admissions plan in 1966, but it was not scheduled to be fully implemented until 1975. However, in 1969, students and faculty across CUNY participated in rallies, student strikes, and class boycotts demanding an end to CUNY&#x27;s restrictive admissions policies. CUNY administrators and Mayor John Lindsay expressed support for these demands, and the BHE voted to implement the plan immediately in the fall of 1970.

All high school graduates were guaranteed entrance to the university without having to fulfill traditional requirements such as exams or grades. The policy nearly doubled the number of students enrolled in the CUNY system to 35,000 (compared to 20,000 the year before). Black and Hispanic student enrollment increased threefold. Remedial education, to supplement the training of under-prepared students, became a significant part of CUNY&#x27;s offerings. Additionally, ethnic and Black Studies programs and centers were instituted on many CUNY campuses, contributing to the growth of similar programs nationwide.

However, retention of students in CUNY during this period was low; two-thirds of students enrolled in the early 1970s left within four years without graduating.

===Financial crisis of 1976===
In fall 1976, during New York City&#x27;s fiscal crisis, the free tuition policy was discontinued under pressure from the federal government, the financial community that had a role in rescuing the city from bankruptcy, and New York State, which would take over the funding of CUNY&#x27;s senior colleges. Tuition, which had been in place in the State University of New York system since 1963, was instituted at all CUNY colleges.

Meanwhile, CUNY students were added to the state&#x27;s need-based Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which had been created to help private colleges. Full-time students who met the income eligibility criteria were permitted to receive TAP, ensuring for the first time that financial hardship would deprive no CUNY student of a college education. Within a few years, the federal government would create its own need-based program, known as Pell Grants, providing the neediest students with a tuition-free college education. Joseph S. Murphy was Chancellor of the City University of New York from 1982 to 1990, when he resigned. CUNY at the time was the third-largest university in the United States, with over 180,000 students.

By 2011, nearly six of ten full-time undergraduates qualified for a tuition-free education at CUNY due in large measure to state, federal and CUNY financial aid programs. CUNY&#x27;s enrollment dipped after tuition was re-established, and there were further enrollment declines through the 1980s and into the 1990s.

===Financial crisis of 1995===
In 1995, CUNY suffered another fiscal crisis when Governor George Pataki proposed a drastic cut in state financing. Faculty cancelled classes and students staged protests. By May, CUNY adopted deep cuts to college budgets and class offerings. By June, to save money spent on remedial programs, CUNY adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges: students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, this a departure from the 1970 Open Admissions program. That year&#x27;s final state budget cut funding by $102 million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and offering a retirement incentive plan for faculty.

In 1999, a task force appointed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued a report that described CUNY as &quot;an institution adrift&quot; and called for an improved, more cohesive university structure and management, as well as more consistent academic standards. Following the report, Matthew Goldstein, a mathematician and City College graduate who had led CUNY&#x27;s Baruch College and briefly, Adelphi University, was appointed chancellor. CUNY ended its policy of open admissions to its four-year colleges, raised its admissions standards at its most selective four-year colleges (Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens), and required new enrollees who needed remediation to begin their studies at a CUNY open-admissions community college.

===2010 onward===
CUNY&#x27;s enrollment of degree-credit students reached 220,727 in 2005 and 262,321 in 2010 as the university broadened its academic offerings. The university added more than 2,000 full-time faculty positions, opened new schools and programs, and expanded the university&#x27;s fundraising efforts to help pay for them. Fundraising increased from $35 million in 2000 to more than $200 million in 2012.

By autumn 2013, all CUNY undergraduates were required to take an administration-dictated common core of courses which have been claimed to meet specific &quot;learning outcomes&quot; or standards. Since the courses are accepted university-wide, the administration claims it will be easier for students to transfer course credits between CUNY colleges. It also reduced the number of core courses some CUNY colleges had required, to a level below national norms, particularly in the sciences. The program is the target of several lawsuits by students and faculty, and was the subject of a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote by the faculty, who rejected it by an overwhelming 92% margin.

Chancellor Goldstein retired on July 1, 2013, and was replaced on June 1, 2014, by James Milliken, president of the University of Nebraska, and a graduate of the University of Nebraska and New York University School of Law. Milliken retired at the end of the 2018 academic year and moved on to become the chancellor for the University of Texas system.

In 2018, CUNY opened its 25th campus, the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies, named after former president Joseph S. Murphy and combining some forms and functions of the Murphy Institute that were housed at the CUNY School of Professional Studies.

On February 13, 2019, the board of trustees voted to appoint Queens College president Felix V. Matos Rodriguez as the chancellor of the City University of New York. Matos became both the first Latino and minority educator to head the university. He assumed the post May 1.

==Enrollment and demographics==
CUNY is the fourth-largest university system in the United States by enrollment, behind the California State University, State University of New York (SUNY), and University of California systems. More than 271,000-degree-credit students, continuing, and professional education students are enrolled at campuses located in all five New York City boroughs.

The university has one of the most diverse student bodies in the United States, with students hailing from around the world, although most students live in New York City. The black, white and Hispanic undergraduate populations each comprise more than a quarter of the student body, and Asian undergraduates make up 18 percent. Fifty-eight percent are female, and 28 percent are 25 or older. In the 2017–2018 award year, 144,380 CUNY students received the Federal Pell Grant.

=== CUNY Citizenship Now! ===
Founded in 1997 by immigration lawyer Allan Wernick, CUNY Citizenship Now! is an immigration assistance organization that provides free and confidential immigration law services to help individuals and families on their path to U.S. citizenship. In 2021, CUNY launched a College Immigrant Ambassador Program in partnership with the New York City Department of Education.

==Academics==

==Component institutions==

==Management structure==
The forerunner of today&#x27;s City University of New York was governed by the Board of Education of New York City. Members of the Board of Education, chaired by the president of the board, served as &quot;ex officio&quot; trustees. For the next four decades, the board members continued to serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; trustees of the College of the City of New York and the city&#x27;s other municipal college, the Normal College of the City of New York.

In 1900, the New York State Legislature created separate boards of trustees for the College of the City of New York and the Normal College, which became Hunter College in 1914. In 1926, the legislature established the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, which assumed supervision of both municipal colleges.

In 1961, the New York State Legislature established the City University of New York, uniting what had become seven municipal colleges at the time: the City College of New York, Hunter College, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Staten Island Community College, Bronx Community College and Queensborough Community College. In 1979, the CUNY Financing and Governance Act was adopted by the State and the Board of Higher Education became the City University of New York board of trustees.

Today, the City University is governed by the board of trustees composed of 17 members, ten of whom are appointed by the governor of New York &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate,&quot; and five by the mayor of New York City &quot;with the advice and consent of the senate.&quot; The final two trustees are &quot;ex officio&quot; members. One is the chair of the university&#x27;s student senate, and the other is non-voting and is the chair of the university&#x27;s faculty senate. Both the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to include at least one resident of each of New York City&#x27;s five boroughs. Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years. The chancellor is elected by the board of trustees, and is the &quot;chief educational and administrative officer&quot; of the City University.

The administrative offices are in Midtown Manhattan.

==Faculty==
CUNY employs 6,700 full-time faculty members and over 10,000 adjunct faculty members. Faculty and staff are represented by the Professional Staff Congress (PSC), a labor union and chapter of the American Federation of Teachers.

==Public Safety Department==

CUNY has a unified public safety department, the City University of New York Public Safety Department, with branches at each of the 26 CUNY campuses. The New York City Police Department is the primary policing and investigation agency within the New York City as per the NYC Charter, which includes all CUNY campuses and facilities.

The Public Safety Department came under heavy criticism from student groups, after several students protesting tuition increases tried to occupy the lobby of the Baruch College. The occupiers were forcibly removed from the area and several were arrested on November 21, 2011.

=== Antisemitism at CUNY ===
In recent years, there have been a number of antisemitic incidents on CUNY campuses, including:

* In March 2014, Brooklyn College settled the Title VI complaint that the Zionist Organization of America (&quot;ZOA&quot;) had filed against its antisemitic discrimination.
* In 2017, a CUNY admin was recorded saying that there were too many Jews on campus.
* In 2020, a CUNY student was arrested for spray-painting antisemitic graffiti on a campus building. 
* In 2021, a survey found that nearly one in four CUNY students had experienced antisemitism on campus. The survey also found that Jewish students were more likely to report feeling unsafe on campus than students of other faiths.
* In May 2021, a student at John Jay posted a picture of Adolf Hitler on Instagram with a message saying &quot;We need another Hitler today.&quot; A group of Jewish students met with Karol Mason, the President of the college, who refused to condemn the action publicly.
* The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cited CUNY in 2021 for failing to protect a Jewish professor after the PSC discriminated against him and subjected him to a hostile work environment on the basis of his Jewish faith.

CUNY has taken steps to address antisemitism on its campuses. In 2020, the university created a task force to combat antisemitism. The task force has developed a number of initiatives, including training for faculty and staff on how to identify and address antisemitism.

In June 2024, the United States Department of Education concluded that CUNY has failed to protect Jewish students from discrimination following the October 7 attacks. CUNY&#x27;s Hunter College also faced scrutiny for incidents dating back to 2021. In response, Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez stated that CUNY is dedicated to maintaining a discrimination-free and hate-free environment, and that new measures will ensure consistent and transparent investigation and resolution of complaints.

==City University Television (CUNY TV)==

CUNY also has a broadcast TV service, CUNY TV (channel 75 on Spectrum, digital HD broadcast channel 25.3), which airs telecourses, classic and foreign films, magazine shows, and panel discussions in foreign languages.

==City University Film Festival (CUNYFF)==
The City University Film Festival is CUNY&#x27;s official film festival. The festival was founded in 2009.

==Notable alumni==

CUNY graduates include 13 Nobel laureates, 2 Fields Medalists, 2 U.S. Secretaries of State, a Supreme Court Justice, several New York City mayors, members of Congress, state legislators, scientists, artists, and Olympians.

<text>In theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and explores the relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is part of the field of computational complexity.

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==
===Problem instances===
A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of &quot;instances&quot; together with a set (possibly empty) of &quot;solutions&quot; for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is &quot;yes&quot; if the number is prime and &quot;no&quot; otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is &quot;no&quot;). Stated another way, the &quot;instance&quot; is a particular input to the problem, and the &quot;solution&quot; is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the travelling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany&#x27;s 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

===Decision problems as formal languages===

Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a type of computational problem where the answer is either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; (alternatively, 1 or 0). A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer &quot;yes&quot;, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary graph. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem—that is, the output is not just yes or no. Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem.

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples formula_1 such that the relation formula_2 holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. The input size is typically measured in bits. Complexity theory studies how algorithms scale as input size increases. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with formula_3 vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with formula_4 vertices?

If the input size is formula_4, the time taken can be expressed as a function of formula_4. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity formula_7 is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size formula_4. If formula_7 is a polynomial in formula_4, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm. Cobham&#x27;s thesis argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial-time algorithm.

==Machine models and complexity measures==

===Turing machine===
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, cellular automata, lambda calculus or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see non-deterministic algorithm.

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random-access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine formula_11 on input formula_12 is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;). A Turing machine formula_11 is said to operate within time formula_14 if the time required by formula_11 on each input of length formula_4 is at most formula_14. A decision problem formula_18 can be solved in time formula_14 if there exists a Turing machine operating in time formula_14 that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time formula_14 on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(formula_14).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity.

The complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using big O notation.

===Best, worst and average case complexity===

The best, worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size formula_4 may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
# Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size formula_4.
# Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a probability distribution over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size formula_4.
# Amortized analysis: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.
# Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size formula_4.
The order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of discrete uniform distribution), amortized, worst.

For example, the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort addresses the problem of sorting a list of integers. The worst-case is when the pivot is always the largest or smallest value in the list (so the list is never divided). In this case, the algorithm takes time O(formula_27). If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is formula_28. The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing formula_28 time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), it is helpful to demonstrate upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm to solve a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms. To show an upper bound formula_7 on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most formula_7. However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase &quot;all possible algorithms&quot; includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of formula_7 for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than formula_7.

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if formula_34, in big O notation one would write formula_35.
==Complexity classes==
===Defining complexity classes===
A complexity class is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on function problems, counting problems, optimization problems, promise problems, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, Boolean circuits, quantum Turing machines, monotone circuits, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that is being bounded and the bound: These two properties are usually stated together, such as &quot;polynomial time&quot;, &quot;logarithmic space&quot;, &quot;constant depth&quot;, etc.

Some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time formula_14. (This complexity class is known as DTIME(formula_14).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function formula_14 often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language formula_39 can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that &quot;the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related&quot; . This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is FP.

===Important complexity classes===
Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:

Logarithmic-space classes do not account for the space required to represent the problem.

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by Savitch&#x27;s theorem.

Other important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using Boolean circuits; and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines. #P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems. ALL is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===

For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(formula_4) is contained in DTIME(formula_27), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the time hierarchy theorem states that
formula_42.

The space hierarchy theorem states that
formula_43.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===

Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem formula_44 can be solved using an algorithm for formula_45, formula_44 is no more difficult than formula_45, and we say that formula_44 &quot;reduces&quot; to formula_45. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem formula_44 is &quot;hard&quot; for a class of problems formula_51 if every problem in formula_51 can be reduced to formula_44. Thus no problem in formula_51 is harder than formula_44, since an algorithm for formula_44 allows us to solve any problem in formula_51. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.

If a problem formula_44 is in formula_51 and hard for formula_51, then formula_44 is said to be &quot;complete&quot; for formula_51. This means that formula_44 is the hardest problem in formula_51. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that formula_44 is one of the hardest problems in formula_51.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P = NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, formula_67, to another problem, formula_68, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for formula_68. This is because a polynomial-time solution to formula_68 would yield a polynomial-time solution to formula_67. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.

==Important open problems==
===P versus NP problem===
The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. The complexity class NP, on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution. If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems. The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===
It was shown by Ladner that if formula_72 then there exist problems in formula_73 that are neither in formula_74 nor formula_73-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in formula_74 or to be formula_73-complete.

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in formula_74, formula_73-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai and Eugene Luks has run time formula_80 for graphs with formula_4 vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.

The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than formula_82. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in formula_73 and in formula_84 (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is formula_73-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., formula_73 will equal formula_84). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time formula_88 to factor an odd integer formula_4. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor&#x27;s algorithm, does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn&#x27;t say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===
Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance formula_90, but it is possible that formula_91. If formula_74 is not equal to formula_73, then formula_74 is not equal to formula_95 either. Since there are many known complexity classes between formula_74 and formula_95, such as formula_98, formula_99, formula_100, formula_101, formula_102, formula_103, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, formula_84 is the class containing the complement problems (i.e. problems with the &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; answers reversed) of formula_73 problems. It is believed that formula_73 is not equal to formula_84; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then formula_74 is not equal to formula_73, since formula_110. Thus if formula_111 we would have formula_112 whence formula_113.

Similarly, it is not known if formula_114 (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in formula_74 or equal to formula_74. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as formula_117 and formula_118, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

It is suspected that formula_74 and formula_99 are equal. However, it is currently open if formula_121.

==Intractability== 

A problem that can theoretically be solved, but requires impractical and finite resources (e.g., time) to do so, is known as an . Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a , literally &quot;a problem that can be handled&quot;. The term &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;cannot be done&quot;) is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;&quot;, though this risks confusion with a feasible solution in mathematical optimization.

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions (formula_74, formula_123); this is known as the Cobham–Edmonds thesis. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If formula_73 is not the same as formula_74, then NP-hard problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large degree or large leading coefficient grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in formula_74 does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in formula_74, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.

To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes formula_128 operations before halting. For small formula_4, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does formula_130 operations each second, the program would run for about formula_131 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes formula_132 operations is practical until formula_4 gets relatively large.

Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, formula_134, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even formula_135 or formula_27 algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.

==Continuous complexity theory==
Continuous complexity theory can refer to complexity theory of problems that involve continuous functions that are approximated by discretizations, as studied in numerical analysis. One approach to complexity theory of numerical analysis is information based complexity.

Continuous complexity theory can also refer to complexity theory of the use of analog computation, which uses continuous dynamical systems and differential equations. Control theory can be considered a form of computation and differential equations are used in the modelling of continuous-time and hybrid discrete-continuous-time systems.

==History==
An early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the Euclidean algorithm done by Gabriel Lamé in 1844.

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

The beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper &quot;On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms&quot; by Juris Hartmanis and Richard E. Stearns, which laid out the definitions of time complexity and space complexity, and proved the hierarchy theorems. In addition, in 1965 Edmonds suggested to consider a &quot;good&quot; algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.

Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include John Myhill&#x27;s definition of linear bounded automata (Myhill 1960), Raymond Smullyan&#x27;s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as Hisao Yamada&#x27;s paper on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, Boris Trakhtenbrot (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure. As he remembers:

In 1967, Manuel Blum formulated a set of axioms (now known as Blum axioms) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called speed-up theorem. The field began to flourish in 1971 when Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin proved the existence of practically relevant problems that are NP-complete. In 1972, Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, &quot;Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems&quot;, in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.

<doc id="7546" wikidata="Q220437" url="?curid=7546" title="Camelot">
<text>Camelot is a legendary castle and court associated with King Arthur. Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, since the Lancelot-Grail cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur&#x27;s realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world.

Medieval texts locate it somewhere in Great Britain and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its unspecified geography being perfect for chivalric romance writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the &quot;real Camelot&quot; have occurred since the 15th century and continue today in popular works and for tourism purposes.

== Etymology ==
The name&#x27;s derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romances, including &quot;Camaalot&quot;, &quot;Camalot&quot;, &quot;Chamalot&quot;, &quot;Camehelot&quot; (sometimes read as &quot;Camchilot&quot;), &quot;Camaaloth&quot;, &quot;Caamalot&quot;, &quot;Camahaloth&quot;, &quot;Camaelot&quot;, &quot;Kamaalot&quot;, &quot;Kamaaloth&quot;, &quot;Kaamalot&quot;, &quot;Kamahaloth&quot;, &quot;Kameloth&quot;, &quot;Kamaelot&quot;, &quot;Kamelot&quot;, &quot;Kaamelot&quot;, &quot;Cameloth&quot;, and &quot;Gamalaot&quot;. Arthurian scholar Ernst Brugger suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthur&#x27;s final battle, the Battle of Camlann, in Welsh tradition. Roger Sherman Loomis believed it was derived from &quot;Cavalon&quot;, a place name that he suggested was a corruption of Avalon (under the influence of the Breton place name &quot;Cavallon&quot;). He further suggested that Cavalon became Arthur&#x27;s capital due to confusion with Arthur&#x27;s other traditional court at Caerleon (&quot;Caer Lleon&quot; in Welsh).

Others have suggested a derivation from the British Iron Age and Romano-British place name Camulodunum, one of the first capitals of Roman Britain and which would have significance in Romano-British culture. Indeed, John Morris, the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the Roman Empire and the history of Sub-Roman Britain, suggested in his book &quot;The Age of Arthur&quot; that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name &quot;Camelot&quot; of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of Britannia (Camulodunum) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where Chrétien de Troyes would have encountered the name Camulodunum, or why he would render it as &quot;Camaalot&quot;, though Urban T. Holmes argued Chrétien could have had access to Book 2 of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, where it is rendered as &quot;Camaloduno&quot;.

== Medieval literature ==
Arthur&#x27;s court at Camelot is mentioned for the first time in Chrétien&#x27;s poem &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts. In the C manuscript (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, fonds français 794, folio 27r), which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretien&#x27;s original text, instead of the place name there is the Old French phrase &quot;con lui plot&quot;, meaning &quot;as he pleased&quot;. The other manuscripts spell the name variously as &quot;Chamalot&quot; (MS A, f. f. 196r), &quot;Camehelot&quot; (MS E, f. 1r), &quot;Chamaalot&quot; (MS G, f. 34f), and &quot;Camalot&quot; (MS T, f. 41v); the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V (Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725). Camelot is mentioned only in passing and is not described:

Nothing in Chrétien&#x27;s poem suggests the level of importance Camelot would have in later romances. For Chrétien, Arthur&#x27;s chief court was in Caerleon in Wales; this was the king&#x27;s primary base in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and subsequent literature. Chrétien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles.

It is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate cycles, that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey&#x27;s earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town. Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. One exception is &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, which locates Arthur&#x27;s court at &quot;Camelot&quot;; however, in Britain, Arthur&#x27;s court was generally located at Caerleon, or at Carlisle, which is usually identified with the &quot;Carduel&quot; of the French romances.


The &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from Astolat. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, St. Stephen&#x27;s, originally established by Josephus, the son of Joseph of Arimathea, is the religious centre for Arthur&#x27;s Knights of the Round Table. There, Arthur and Guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the Round Table, created by Merlin and Uther Pendragon; it is here that Galahad conquers the Siege Perilous, and where the knights see a vision of the Holy Grail and swear to find it. Jousts are often held in a meadow outside the city.

Its imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur&#x27;s court and universe. There is also a Kamaalot featured as the home of Percival&#x27;s mother in the romance &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;. In &quot;Palamedes&quot; and some other works, including the Post-Vulgate cycle, King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot is eventually razed to the ground by the treacherous King Mark of Cornwall (who had besieged it earlier) in his invasion of Logres after the Battle of Camlann. In the &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Camelot is abandoned and falls to ruin after the death of Arthur.

From Geoffrey&#x27;s grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants. Geoffrey&#x27;s description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur&#x27;s court. The tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, associated with the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; and perhaps first written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur&#x27;s hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in Celliwig, an uncertain locale in Cornwall.

Although the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the Welsh Triads agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the Celtic Britons: Cornwall, Wales and the Hen Ogledd. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by the 9th century which are recorded in various place names and features such as Arthur&#x27;s Seat, indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as Brittany. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location. Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and London perhaps being the most prominent.

In the 15th century, the English writer Thomas Malory created the image of Camelot most familiar today in his &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, a work based mostly on the French romances. He firmly identifies Camelot with Winchester in England, an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory&#x27;s own editor, William Caxton, who preferred a Welsh location. 

== Identifications ==
Arthurian scholar Norris J. Lacy commented that &quot;Camelot, located nowhere in particular, can be anywhere.&quot; The romancers&#x27; versions of Camelot draw on earlier traditions of Arthur&#x27;s fabulous court. The Celliwig of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; appears in the Welsh Triads as well; this early Welsh material places Wales&#x27; greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey&#x27;s description of Caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its Roman ruins; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (&quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, the Didot &quot;Perceval&quot; attributed to Robert de Boron, and even the early romances of Chrétien such as &quot;Erec and Enide&quot; and &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;) have Arthur hold court at &quot;Carduel in Wales&quot;, a northern city based on the real Carlisle. Malory&#x27;s identification of Camelot as Winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city&#x27;s history: it had been the capital of Wessex under Alfred the Great, and boasted the Winchester Round Table, an artefact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory&#x27;s time. Caxton rejected the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at Caerwent.

In 1542, John Leland reported that the locals around Cadbury Castle (formerly known as Camalet) in Somerset considered it to be the original Camelot. This theory, which was repeated by later antiquaries, is bolstered, or may have derived from, Cadbury&#x27;s proximity to the River Cam and the villages of Queen Camel and West Camel, and remained popular enough to help inspire a large-scale archaeological dig in the 20th century. These excavations, led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966 to 1970, were titled &quot;Cadbury-Camelot&quot; and won much media attention. The dig revealed that the site seems to have been occupied as early as the 4th millennium BC and to have been refortified and occupied by a major Brittonic ruler and his war band from . This early medieval settlement continued until around 580. The works were by far the largest known fortification of the period, double the size of comparative &quot;caers&quot; and with Mediterranean artefacts representing extensive trade and Saxon ones showing possible conquest. The use of the name Camelot and the support of Geoffrey Ashe helped ensure much publicity for the finds, but Alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed Arthurian connection to the site. Following the arguments of David Dumville, Alcock felt the site was too late and too uncertain to be a tenable Camelot. Modern archaeologists follow him in rejecting the name, calling it instead Cadbury Castle hill fort. Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.

The name of the Romano-British town of Camulodunum (modern Colchester) was derived from the Celtic god Camulus. However, it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by Saxons, so it is unlikely to have been the location of any &quot;true&quot; Camelot, as Arthur is traditionally dated to the late 5th and early 6th century. The town was definitely known as Colchester as early as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 917. Even Colchester Museum argues strongly regarding the historical Arthur: &quot;It would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the Colchester area, or to Essex more generally,&quot; pointing out that the connection between the name Camulodunum and Colchester was unknown until the 18th century. Arthurian scholar Peter Field has suggested that another Camulodunum, a former Roman fort, is a likely location of King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot and that &quot;Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire,&quot; is where Arthur would have held court. This is because of the name, and also regarding its strategic location: it is but a few miles from the extreme south-west of Hen Ogledd (also making close to North Wales), and would have been a flagship point in staving off attacks to the Celtic kingdoms from the Angles and others.

Other places in Britain with names related to &quot;Camel&quot; have also been suggested, such as Camelford in Cornwall, located down the River Camel from where Geoffrey places Camlann, the scene of Arthur&#x27;s final battle. The area&#x27;s connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. Further north, Camelon and its connections with Arthur&#x27;s O&#x27;on have been mentioned in relation to Camelot, but Camelon may be an antiquarian neologism coined after the 15th century, with its earlier name being &quot;Carmore&quot; or &quot;Carmure&quot;. Graham Phillips rejected the word &quot;Camelot&quot; entirely as just Chrétien&#x27;s invention and instead proposed the old Roman city of Viroconium (near Shrewsbury in modern England) as Arthur&#x27;s capital, citing archaeological evidence of a grand palace having been in use around 500 AD. Alistair Moffat identified Camelot with Roxburgh in Scotland.

== Modern culture ==
Camelot has become a permanent fixture in modern interpretations of the Arthurian legend. The symbolism of Camelot so impressed Alfred, Lord Tennyson that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the legend. Modern stories typically retain Camelot&#x27;s lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the Arthurian world, though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a High Middle Ages palace. Some writers of the &quot;realist&quot; strain of modern Arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible Camelot. Inspired by Alcock&#x27;s Cadbury-Camelot excavation, some authors such as Marion Zimmer Bradley and Mary Stewart place their Camelots in that place and describe it accordingly.

Camelot lends its name to the musical &quot;Camelot&quot;, which was adapted into a film of the same title, featuring the Castle of Coca, Segovia as Camelot. An Arthurian television series &quot;Camelot&quot; was also named after the castle, as were some other works including the video game &quot;Camelot&quot; and the comic book series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;. French television series &quot;Kaamelott&quot; presents a humorous alternative version of the Arthurian legend; Camelot Theme Park is a now-abandoned Arthurian theme park resort located in the English county of Lancashire. The Camelot Group was the first operator of the UK National Lottery with lottery machines named after characters, places, and objects in Arthurian legend.

In American contexts, Camelot era refers to the presidency of John F. Kennedy. In a 1963 &quot;Life&quot; interview, Jacqueline, his widow, referenced a line from the Lerner and Loewe musical to describe the Kennedy era White House: &quot;Don&#x27;t let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.&quot; She indicated that it was one of Kennedy&#x27;s favourite lyrics from the musical and added, &quot;there&#x27;ll be great Presidents again [...] but there&#x27;ll never be another Camelot again.&quot;

The cultural impact of Camelot in Anglo-American culture can be understood in the numerous applications in ‘high’ and ‘popular’ culture by artists, filmmakers, public relations specialists, tableware and game makers, youth groups, stamp designers. The 2024 exhibit, Visualizing Camelot, at the University of Rochester Libraries offered an impressive cross-section of these applications.

<text>In the history of Nicaragua, the Contras (Spanish: &quot;La contrarrevolución&quot;, the counter-revolution) were the right-wing militias who waged anti-communist guerilla warfare (1979–1990) against the Marxist governments of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Junta of National Reconstruction, which came to power after the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979.

Months after the political dynasty (1936–1979) of the Somoza family lost the Nicaraguan Revolution to the Sandinistas, the US government sponsored the remaining national-guard soldiers and Somocista politicians of the losing side as &quot;la Contra&quot;, the right-wing counter-revolution. The American military assistance and financial aid granted the Contras a measure of political credibility and military utility as anti-communist militias useful to U.S. foreign policy in Latin America. In 1986, consequent to complaints of the Contras&#x27; regular violation of the human rights of Nicaraguan civilians, the Boland Amendment (1982–1986) ended U.S. financing of the Contras; yet the Reagan government illegally continued financing the anti-communist secret war of the Contras against Sandinista Nicaragua, known in the US as the Iran–Contra affair. By 1987, the CIA had organized most of the Contra militias into the anti-communist Nicaraguan Resistance, within which the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) was the greatest militia.

For eleven years, the Contras&#x27; counter-revolutionary war against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua featured terrorism and human rights violations against the civilian population of Nicaragua. In defense of the Contras, the Reagan government said that the anti-communist strategy of the US in Latin America did not include attacks upon civilian populations. The CIA said that the Contras&#x27; terrorism against Nicaraguan civilians resulted from &quot;the poor discipline characteristic of irregular forces&quot;, and that terrorism was not official military doctrine of the Contras, and that the responsible Contra leader was put to death because of the excessive brutality of his Contra guerrillas against Nicaraguan civilians. The Global Terrorism Database reports that Contras carried out more than 1,300 terrorist attacks.

==History==

===Origins===
The Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:

* Ex-guardsmen of the Nicaraguan National Guard and other right-wing figures who had fought for Nicaragua&#x27;s ex-dictator Somoza—these later were especially found in the military wing of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). Remnants of the Guard later formed groups such as the Fifteenth of September Legion, the Anti-Sandinista Guerrilla Special Forces, and the National Army of Liberation. Initially however, these groups were small and conducted little active raiding into Nicaragua.
* Anti-Somozistas who had supported the revolution but felt betrayed by the Sandinista government – e.g. Édgar Chamorro, prominent member of the political directorate of the FDN, or José Francisco Cardenal, who had briefly served in the Council of State before leaving Nicaragua out of disagreement with the Sandinista government&#x27;s policies and founding the Nicaraguan Democratic Union (UDN), an opposition group of Nicaraguan exiles in Miami. Another example are the MILPAS (Milicias Populares Anti-Sandinistas), peasant militias led by disillusioned Sandinista veterans from the northern mountains. Founded by Pedro Joaquín González (known as &quot;Dimas&quot;), the Milpistas were also known as (green corn). Even after his death, other MILPAS bands sprouted during 1980–1981. The Milpistas were composed largely of (peasant) highlanders and rural workers.
*Nicaraguans who had avoided direct involvement in the revolution but opposed the Sandinistas.

===Main groups===
The CIA and Argentine intelligence, seeking to unify the anti-Sandinista cause before initiating large-scale aid, persuaded 15 September Legion, the UDN and several former smaller groups to merge in September 1981 as the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (&quot;Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense&quot;, FDN). Although the FDN had its roots in two groups made up of former National Guardsmen (of the Somoza regime), its joint political directorate was led by businessman and former anti-Somoza activist Adolfo Calero Portocarrero. Édgar Chamorro later stated that there was strong opposition within the UDN against working with the Guardsmen and that the merging only took place because of insistence by the CIA.

Based in Honduras, Nicaragua&#x27;s northern neighbor, under the command of former National Guard Colonel Enrique Bermúdez, the new FDN commenced to draw in other smaller insurgent forces in the north. Largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized by the U.S., it emerged as the largest and most active contra group.

In April 1982, Edén Pastora (&quot;Comandante Cero&quot;), one of the heroes in the fight against Somoza, organized the Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) – embedded in the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE) – and declared war on the Sandinista government. Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned abruptly in 1981 and defected, believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinistas&#x27; original ideas. A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly. He confined himself to operate in the southern part of Nicaragua; after a press conference he was holding on 30 May 1984 was bombed, he &quot;voluntarily withdrew&quot; from the contra struggle.

A third force, Misurasata, appeared among the Miskito, Sumo and Rama Amerindian peoples of Nicaragua&#x27;s Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the government&#x27;s efforts to nationalize Indian land. In the course of this conflict, forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians to relocation centers in the interior of the country and subsequent burning of some villages took place. The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of Stedman Fagoth Muller allying itself more closely with the FDN, and the rest accommodating themselves with the Sandinistas: on 8 December 1984 a ceasefire agreement known as the Bogota Accord was signed by Misurasata and the Nicaraguan government. A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance.

===Unity efforts===
U.S. officials were active in attempting to unite the Contra groups. In June 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO), under the leadership of Adolfo Calero, Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo, all originally supporters of the anti-Somoza revolution. After UNO&#x27;s dissolution early in 1987, the Nicaraguan Resistance (RN) was organized along similar lines in May.

==U.S. military and financial assistance==

In front of the International Court of Justice, the Nicaraguan government claimed that the Contras were altogether a creation of the U.S. This claim was rejected but the evidence of a very close relationship between the Contras and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible. The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the Contras over a long period, and it is unlikely that the Contras would have been capable of carrying out significant military operations without this support, given the large amount of training and weapons shipments that the Sandinistas had received from Cuba and the Soviet Union.

===Political background===

The US government viewed the leftist Sandinistas as a threat to economic interests of American corporations in Nicaragua and to national security. US President Ronald Reagan stated in 1983 that &quot;The defense of [the USA&#x27;s] southern frontier&quot; was at stake. &quot;In spite of the Sandinista victory being declared fair, the United States continued to oppose the left-wing Nicaraguan government.&quot; and opposed its ties to Cuba and the Soviet Union. Ronald Reagan, who had assumed the American presidency in January 1981, accused the Sandinistas of importing Cuban-style socialism and aiding leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. The Reagan administration continued to view the Sandinistas as undemocratic despite the 1984 Nicaraguan elections being generally declared fair by foreign observers. Throughout the 1980s the Sandinista government was regarded as &quot;Partly Free&quot; by Freedom House, an organization financed by the U.S. government. 

On 4 January 1982, Reagan signed the top secret National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17), giving the CIA the authority to recruit and support the Contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the Contras was one component of the Reagan Doctrine, which called for providing military support to movements opposing Soviet-supported, communist governments.

By December 1981, the United States had already begun to support armed opponents of the Sandinista government. From the beginning, the CIA was in charge. The arming, clothing, feeding and supervision of the Contras became the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the agency in nearly a decade.

In the fiscal year 1984, the U.S. Congress approved $24 million in aid to the Contras. After this, since the Contras failed to win widespread popular support or military victories within Nicaragua, opinion polls indicated that a majority of the U.S. public was not supportive of the Contras, the Reagan administration lost much of its support regarding its Contra policy within Congress after disclosure of CIA mining of Nicaraguan ports, and a report of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research commissioned by the State Department found Reagan&#x27;s allegations about Soviet influence in Nicaragua &quot;exaggerated&quot;, Congress cut off all funds for the contras in 1985 by the third Boland Amendment. The Boland Amendment had first been passed by Congress in December 1982. At this time, it only outlawed U.S. assistance to the contras &quot;for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan government&quot;, while allowing assistance for other purposes. In October 1984, it was amended to forbid action by not only the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency but all U.S. government agencies.

Nevertheless, the case for support of the Contras continued to be made in Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and the Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for the Contras would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.

On 1 May 1985 President Reagan announced that his administration perceived Nicaragua to be &quot;an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States&quot;, and declared a &quot;national emergency&quot; and a trade embargo against Nicaragua to &quot;deal with that threat&quot;. It &quot;is now a given; it is true&quot;, the Washington Post declared in 1986, &quot;the Sandinistas are communists of the Cuban or Soviet school&quot;; that &quot;The Reagan administration is right to take Nicaragua as a serious menace—to civil peace and democracy in Nicaragua and to the stability and security of the region&quot;; that we must &quot;fit Nicaragua back into a Central American mode&quot; and &quot;turn Nicaragua back toward democracy&quot;, and with the &quot;Latin American democracies&quot; &quot;demand reasonable conduct by regional standard.&quot;

Soon after the embargo was established, Managua re-declared &quot;a policy of nonalignment&quot; and sought the aid of Western Europe, who were opposed to U.S. policy, to escape dependency on the Soviet Union. Since 1981 U.S. pressures had curtailed Western credit to and trade with Nicaragua, forcing the government to rely almost totally on the Eastern bloc for credit, other aid, and trade by 1985. In his 1997 study on U.S. low intensity warfare, Kermit D. Johnson, a former Chief of the U.S. Army Chaplains, contends that U.S. hostility toward the revolutionary government was motivated not by any concern for &quot;national security&quot;, but rather by what the world relief organization Oxfam termed &quot;the threat of a good example&quot;:

It was alarming that in just a few months after the Sandinista revolution, Nicaragua received international acclaim for its rapid progress in the fields of literacy and health. It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do in a few short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government&#x27;s political and moral legitimacy.

The government&#x27;s program included increased wages, subsidized food prices, and expanded health, welfare, and education services. And though it nationalized Somoza&#x27;s former properties, it preserved a private sector that accounted for between 50 and 60 percent of GDP.

=== Atrocities ===
The United States began to support Contra activities against the Sandinista government by December 1981, with the CIA at the forefront of operations. The CIA supplied the funds and the equipment, coordinated training programs, and provided intelligence and target lists. While the Contras had little military successes, they did prove adept at carrying out CIA guerrilla warfare strategies from training manuals which advised them to incite mob violence, &quot;neutralize&quot; civilian leaders and government officials and attack &quot;soft targets&quot; — including schools, health clinics and cooperatives. The agency added to the Contras&#x27; sabotage efforts by blowing up refineries and pipelines, and mining ports. Finally, according to former Contra leader Edgar Chamorro, CIA trainers also gave Contra soldiers large knives. &quot;A commando knife [was given], and our people, everybody wanted to have a knife like that, to kill people, to cut their throats&quot;. In 1985 &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a series of photos taken by Frank Wohl, a conservative student admirer traveling with the Contras, entitled &quot;Execution in the Jungle&quot;:

The victim dug his own grave, scooping the dirt out with his hands ... He crossed himself. Then a contra executioner knelt and rammed a k-bar knife into his throat. A second enforcer stabbed at his jugular, then his abdomen. When the corpse was finally still, the contras threw dirt over the shallow grave — and walked away.

The CIA officer in charge of the covert war, Duane &quot;Dewey&quot; Clarridge, admitted to the House Intelligence Committee staff in a secret briefing in 1984 that the Contras were routinely murdering &quot;civilians and Sandinista officials in the provinces, as well as heads of cooperatives, nurses, doctors and judges&quot;. But he claimed that this did not violate President Reagan&#x27;s executive order prohibiting assassinations because the agency defined it as just &#x27;killing&#x27;. &quot;After all, this is war—a paramilitary operation&quot;, Clarridge said in conclusion. Edgar Chamorro explained the rationale behind this to a U.S. reporter. &quot;Sometimes terror is very productive. This is the policy, to keep putting pressure until the people cry &#x27;uncle&#x27;&quot;. The CIA manual for the Contras, &quot;Tayacan&quot;, states that the Contras should gather the local population for a public tribunal to &quot;shame, ridicule and humiliate&quot; Sandinista officials to &quot;reduce their influence&quot;. It also recommends gathering the local population to witness and take part in public executions. These types of activities continued throughout the war. After the signing of the Central American Peace Accord in August 1987, the year war related deaths and economic destruction reached its peak, the Contras eventually entered negotiations with the Sandinista government (1988), and the war began to deescalate.

By 1989 the U.S.-backed Contra war and economic isolation had inflicted severe economic suffering on Nicaraguans. The US government knew that the Nicaraguans had been exhausted from the war, which had cost 30,865 lives, and that voters usually vote the incumbents out during economic decline. By the late 1980s Nicaragua&#x27;s internal conditions had changed so radically that the US approach to the 1990 elections differed greatly from 1984. A united opposition of fourteen political parties organized into the National Opposition Union (Unión Nacional Oppositora, UNO) with the support of the United States National Endowment for Democracy. UNO presidential nominee Violeta Chamorro was received by President Bush at the White House.

The Contra war escalated over the year before the election. The US promised to end the economic embargo should Chamorro win.

The UNO scored a decisive victory on 25 February 1990. Chamorro won with 55 percent of the presidential vote as compared to Ortega&#x27;s 41 percent. Of 92 seats in the National Assembly, UNO gained 51, and the FSLN won 39. On 25 April 1990, Chamorro assumed presidency from Daniel Ortega.

===Illegal covert operations===

With Congress blocking further aid to the Contras, the Reagan administration sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of third countries and private sources. Between 1984 and 1986, $34 million from third countries and $2.7 million from private sources were raised this way. The secret contra assistance was run by the National Security Council, with officer Lt. Col. Oliver North in charge. With the third-party funds, North created an organization called &quot;The Enterprise&quot;, which served as the secret arm of the NSC staff and had its own airplanes, pilots, airfield, ship, operatives, and secret Swiss bank accounts. It also received assistance from personnel from other government agencies, especially from CIA personnel in Central America. This operation functioned, however, without any of the accountability required of U.S. government activities. The Enterprise&#x27;s efforts culminated in the Iran–Contra Affair of 1986–1987, which facilitated contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to Iran.

According to the London Spectator, U.S. journalists in Central America had long known that the CIA was flying in supplies to the Contras inside Nicaragua before the scandal broke. No journalist paid it any attention until the alleged CIA supply man, Eugene Hasenfus, was shot down and captured by the Nicaraguan army. Similarly, reporters neglected to investigate many leads indicating that Oliver North was running the Contra operation from his office in the National Security Council.

According to the National Security Archive, Oliver North had been in contact with Manuel Noriega, the military leader of Panama later convicted on drug charges, whom he personally met. The issue of drug money and its importance in funding the Nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications. The contras were funded by drug trafficking, of which the United States was aware. Senator John Kerry&#x27;s 1988 Committee on Foreign Relations report on Contra drug links concluded that &quot;senior U.S. policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras&#x27; funding problems&quot;.

The Reagan administration&#x27;s support for the Contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s. In August 1996, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; reporter Gary Webb published a series titled &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;, alleging that the contras contributed to the rise of crack cocaine in California.

Gary Webb&#x27;s career as a journalist was subsequently discredited by the leading U.S. papers, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Washington Post, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. An internal CIA report, entitled, &quot;Managing a Nightmare&quot;, shows the agency used &quot;a ground base of already productive relations with journalists&quot; to help counter what it called &quot;a genuine public relations crisis.&quot; In the 1980s, Douglas Farah worked as a journalist, covering the civil wars in Central America for the Washington Post. According to Farah, while it was common knowledge that the Contras were involved in cocaine trafficking, the editors of the Washington Post refused to take it seriously:

If you&#x27;re talking about our intelligence community tolerating — if not promoting — drugs to pay for black ops, it&#x27;s rather an uncomfortable thing to do when you&#x27;re an establishment paper like the Post. If you were going to be directly rubbing up against the government, they wanted it more solid than it could probably ever be done.

An investigation by the United States Department of Justice also stated that their &quot;review did not substantiate the main allegations stated and implied in the &quot;Mercury News&quot; articles.&quot; Regarding the specific charges towards the CIA, the DOJ wrote &quot;the implication that the drug trafficking by the individuals discussed in the &quot;Mercury News&quot; articles was connected to the CIA was also not supported by the facts.&quot; The CIA also investigated and rejected the allegations.

===Propaganda===
During the time the US Congress blocked funding for the contras, the Reagan government engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion and change the vote in Congress on contra aid. For this purpose, the NSC established an interagency working group, which in turn coordinated the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean (managed by Otto Reich), which conducted the campaign. The S/LPD produced and widely disseminated a variety of pro-contra publications, arranged speeches and press conferences. It also disseminated &quot;white propaganda&quot;—pro-contra newspaper articles by paid consultants who did not disclose their connection to the Reagan administration.

On top of that, Oliver North helped Carl Channell&#x27;s tax-exempt organization, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, to raise $10 million, by arranging numerous briefings for groups of potential contributors at the premises of the White House and by facilitating private visits and photo sessions with President Reagan for major contributors. Channell in turn, used part of that money to run a series of television advertisements directed at home districts of Congressmen considered swing votes on contra aid. Out of the $10 million raised, more than $1 million was spent on pro-contra publicity.

===International Court of Justice ruling===

In 1984 the Sandinista government filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the United States (&quot;Nicaragua v. United States&quot;), which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated international law by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua&#x27;s harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view that the United States could be held accountable for them only if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the contra operations resulting in these alleged violations. Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual &quot;Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare (Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas&quot;) and disseminating it to the contras. The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians and recommended to hire professional killers for specific selective tasks.

The United States, which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, maintained that the ICJ&#x27;s power did not supersede the Constitution of the United States and argued that the court did not seriously consider the Nicaraguan role in El Salvador, while it accused Nicaragua of actively supporting armed groups there, specifically in the form of supply of arms. The ICJ had found that evidence of a responsibility of the Nicaraguan government in this matter was insufficient. The U.S. argument was affirmed, however, by the dissenting opinion of ICJ member U.S. Judge Schwebel, who concluded that in supporting the contras, the United States acted lawfully in collective self-defence in El Salvador&#x27;s support. The U.S. blocked enforcement of the ICJ judgment by the United Nations Security Council and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any actual compensation. The Nicaraguan government finally withdrew the complaint from the court in September 1992 (under the later, post-FSLN, government of Violeta Chamorro), following a repeal of the law requiring the country to seek compensation.

==Human rights violations==
Americas Watch, which subsequently became part of Human Rights Watch, accused the Contras of:
*targeting health care clinics and health care workers for assassination
*kidnapping civilians
*torturing civilians
*executing civilians, including children, who were captured in combat
*raping women
*indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses
*seizing civilian property
*burning civilian houses in captured towns.

Human Rights Watch released a report on the situation in 1989, which stated: &quot;[The] contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners.&quot;

In his affidavit to the World Court, former contra Edgar Chamorro testified that &quot;The CIA did not discourage such tactics. To the contrary, the Agency severely criticized me when I admitted to the press that the FDN had regularly kidnapped and executed agrarian reform workers and civilians. We were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas was to ...kill, kidnap, rob and torture&quot;.

Contra leader Adolfo Calero denied that his forces deliberately targeted civilians: &quot;What they call a cooperative is also a troop concentration full of armed people. We are not killing civilians. We are fighting armed people and returning fire when fire is directed at us.&quot;

===Controversy===
Several articles were published by U.S. press, including by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, accusing Americas Watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting. The articles alleged that Americas Watch gave too much credence to alleged Contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit Nicaraguan human rights groups such as the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, which blamed the most human rights abuses on the Sandinistas.

In 1985, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported:
Human Rights Watch, the umbrella organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: &quot;Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements on human rights exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras ... The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, not only because the contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the Bush administration has continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously.&quot;

==Military successes and election of Violeta Chamorro==
By 1986 the contras were besieged by charges of corruption, human-rights abuses, and military ineptitude. A much-vaunted early 1986 offensive never materialized, and Contra forces were largely reduced to isolated acts of terrorism. In October 1987, however, the contras staged a successful attack in southern Nicaragua. Then on 21 December 1987, the FDN launched attacks at Bonanza, Siuna, and Rosita in Zelaya province, resulting in heavy fighting. ARDE Frente Sur attacked at El Almendro and along the Rama road. These large-scale raids mainly became possible as the contras were able to use U.S.-provided Redeye missiles against Sandinista Mi-24 helicopter gunships, which had been supplied by the Soviets. Nevertheless, the Contras remained tenuously encamped within Honduras and were not able to hold Nicaraguan territory.

There were isolated protests among the population against the draft implemented by the Sandinista government, which even resulted in full-blown street clashes in Masaya in 1988. However, a June 1988 survey in Managua showed the Sandinista government still enjoyed strong support but that support had declined since 1984. Three times as many people identified with the Sandinistas (28%) than with all the opposition parties put together (9%); 59% did not identify with any political party. Of those polled, 85% opposed any further US aid to the Contras; 40% believed the Sandinista government to be democratic, while 48% believed it to be not democratic. People identified the war as the largest problem but were less likely to blame it for economic problems compared to a December 1986 poll; 19% blamed the war and US blockade as the main cause of economic problems while 10% blamed the government. Political opposition groups were splintered and the Contras began to experience defections, although United States aid maintained them as a viable military force.

After a cutoff in U.S. military support, and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict, the contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. With the help of five Central American presidents, including Ortega, the sides agreed that a voluntary demobilization of the contras should start in early December 1989. They chose this date to facilitate free and fair elections in Nicaragua in February 1990 (even though the Reagan administration had pushed for a delay of contra disbandment).

In the resulting February 1990 elections, Violeta Chamorro and her party the UNO won an upset victory of 55% to 41% over Daniel Ortega. Opinion polls leading up to the elections divided along partisan lines, with 10 of 17 polls analyzed in a contemporary study predicting an UNO victory while seven predicted the Sandinistas would retain power.

Possible explanations include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won. Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras, with a Canadian observer mission claiming that 42 people were killed by the contras in &quot;election violence&quot; in October 1989. Sandinistas were also accused of intimidation and abuses during the election campaign. According to the Puebla Institute, by mid-December 1989, seven opposition leaders had been murdered, 12 had disappeared, 20 had been arrested, and 30 others assaulted. In late January 1990, the OAS observer team reported that &quot;a convoy of troops attacked four truckloads of UNO sympathizers with bayonets and rifle butts, threatening to kill them.&quot; This led many commentators to conclude that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the contra war and economic deprivation.

<text>John Craig Venter (born October 14, 1946) is an American scientist. He is known for leading one of the first draft sequences of the human genome and led the first team to transfect a cell with a synthetic chromosome. Venter founded Celera Genomics, the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). He was the co-founder of Human Longevity Inc. and Synthetic Genomics. He was listed on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2007 and 2008 &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world. In 2010, the British magazine &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed Craig Venter at 14th in the list of &quot;The World&#x27;s 50 Most Influential Figures 2010&quot;. In 2012, Venter was honored with Dan David Prize for his contribution to genome research. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2013. He is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

==Early life and education==
Venter was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of Elisabeth and John Venter. His family moved to Millbrae, California during his childhood. In his youth, he did not take his education seriously, preferring to spend his time on the water in boats or surfing. According to his biography, &quot;A Life Decoded&quot;, he was said never to be a terribly engaged student, having Cs and Ds on his eighth-grade report cards. Venter considered that his behavior in his adolescence was indicative of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and later found ADHD-linked genetic variants in his own DNA. He graduated from Mills High School. His father died suddenly at age 59 from cardiac arrest, giving him a lifelong awareness of his own mortality. He quotes a saying: &quot;If you want immortality, do something meaningful with your life.&quot;

Although he opposed the Vietnam War, Venter was drafted and enlisted in the United States Navy where he worked as a hospital corpsman in the intensive-care ward of a field hospital. He served from 1967 to 1968 at the Naval Support Activity Danang in Vietnam. While in Vietnam, he attempted suicide by swimming out to sea, but changed his mind more than a mile out.
Being confronted with severely injured and dying marines on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine, although he later switched to biomedical research.

Venter began his college education in 1969 at a community college, College of San Mateo in California, and later transferred to the University of California, San Diego, where he studied under biochemist Nathan O. Kaplan. He received a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry in 1972 and a Doctor of Philosophy in physiology and pharmacology in 1975 from UCSD.

==Career==
After working as an associate professor, and later as full professor, at the State University of New York at Buffalo, he joined the National Institutes of Health in 1984.

===EST controversy===
While an employee of the NIH, Venter learned how to identify mRNA and began to learn more about those expressed in the human brain. The short cDNA sequence fragments Venter discovered by automated DNA sequencing, he named expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. The NIH Office of Technology Transfer decided to file a patent on the ESTs discovered by Venter, patenting the genes identified based on studies of mRNA expression in the human brain. When Venter disclosed the NIH strategy during a Congressional hearing, a firestorm of controversy erupted. The NIH later stopped the effort and abandoned the patent applications it had filed, following public outcry.

===Human Genome Project===

Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to transform healthcare radically. Venter believed that shotgun sequencing was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data. The method was rejected by the Human Genome Project however, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans, that it would be logistically more difficult, and that it would cost significantly more.

Venter viewed the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome project as an opportunity to continue his interest in trying his shotgun sequencing method to speed up the human genome sequencing so when he was offered funding from a DNA sequencing company to start Celera Genomics. The company planned to profit from their work by creating genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. Venter&#x27;s effort won him renown as he and his team at Celera Corporation shared credit for sequencing the first draft human genome with the publicly funded Human Genome Project.

In 2000, Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Venter and Collins thus shared an award for &quot;Biography of the Year&quot; from A&amp;E Network.
On February 15, 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, followed one day later by a Celera publication in &quot;Science&quot;. Despite some claims that shotgun sequencing was in some ways less accurate than the clone-by-clone method chosen by the Human Genome Project, the technique became widely accepted by the scientific community.

Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002. According to his biography, Venter was fired because of a conflict with the main investor, Tony White, specifically barring him from attending the White House ceremony celebrating the achievement of sequencing the human genome.

===Global Ocean Sampling Expedition===
The Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS) is an ocean exploration genome project with the goal of assessing the genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and to understand their role in nature&#x27;s fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, the full Expedition was announced by Venter on March 4, 2004. The project, which used Venter&#x27;s personal yacht, &quot;Sorcerer II&quot;, started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.

===Synthetic Genomics===

In June 2005, Venter co-founded Synthetic Genomics, a firm dedicated to using modified microorganisms to produce clean fuels and biochemicals. In July 2009, ExxonMobil announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation biofuels. 
Venter continues to work on the creation of engineered diatomic microalgae for the production of biofuels.

Venter is seeking to patent the first partially synthetic species possibly to be named &quot;Mycoplasma laboratorium&quot;. There is speculation that this line of research could lead to producing bacteria that have been engineered to perform specific reactions, for example, produce fuels, make medicines, combat global warming, and so on.

In May 2010, a team of scientists led by Venter became the first to create successfully what was described as &quot;synthetic life&quot;. This was done by synthesizing a very long DNA molecule containing an entire bacterium genome, and introducing this into another cell, analogous to the accomplishment of Eckard Wimmer&#x27;s group, who synthesized and ligated an RNA virus genome and &quot;booted&quot; it in cell lysate. The single-celled organism contains four &quot;watermarks&quot;
written into its DNA to identify it as synthetic and to help trace its descendants. The watermarks include 
# Code table for entire alphabet with punctuations
# Names of 46 contributing scientists
# Three quotations
# The secret email address for the cell.

On March 25, 2016, Venter reported the creation of Syn 3.0, a synthetic genome having the fewest genes of any freely living organism (473 genes). Their aim was to strip away all nonessential genes, leaving only the minimal set necessary to support life.
This stripped-down, fast reproducing cell is expected to be a valuable tool for researchers in the field.

In August 2018, Venter retired as chairman of the board, saying he wanted to focus on his work at the J. Craig Venter Institute. He will remain as a scientific advisor to the board.

===J. Craig Venter Institute===
In 2006 Venter founded the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), a nonprofit which conducts research in synthetic biology. It has facilities in La Jolla and in Rockville, Maryland and employs over 200 people.

In April 2022 Venter sold the La Jolla JCVI facility to the University of California, San Diego for $25 million. Venter will continue to lead a separate nonprofit research group, also known as the J. Craig Venter Institute, and stressed that he is not retiring. The Venter Institute has out grown its current building with multiple new facility hires and will be moving into new space in 2025.

===Individual human genome===
On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published one of the first genomes of an individual human—Venter&#x27;s own DNA sequence. Some of the sequences in Venter&#x27;s genome are associated with wet earwax, increased risk of antisocial behavior, Alzheimer&#x27;s and cardiovascular diseases. 

The Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter&#x27;s recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using microfluidic Sanger sequencing, assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million DNA variations identified by genome analysis. These variants include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), block substitutions, short and large indels, and structural variations like insertions, deletions, inversions and copy number changes.

The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the NCBI and Ensembl annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the haplotype blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including dbSNP, Ensembl, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Gene Ontology (GO).

Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef contig or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

===Human Longevity, Inc.===
On March 4, 2014, Venter and co-founders Peter Diamandis and Robert Hariri announced the formation of Human Longevity, Inc., a company focused on extending the healthy, &quot;high performance&quot; human lifespan. At the time of the announcement the company had already raised $70 million in venture financing, which was expected to last 18 months. Venter served as the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) until May 2018, when he retired. The company said that it plans to sequence 40,000 genomes per year, with an initial focus on cancer genomes and the genomes of cancer patients.

Human Longevity filed a lawsuit in 2018 against Venter, accusing him of stealing trade secrets. Allegations were made stating that Venter had departed with his company computer that contained valuable information that could be used to start a competing business. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a California judge on the basis that Human Longevity were unable to present a case that met the legal threshold required for a company, or individual, to sue when its trade secrets have been stolen.

Human Longevity&#x27;s mission is to extend healthy human lifespan by the use of high-resolution big data diagnostics from genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, and proteomics, and the use of stem cell therapy.

==Published books==
Venter is the author of three books, the first of which is an autobiography titled &quot;A Life Decoded&quot;. In Venter&#x27;s second book, &quot;Life at the Speed of Light&quot;, he announced his theory that this is the generation in which there appears to be a dovetailing of the two previously diverse fields of science represented by computer programming and the genetic programming of life by DNA sequencing. He was applauded for his position on this by futurist Ray Kurzweil. Venter&#x27;s most recent book, co-authored by David Ewing Duncan, &quot;The Voyage of Sorcerer II: The Expedition that Unlocked the Secrets of the Ocean’s Microbiome&quot;, details the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, spanning a 15-year period during which microbes from the world&#x27;s oceans were collected and their DNA sequenced.

==Personal life==
After a 12-year marriage to Barbara Rae-Venter, with whom he had a son, Christopher, he married Claire M. Fraser remaining married to her until 2005. In late 2008 he married Heather Kowalski. They live in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, CA. Venter is an atheist.

Venter was 75 when he sold his main research building to UCSD in 2022. The institute had out grown the space and will be moving to a new facility in 2025. The Venter Institute campus in Rockville MD also continues to expand. He said he has no intention of retiring. He has a home in La Jolla and a ranch in Borrego Springs, California, as well as homes in two small towns in Maine. He indulges in two passions: sailing and flying a Cirrus 22T plane, which he calls &quot;the ultimate freedom&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Venter has been the subject of articles in several magazines, including &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, Australian science magazine &quot;Cosmos&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

Venter appears in the two-hour 2001 &quot;NOVA&quot; special, &quot;Cracking the code of life&quot;.

On May 16, 2004, Venter gave the commencement speech at Boston University.

On December 4, 2007, Venter gave the Dimbleby lecture for the BBC in London.

Venter gave the Distinguished Public Lecture during the 2007 Michaelmas Term at the James Martin 21st Century School at Oxford University. Its title was &quot;Genomics – From humans to the environment&quot;.

Venter delivered the 2008 convocation speech for Faculty of Science honours and specialization students at the University of Alberta.

In February 2008, he gave a speech about his current work at the TED conference.

Venter was featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Top 10 Everything of 2008&quot; article. Number three in 2008&#x27;s Top 10 Scientific Discoveries was a piece outlining his work stitching together the 582,000 base pairs necessary to invent the genetic information for a whole new bacterium.

On May 20, 2010, Venter announced the creation of first self-replicating semi-synthetic bacterial cell.

In the June 2011 issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Venter was featured as the &quot;Survival Skills&quot; celebrity of the month. He shared various anecdotes and advice, including stories of his time in Vietnam, as well as mentioning a bout with melanoma on his back, which subsequently resulted in his &quot;giving a pound of flesh&quot; to surgery.

In May 2011, Venter was the commencement speaker at the 157th commencement of Syracuse University.

In May 2017, Venter was the guest of honor and keynote speaker at the inauguration ceremony of the Center for Systems Biology Dresden.

<text>Carl Ransom Rogers (January 8, 1902 – February 4, 1987) was an American psychologist who was one of the founders of humanistic psychology and was known especially for his person-centered psychotherapy. Rogers is widely considered one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1956.

The person-centered approach, Rogers&#x27;s approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains, such as psychotherapy and counseling (client-centered therapy), education (student-centered learning), organizations, and other group settings. For his professional work he received the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology from the APA in 1972. In a study by Steven J. Haggbloom and colleagues using six criteria such as citations and recognition, Rogers was found to be the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century and second, among clinical psychologists, only to Sigmund Freud. Based on a 1982 survey of 422 respondents of U.S. and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the most influential psychotherapist in history (Freud ranked third).

== Biography ==
Rogers was born on January 8, 1902, in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His father, Walter A. Rogers, was a civil engineer and a Congregationalist by religious denomination. His mother, Julia M. Cushing, was a homemaker and devout Baptist. Carl was the fourth of their six children.

Rogers was intelligent and could read well before kindergarten. After being raised in a strict religious environment as an altar boy at the vicarage of Jimpley, he became isolated, independent, and disciplined, gaining knowledge and an appreciation for the scientific method in a practical world. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he joined the fraternity Alpha Kappa Lambda and initially planned to study agriculture before switching to history and finally settling on religion.

At age 20, following his 1922 trip to Beijing, China, for an international Christian conference, Rogers started to doubt his religious convictions. To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled &quot;Why Am I Entering the Ministry?&quot; after which he decided to change careers. In 1924, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin, married fellow Wisconsin student and Oak Park resident Helen Elliott, and enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Sometime later, he reportedly became an atheist. Although referred to as an atheist early in his career, Rogers was eventually described as an agnostic. He reportedly spoke about spirituality quite often in his later years. Brian Thorne, who knew and collaborated with Rogers throughout the latter&#x27;s final decade of life, writes: &quot;In his later years his openness to experience compelled him to acknowledge the existence of a dimension to which he attached such adjectives as mystical, spiritual, and transcendental&quot;. Rogers concluded that there is a realm &quot;beyond&quot; scientific psychology—a realm he came to prize as &quot;the indescribable, the spiritual.&quot;

After two years at Union, Rogers left to attend Teachers College, Columbia University, obtaining an M.A. in 1927 and a Ph.D. in 1931. While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in scientific studies of children. As an intern in 1927–1928 at the now-defunct Institute for Child Guidance in New York, Rogers studied with psychologist Alfred Adler. Later in life, Rogers recalled: In 1930, Rogers served as director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940, he lectured at the University of Rochester and wrote &quot;The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child&quot; (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children. He was strongly influenced in constructing his client-centered approach by the post-Freudian psychotherapeutic practice of Otto Rank, especially as embodied in the work of Rank&#x27;s disciple: noted clinician and social work educator Jessie Taft. In 1940, Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University, where he wrote his second book, &quot;Counseling and Psychotherapy&quot; (1942). In it, Rogers suggests that by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, a client can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life.

In 1945, Rogers was invited to set up a counseling center at the University of Chicago. While a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago (1945–1957), Rogers helped establish a counseling center connected with the university and conducted studies to determine his methods&#x27; effectiveness. His findings and theories appeared in &quot;Client-Centered Therapy&quot; (1951) and &quot;Psychotherapy and Personality Change&quot; (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, Thomas Gordon, established the Parent Effectiveness Training movement. Another student, Eugene T. Gendlin, who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the psychotherapeutic method of focusing based on Rogerian listening.

In 1947, he was elected president of the American Psychological Association. In 1956, Rogers became the first president of the American Academy of Psychotherapists. He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957–1963). During this time, he wrote one of his best-known books, &quot;On Becoming a Person&quot; (1961). A student of his there, Marshall Rosenberg, went on to develop Nonviolent Communication. Rogers and Abraham Maslow pioneered a movement called humanistic psychology, which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Rogers was also one of the people who questioned the rise of McCarthyism in the 1950s. In articles, he criticized society for its backward-looking affinities.

Rogers continued teaching at the University of Wisconsin until 1963 when he became a resident at the new Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (WBSI) in La Jolla, California. Rogers left the WBSI to help found the Center for Studies of the Person in 1968. His later books include &quot;Carl Rogers on Personal Power&quot; (1977) and &quot;Freedom to Learn for the &#x27;80s&quot; (1983). He remained a La Jolla resident for the rest of his life, doing therapy, giving speeches, and writing.

In his later years, Rogers focused on applying his theories to address political oppression and social conflict globally. He facilitated dialogue between Protestants and Catholics in Belfast, Blacks and Whites in South Africa, and people transitioning to democracy in Brazil. In the U.S., he worked with health consumers and providers. At 85, his final trip was to the Soviet Union, where he conducted workshops that promoted communication and creativity, impressed by the awareness of his work among Russians.

Between 1974 and 1984, Rogers, his daughter Natalie Rogers, and psychologists Maria Bowen, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and John K. Wood convened a series of residential programs in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, and Japan: the Person-Centered Approach Workshops. The workshops focused on cross-cultural communications, personal growth, self-empowerment, and learning for social change.

In 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured pelvis; he had life alert and was able to contact paramedics. He had a successful operation, but his pancreas failed the next night, and he died a few days later after a heart attack.

One of Rogers&#x27;s most famous quotations is: &quot;Death is final, and accepting that is the most difficult thing to undertake. That loved one is not coming back and nothing can change that. Nothing compares to them. Life is precious and vulnerable, so be wise with how you choose to spend it, because once death arrives there is no turning back.&quot;

== Theory ==
Rogers&#x27;s theory of the self is considered humanistic, existential, and phenomenological. It is based directly on the &quot;phenomenal field&quot; personality theory of Combs and Snygg (1949). Rogers&#x27;s elaboration of his theory is extensive. He wrote 16 books and many more journal articles about it. Prochaska and Norcross (2003) states Rogers &quot;consistently stood for an empirical evaluation of psychotherapy. He and his followers have demonstrated a humanistic approach to conducting therapy and a scientific approach to evaluating therapy need not be incompatible.&quot;

=== Nineteen propositions ===
Rogers&#x27;s theory (as of 1951) was based on 19 propositions:
# All individuals (organisms) exist in a continually changing world of experience (phenomenal field) of which they are the center.
# The organism reacts to the field as it is experienced and perceived. This perceptual field is &quot;reality&quot; for the individual.
# The organism reacts as an organized whole to this phenomenal field.
# A portion of the total perceptual field gradually becomes differentiated as the self.
# As a result of interaction with the environment, and particularly as a result of evaluative interaction with others, the structure of the self is formed—an organized, fluid but consistent conceptual pattern of perceptions of characteristics and relationships of the &quot;I&quot; or the &quot;me&quot;, together with values attached to these concepts.
# The organism has one basic tendency and striving—to actualize, maintain and enhance the experiencing organism.
# The best vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frame of reference of the individual.
# Behavior is basically the goal-directed attempt of the organism to satisfy its needs as experienced, in the field as perceived.
# Emotion accompanies, and in general facilitates, such goal directed behavior, the kind of emotion being related to the perceived significance of the behavior for the maintenance and enhancement of the organism.
# The values attached to experiences, and the values that are a part of the self-structure, in some instances, are values experienced directly by the organism, and in some instances are values introjected or taken over from others, but perceived in distorted fashion, as if they had been experienced directly.
# As experiences occur in the life of the individual, they are either (a) symbolized, perceived and organized into some relation to the self, (b) ignored because there is no perceived relationship to the self structure, or (c) denied symbolization or given distorted symbolization because the experience is inconsistent with the structure of the self.
# Most of the ways of behaving that the organism adopts are those that are consistent with the concept of self.
# In some instances, behavior may be brought about by organic experiences and needs that have not been symbolized. Such behavior may be inconsistent with the structure of the self, but in such instances the individual does not &quot;own&quot; the behavior.
# Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent relationship with the concept of self.
# Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of the self structure. When this situation exists, there is a basic or potential psychological tension.
# Any experience that is inconsistent with the organization of the structure of the self may be perceived as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.
# Under certain conditions, involving primarily complete absence of threat to the self structure, experiences inconsistent with it may be perceived and examined, and the structure of self revised to assimilate and include such experiences.
# When the individual perceives and accepts into one consistent and integrated system all his sensory and visceral experiences, he is necessarily more understanding of others and more accepting of others as separate individuals.
# As the individual perceives and accepts into his self structure more of his organic experiences, he finds that he is replacing his present value system—based extensively on introjections which have been distortedly symbolized—with a continuing organismic valuing process.

In relation to No. 17, Rogers is known for practicing &quot;unconditional positive regard&quot;, which is defined as accepting a person &quot;without negative judgment of ... [a person&#x27;s] basic worth&quot;.

=== Development of the personality ===
With regard to development, Rogers described principles rather than stages. The main issue is the development of a self-concept and the progress from an undifferentiated self to being fully differentiated.

In the development of the self-concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key. Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves. Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as &quot;conditions of worth&quot;) that others have laid down for them.

=== Fully functioning person ===
Optimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state. Rogers calls this &quot;the good life&quot;, where the organism continually aims to fulfill its potential. He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):
# A growing openness to experience: they move away from defensiveness and have no need for subception (a perceptual defense that involves unconsciously applying strategies to prevent a troubling stimulus from entering consciousness).
# An increasingly existential lifestyle: living each moment fully, not distorting the moment to fit personality or self-concept but allowing personality and self-concept to emanate from the experience. This results in excitement, daring, adaptability, tolerance, spontaneity, and lack of rigidity, and suggests a foundation of trust. &quot;To open one&#x27;s spirit to what is going on now, and discover in that present process whatever structure it appears to have&quot; (Rogers 1961).
# Increasing organismic trust: they trust their own judgment and ability to choose behavior appropriate for each moment. They do not rely on existing codes and social norms but trust that as they are open to experiences they will be able to trust their own sense of right and wrong.
# Freedom of choice: not being shackled by the restrictions that influence an incongruent individual, they are able to make a wider range of choices more fluently. They believe they play a role in determining their own behavior and so feel responsible for it.
# Creativity: it follows that they will feel freer to be creative. They will also be more creative in the way they adapt to their circumstances without feeling a need to conform.
# Reliability and constructiveness: they can be trusted to act constructively. An individual who is open to all their needs will be able to maintain a balance between them. Even aggressive needs will be matched and balanced by intrinsic goodness in congruent individuals.
# A rich full life: Rogers describes the life of the fully functioning individual as rich, full and exciting, and suggests that they experience joy and pain, love and heartbreak, fear and courage more intensely. His description of &quot;the good life&quot;:

=== Incongruity ===
Rogers identified the &quot;real self&quot; as the aspect of a person that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic values and needs, and receives positive regard from others and self. On the other hand, to the extent that society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency and people are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, receiving only conditional positive regard and self-regard, Rogers said that people develop instead an &quot;ideal self&quot;. By &quot;ideal&quot;, he was suggesting something not real, something always out of reach, a standard people cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the &quot;I am&quot; and the &quot;I should&quot;, Rogers called &quot;incongruity&quot;.

=== Psychopathology ===
Rogers described the concepts of &quot;congruence&quot; and &quot;incongruence&quot; as important in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for &quot;positive regard&quot;. In a fully congruent person, realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead authentic and genuine lives. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falsity and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with others&#x27; approval. They live lives that are not true to themselves.

Rogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining and protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic, this is difficult, and they are under constant threat. They deploy &quot;defense mechanisms&quot; to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: &quot;distortion&quot; and &quot;denial&quot;. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept. This defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self-structure. If the incongruity is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic. Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruity of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.

== Applications ==
=== Person-centered therapy ===

Rogers originally developed his theory as the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called it &quot;non-directive therapy&quot; but later replaced the term &quot;non-directive&quot; with &quot;client-centered&quot;, and still later &quot;person-centered&quot;. Even before the publication of &quot;Client-Centered Therapy&quot; in 1951, Rogers believed the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts, not just in therapy. As a result, he started to use the term &quot;person-centered approach&quot; to describe his overall theory. Person-centered therapy is the application of the person-centered approach to therapy. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, cross-cultural relations and other &quot;helping&quot; professions and situations. In 1946 Rogers co-authored &quot;Counseling with Returned Servicemen&quot; with John L. Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as &quot;The Interpersonal Gap&quot;), documenting the application of person-centered approach to counseling military personnel returning from World War II.

The first empirical evidence of the client-centered approach&#x27;s effectiveness was published in 1941 at the Ohio State University by Elias Porter, using the recordings of therapeutic sessions between Rogers and his clients. Porter used Rogers&#x27;s transcripts to devise a system to measure the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness a counselor employed. The counselor&#x27;s attitude and orientation were shown to be instrumental in the decisions the client made.

=== Learner-centered teaching ===
The application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy, with studies having begun in the late 1930s and continuing today (Cornelius-White, 2007). Rogers described the approach to education in &quot;Client-Centered Therapy&quot; and wrote &quot;Freedom to Learn&quot; devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969. &quot;Freedom to Learn&quot; was revised twice. The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education.
Before Rogers&#x27;s death, he and Harold Lyon began a book, &quot;On Becoming an Effective Teacher—Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon&quot;, that Lyon and Reinhard Tausch completed and published in 2013. It contains Rogers&#x27;s last unpublished writings on person-centered teaching. Rogers had the following five hypotheses regarding learner-centered education:
# &quot;A person cannot teach another person directly; a person can only facilitate another&#x27;s learning&quot; (Rogers, 1951). This is a result of his personality theory, which states that everyone exists in a constantly changing world of experience in which they are the center. Each person reacts and responds based on perception and experience. The belief is that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. The focus is on the student (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, the background and experiences of the learner are essential to how and what is learned. Each student will process what they learn differently depending on what they bring to the classroom.
# &quot;A person learns significantly only those things that are perceived as being involved in the maintenance of or enhancement of the structure of self&quot; (Rogers, 1951). Therefore, relevancy to the student is essential for learning. The students&#x27; experiences become the core of the course.
# &quot;Experience which, if assimilated, would involve a change in the organization of self, tends to be resisted through denial or distortion of symbolism&quot; (Rogers, 1951). If the content or presentation of a course is inconsistent with preconceived information, the student will learn if they are open to varying concepts. Being open to concepts that vary from one&#x27;s own is vital to learning. Therefore, gently encouraging open-mindedness is helpful in engaging the student in learning. Also, it is important, for this reason, that new information be relevant and related to existing experience.
# &quot;The structure and organization of self appears to become more rigid under threats and to relax its boundaries when completely free from threat&quot; (Rogers, 1951). If students believe that concepts are being forced upon them, they might become uncomfortable and fearful. A barrier is created by a tone of threat in the classroom. Therefore, an open, friendly environment in which trust is developed is essential in the classroom. Fear of retribution for not agreeing with a concept should be eliminated. A supportive classroom tone helps to alleviate fears and encourages students to have the courage to explore concepts and beliefs that vary from those they bring to the classroom. Also, new information might threaten the student&#x27;s concept of themself; therefore, the less vulnerable the student feels, the more likely they will be able to open up to the learning process.
# &quot;The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (a) threat to the self of the learner is reduced to a minimum and (b) differentiated perception of the field is facilitated&quot; (Rogers, 1951). The instructor should be open to learning from the students and working to connect the students to the subject matter. Frequent interaction with the students will help achieve this goal. The instructor&#x27;s acceptance of being a mentor who guides rather than the expert who tells is instrumental to student-centered, nonthreatening, and unforced learning.

=== Rogerian rhetorical approach ===

In 1970, Richard Young, Alton L. Becker, and Kenneth Pike published &quot;Rhetoric: Discovery and Change&quot;, a widely influential college writing textbook that used a Rogerian approach to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric. The Rogerian method of argument involves each side restating the other&#x27;s position to the satisfaction of the other, among other principles. In a paper, it can be expressed by carefully acknowledging and understanding the opposition, rather than dismissing them.

=== Cross-cultural relations ===
The application to cross-cultural relations has involved workshops in highly stressful situations and global locations, including conflicts and challenges in South Africa, Central America, and Ireland. Rogers, Alberto Zucconi, and Charles Devonshire co-founded the Istituto dell&#x27;Approccio Centrato sulla Persona (Person-Centered Approach Institute) in Rome, Italy.

Rogers&#x27;s international work for peace culminated in the Rust Peace Workshop, which took place in November 1985 in Rust, Austria. Leaders from 17 nations convened to discuss the topic &quot;The Central America Challenge&quot;. The meeting was notable for several reasons: it brought national figures together as people (not as their positions), it was a private event, and was an overwhelming positive experience where members heard one another and established real personal ties, as opposed to stiffly formal and regulated diplomatic meetings.

=== Person-centered, dialogic politics ===
Some scholars believe there is a politics implicit in Rogers&#x27;s approach to psychotherapy. Toward the end of his life, Rogers came to that view himself. The central tenet of Rogerian, person-centered politics is that public life need not consist of an endless series of winner-take-all battles among sworn opponents; rather, it can and should consist of an ongoing dialogue among all parties. Such dialogue is characterized by respect among the parties, authentic speaking by each, and—ultimately—empathic understanding among all parties. Out of such understanding, mutually acceptable solutions will (or at least can) flow.

During his last decade, Rogers facilitated or participated in a wide variety of dialogic activities among politicians, activists, and other social leaders, often outside the U.S. He also lent his support to several non-traditional U.S. political initiatives, including the &quot;12-Hour Political Party&quot; of the Association for Humanistic Psychology and the founding of a &quot;transformational&quot; political organization, the New World Alliance. By the 21st century, interest in dialogic approaches to political engagement and change had become widespread, especially among academics and activists. Theorists of a specifically Rogerian, person-centered approach to politics as dialogue have made substantial contributions to that project.

== Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) ==

From the late 1950s into the &#x27;60s, Rogers served on the board of the Human Ecology Fund, a CIA-funded organization that provided grants to researchers looking into personality. In addition, he and other people in the field of personality and psychotherapy were given a lot of information about Khrushchev. &quot;We were asked to figure out what we thought of him and what would be the best way of dealing with him. And that seemed to be an entirely principled and legitimate aspect. I don&#x27;t think we contributed very much, but, anyway, we tried.&quot;

<doc id="7555" wikidata="Q275393" url="?curid=7555" title="Casimir effect">
<text>In quantum field theory, the Casimir effect (or Casimir force) is a physical force acting on the macroscopic boundaries of a confined space which arises from the quantum fluctuations of a field. The term Casimir pressure is sometimes used when it is described in units of force per unit area. It is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir, who predicted the effect for electromagnetic systems in 1948.
In the same year Casimir, together with Dirk Polder, described a similar effect experienced by a neutral atom in the vicinity of a macroscopic interface which is called the Casimir–Polder force. Their result is a generalization of the London–van der Waals force and includes retardation due to the finite speed of light. The fundamental principles leading to the London–van der Waals force, the Casimir force, and the Casimir–Polder force can be formulated on the same footing.

In 1997 a direct experiment by Steven K. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the Casimir force to be within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.

The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of macroscopic material interfaces, such as electrical conductors and dielectrics, alter the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second-quantized electromagnetic field. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the materials, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.

Any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the Casimir effect. For example, beads on a string as well as plates submerged in turbulent water or gas illustrate the Casimir force.

In modern theoretical physics, the Casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon; in applied physics it is significant in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies.

== Physical properties ==
The typical example is of two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum, placed a few nanometers apart. In a classical description, the lack of an external field means that no field exists between the plates, and no force connects them. When this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons that constitute the field, and generate a net force – either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the plates&#x27; specific arrangement. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by second quantization.

The treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations is controversial. In fact, &quot;Casimir&#x27;s original goal was to compute the van der Waals force between polarizable molecules&quot; of the conductive plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) of quantum fields.

Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is small. This force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors at submicron scales. In fact, at separations of 10 nm – about 100 times the typical size of an atom – the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1 atmosphere of pressure (the precise value depends on surface geometry and other factors).

== History ==
Dutch physicists Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947; this special form is called the Casimir–Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948. This latter phenomenon is called the Casimir effect.

Predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, while later calculations considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy was made by measuring the thickness of liquid helium films. Finally, in 1997 Lamoreaux&#x27;s direct experiment quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory. Subsequent experiments approached an accuracy of a few percent.

== Possible causes ==
===Vacuum energy===
The causes of the Casimir effect are described by quantum field theory, which states that all of the various fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a &quot;field&quot; in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, and its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics. However, even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: spin, polarization in the case of light, energy, and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, &quot;empty&quot; in this sense. One important exception is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or zero-point energy that such an oscillator may have is

formula_1

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only &quot;differences&quot; in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains beyond the scope of quantum field theory), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists before the development in the 1970s of the renormalization group, a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.

When the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should instead actually result in the value of the cosmological constant that we observe.

The Casimir effect for fermions can be understood as the spectral asymmetry of the fermion operator, where it is known as the Witten index.

=== Relativistic van der Waals force ===
Alternatively, a 2005 paper by Robert Jaffe of MIT states that &quot;Casimir effects can be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies. They are relativistic, quantum forces between charges and currents. The Casimir force (per unit area) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha, the fine structure constant, goes to zero, and the standard result, which appears to be independent of alpha, corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit&quot;, and that &quot;The Casimir force is simply the (relativistic, retarded) van der Waals force between the metal plates.&quot; Casimir and Polder&#x27;s original paper used this method to derive the Casimir–Polder force. In 1978, Schwinger, DeRadd, and Milton published a similar derivation for the Casimir effect between two parallel plates. More recently, Nikolic proved from first principles of quantum electrodynamics that the Casimir force does not originate from the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field, and explained in simple terms why the fundamental microscopic origin of Casimir force lies in van der Waals forces.

== Effects ==
Casimir&#x27;s observation was that the second-quantized quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or dielectrics, must obey the same boundary conditions that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a conductor or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a radar cavity or a microwave waveguide. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the standing waves of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the th standing wave is . The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

formula_2

with the sum running over all possible values of enumerating the standing waves. The factor of is present because the zero-point energy of the th mode is , where is the energy increment for the th mode. (It is the same as appears in the equation .) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.

In particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape of the cavity. Each energy level depends on the shape, and so one should write for the energy level, and for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: The force at point on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by , at . That is, one has

formula_3

This value is finite in many practical calculations.

Attraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance from one of two widely separated plates (distance apart). With , the states within the slot of width are highly constrained so that the energy of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region where there is a large number of states (about ) with energy evenly spaced between and the next mode in the narrow slot, or in other words, all slightly larger than . Now on shortening by an amount (which is negative), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to , whereas all the states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to (note the different denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make slightly smaller, the plates drawing each other closer, across the thin slot.

== Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization ==
In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the -plane, the standing waves are

formula_4

where stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, and are the wavenumbers in directions parallel to the plates, and

formula_5

is the wavenumber perpendicular to the plates. Here, is an integer, resulting from the requirement that vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is

formula_6

where is the speed of light. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in -space. The assumption of periodic boundary conditions yields,

formula_7

where is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a regulator (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The zeta-regulated version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

formula_8

In the end, the limit is to be taken. Here is just a complex number, not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral sum is finite for real and larger than 3. The sum has a pole at , but may be analytically continued to , where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:

formula_9

where polar coordinates were introduced to turn the double integral into a single integral. The in front is the Jacobian, and the comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if , resulting in

formula_10

The sum diverges at in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function to is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has

formula_11

But and so one obtains

formula_12

The analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

formula_13

where
* is the reduced Planck constant,
* is the speed of light,
* is the distance between the two plates

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of shows that the Casimir force per unit area is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

By integrating the equation above it is possible to calculate the energy required to separate to infinity the two plates as:

formula_14

where
* is the reduced Planck constant,
* is the speed of light,
* is the area of one of the plates,
* is the distance between the two plates

In Casimir&#x27;s original derivation, a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance from one of two widely separated plates (distance apart). The zero-point energy on &quot;both&quot; sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above &quot;ad hoc&quot; analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using Euler–Maclaurin summation with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as in the above.

=== More recent theory ===
Casimir&#x27;s analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by Evgeny Lifshitz and his students. Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz&#x27;s theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir&#x27;s idealized force law for large separations much greater than the skin depth of the metal, and conversely reduces to the force law of the London dispersion force (with a coefficient called a Hamaker constant) for small , with a more complicated dependence on for intermediate separations determined by the dispersion of the materials.

Lifshitz&#x27;s result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions. For example, the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius is much larger than the separation , in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate force (neglecting both skin-depth and higher-order curvature effects). However, in the 2010s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical computational electromagnetics, that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.

== Measurement ==
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in (Netherlands), in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory, but with large experimental errors.

The Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the University of California, Riverside. In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a sphere with a very large radius.

In 2001, a group (Giacomo Bressi, Gianni Carugno, Roberto Onofrio and Giuseppe Ruoso) at the University of Padua (Italy) finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using microresonators. Numerous variations of these experiments are summarized in the 2009 review by Klimchitskaya.

In 2013, a conglomerate of scientists from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Florida, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrated a compact integrated silicon chip that can measure the Casimir force. The integrated chip defined by electron-beam lithography does not need extra alignment, making it an ideal platform for measuring Casimir force between complex geometries. In 2017 and 2021, the same group from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology demonstrated the non-monotonic Casimir force and distance-independent Casimir force, respectively, using this on-chip platform.

== Regularization ==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a regulator in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The heat kernel or exponentially regulated sum is
formula_15

where the limit is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

formula_16

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant which &quot;does not&quot; depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The Gaussian regulator

formula_17

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The zeta function regulator

formula_18

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the complex plane, with the bulk divergence at . This sum may be analytically continued past this pole, to obtain a finite part at .

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the plasma frequency), metals become transparent to photons (such as X-rays), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in solid state physics, mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the cutoff frequency comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in &quot;Landau and Lifshitz&quot;, &quot;Theory of Continuous Media&quot;.)

== Generalities ==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of functional integrals of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called &quot;virtual particles&quot;.

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the Van der Waals force, to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the chiral bag model of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the spectral asymmetry is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the baryon number, cancelling the topological winding number of the pion field surrounding the nucleon.

A &quot;pseudo-Casimir&quot; effect can be found in liquid crystal systems, where the boundary conditions imposed through anchoring by rigid walls give rise to a long-range force, analogous to the force that arises between conducting plates.

== Dynamical Casimir effect ==
The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated &quot;moving mirror&quot;. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect. In March 2013 an article appeared on the PNAS scientific journal describing an experiment that demonstrated the dynamical Casimir effect in a Josephson metamaterial. In July 2019 an article was published describing an experiment providing evidence of optical dynamical Casimir effect in a dispersion-oscillating fibre. In 2020, Frank Wilczek et al., proposed a resolution to the information loss paradox associated with the moving mirror model of the dynamical Casimir effect. Constructed within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the dynamical Casimir effect (moving mirror) has been used to help understand the Unruh effect.

== Repulsive forces ==
There are few instances wherein the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. Evgeny Lifshitz showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise. This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was carried out by Munday et al. who described it as &quot;quantum levitation&quot;. Other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect, though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium (Kramers–Kronig relations). Casimir and Casimir–Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al. A notable recent development on repulsive Casimir forces relies on using chiral materials. Q.-D. Jiang at Stockholm University and Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek at MIT show that chiral &quot;lubricant&quot; can generate repulsive, enhanced, and tunable Casimir interactions.

Timothy Boyer showed in his work published in 1968 that a conductor with spherical symmetry will also show this repulsive force, and the result is independent of radius. Further work shows that the repulsive force can be generated with materials of carefully chosen dielectrics.

== Speculative applications ==
It has been suggested that the Casimir forces have application in nanotechnology, in particular silicon integrated circuit technology based micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, and so-called Casimir oscillators.

In 1995 and 1998 Maclay et al. published the first models of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with Casimir forces. While not exploiting the Casimir force for useful work, the papers drew attention from the MEMS community due to the revelation that Casimir effect needs to be considered as a vital factor in the future design of MEMS. In particular, Casimir effect might be the critical factor in the stiction failure of MEMS.

In 2001, Capasso et al. showed how the force can be used to control the mechanical motion of a MEMS device, The researchers suspended a polysilicon plate from a torsional rod – a twisting horizontal bar just a few microns in diameter. When they brought a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as hysteresis and bistability in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system&#x27;s behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.

The Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in very small regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, and the energy densities cannot be arbitrarily negative as the theory breaks down at atomic distances. Such prominent physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, have speculated that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole.

<text>A coin is a small object, usually round and flat, used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government. Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them. The faces of coins or medals are sometimes called the &quot;obverse&quot; and the &quot;reverse&quot;, referring to the front and back sides, respectively. The obverse of a coin is commonly called &quot;heads&quot;, because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse is known as &quot;tails&quot;.

The first metal coins – invented in the ancient Greek world and disseminated during the Hellenistic period – were precious metal–based, and were invented in order to simplify and regularize the task of measuring and weighing bullion (bulk metal) carried around for the purpose of transactions. They carried their value within the coins themselves, but the stampings also induced manipulations, such as the clipping of coins to remove some of the precious metal.

Most modern coinage metals are base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money — the value of the coin is established by law. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulated coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, primarily due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham&#x27;s law). Currently coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually, the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. Coins are usually more efficient than banknotes because they last longer: banknotes last only about four years, compared with 30 years for a coin.

Exceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value currently occur for bullion coins made of copper, silver, or gold (and rarely other metals, such as platinum or palladium), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the British sovereign minted by the United Kingdom, the American Gold Eagle minted by the United States, the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf minted by Canada, and the Krugerrand, minted by South Africa. While the Eagle and Sovereign coins have nominal (purely symbolic) face values, the Krugerrand does not. Commemorative coins usually serve as collectors items only, although some countries also issue commemorative coins for regular circulation, such as the 2€ commemorative coins and U.S. America the Beautiful quarters.

== History ==
Early metal coinage came into use about the time of the Axial Age in West Asia, in the Greek world, in northern India, and in China.

===Bullion and unmarked metals===

Metal ingots, silver bullion or unmarked bars were probably in use for exchange among many of the civilizations that mastered metallurgy. The weight and purity of bullion would be the key determinant of value. In the Achaemenid Empire in the early 6th century BC, coinage was yet unknown. The barter system, as well as silver bullion were used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century BC. Coins were an evolution of &quot;currency&quot; systems of the Late Bronze Age, when various cultures used standard-sized ingots and tokens such as knife money to store and transfer value. Phoenician metal ingots had to be stamped with the name of a current ruler to guarantee their worth and value, which is probably how stamping busts and designs began, although political advertising – glorification of a state or of a ruler – may also play a role.

===Tongbei in Bronze Age China (c. 1100 BC)===
In the late Chinese Bronze Age, standardized cast tokens were made, such as those discovered in a tomb near Anyang. These were replicas in bronze of earlier Chinese currency, cowrie shells, so they were named &quot;Bronze Shell&quot;.

===China Henan Coin Factory (c. 640 – 550 BC)===
The world&#x27;s oldest known coin factory has been excavated in the ancient city &quot;Guanzhuang&quot; in Henan province in China. The factory produced shovel-shaped bronze coins between 640 B.C. and 550 B.C., making it the oldest securely-dated minting-site.

=== Iron Age ===

==== Lydian and Ionian electrum coins (c. 600 BC)====
The earliest coins are mostly associated with Iron Age Anatolia of the late 7th century BC, and especially with the kingdom of Lydia. Early electrum coins (an alluvial alloy of gold and silver, varying wildly in proportion, and usually about 40–55% gold) were not standardized in weight, and in their earliest stage may have been ritual objects, such as badges or medals, issued by priests. The unpredictability of the composition of naturally occurring electrum implied that it had a variable value, which greatly hampered its development.

Most of the early Lydian coins include no writing (&quot;myth&quot; or &quot;inscription&quot;), only an image of a symbolic animal. Therefore, the dating of these coins relies primarily on archaeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This was the site of the earliest known deposit of electrum coins. Anatolian Artemis was the Πότνια Θηρῶν (&quot;Potnia Thêrôn&quot;, &quot;Mistress of Animals&quot;), whose symbol was the stag. It took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day&#x27;s subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. Maybe the first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.

In contrast Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:

And both Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), mention that the first issuer of coinage was Hermodike/Demodike of Cyme. Cyme was a city in Aeolia, nearby Lydia.

Many early Lydian and Greek coins were minted under the authority of private individuals and are thus more akin to tokens or badges than to modern coins, though due to their numbers it is evident that some were official state issues. The earliest inscribed coins are those of Phanes, dated to 625–600 BC from Ephesus in Ionia, with the legend ΦΑΕΝΟΣ ΕΜΙ ΣHΜΑ (or similar) (&quot;I am the badge/sign/mark of Phanes/light&quot;) or just bearing the name ΦΑΝΕΟΣ (&quot;of Phanes&quot;).

The first electrum coins issued by a monarch are those minted by king Alyattes of Lydia (died ), for which reason this king is sometimes mentioned as the originator of coinage.

====Croesus: Pure gold and silver coins====
The successor of Alyattes, king Croesus (r. c. 560–546 BC), became associated with great wealth in Greek historiography. He is credited with issuing the &quot;Croeseid&quot;, the first true gold coins with a standardized purity for general circulation. and the world&#x27;s first bimetallic monetary system c. 550 BC.

Coins spread rapidly in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, leading to the development of Ancient Greek coinage and Achaemenid coinage, and further to Illyrian coinage.

====Achaemenid coinage (546–330 BC)====

When Cyrus the Great (550–530 BC) came to power, coinage was unfamiliar in his realm. Barter and to some extent silver bullion was used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century.

Cyrus the Great introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of Lydia and the defeat of its king Croesus, who had put in place the first coinage in history. With his conquest of Lydia, Cyrus acquired a region in which coinage was invented, developed through advanced metallurgy, and had already been in circulation for about 50 years, making the Lydian Kingdom one of the leading trade powers of the time. It seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia&#x27;s lion-and-bull coinage.

Original coins of the Achaemenid Empire were issued from 520 BC – 450 BC to 330 BC. The Persian Daric was the first truly Achaemenid gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the Siglos, represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.

=====Coinage of Southern Asia under the Achaemenid Empire=====
The Achaemenid Empire already reached the doors of India during the original expansion of Cyrus the Great, and the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley is dated to c. 515 BC under Darius I. An Achaemenid administration was established in the area. The Kabul hoard, also called the Chaman Hazouri hoard, is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan, containing numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The deposit of the hoard is dated to the Achaemenid period, in approximately 380 BC. The hoard also contained many locally produced silver coins, minted by local authorities under Achaemenid rule. Several of these issues follow the &quot;western designs&quot; of the facing bull heads, a stag, or Persian column capitals on the obverse, and incuse punch on the reverse.

According to numismatist Joe Cribb, these finds suggest that the idea of coinage and the use of punch-marked techniques was introduced to India from the Achaemenid Empire during the 4th century BC. More Achaemenid coins were also found in Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.

====Greek Archaic coinage (until about 480 BC)====

According to Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), the first issuer of Greek coinage was Hermodike of Kyme.

A small percentage of early Lydian/Greek coins have a legend. The most ancient inscribed coin known is from nearby Caria. This coin has a Greek legend reading &quot;phaenos emi sema&quot; interpreted variously as &quot;I am the badge of Phanes&quot;, or &quot;I am the sign of light&quot;. The Phanes coins are among the earliest of Greek coins; a hemihekte of the issue was found in the foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (the oldest deposit of electrum coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a mercenary mentioned by Herodotus, another that this coin is associated with the primeval god Phanes or &quot;Phanes&quot; might have been an epithet of the local goddess identified with Artemis. Barclay V. Head found these suggestions unlikely and thought it more probably &quot;the name of some prominent citizen of Ephesus&quot;.

Another candidate for the site of the earliest coins is Aegina, where Chelone (&quot;turtle&quot;) coins were first minted c. 700 BC. Coins from Athens and Corinth appeared shortly thereafter, known to exist at least since the late 6th century BC.

=== Antiquity ===

==== Classical Greek antiquity (480 BC~) ====
The Classical period saw Greek coinage reach a high level of technical and aesthetic quality. Larger cities now produced a range of fine silver and gold coins, most bearing a portrait of their patron god or goddess or a legendary hero on one side, and a symbol of the city on the other. Some coins employed a visual pun: some coins from Rhodes featured a rose, since the Greek word for rose is &quot;rhodon&quot;. The use of inscriptions on coins also began, usually the name of the issuing city.

The wealthy cities of Sicily produced some especially fine coins. The large silver &quot;decadrachmes&quot; (10-drachmes) coin from Syracuse is regarded by many collectors as the finest coin produced in the ancient world, perhaps ever. Syracusan issues were rather standard in their imprints, one side bearing the head of the nymph Arethusa and the other usually a victorious quadriga. The tyrants of Syracuse were fabulously rich, and part of their public relations policy was to fund quadrigas for the Olympic chariot race, a very expensive undertaking. As they were often able to finance more than one quadriga at a time, they were frequent victors in this highly prestigious event. Syracuse was one of the epicenters of numismatic art during the classical period. Led by the engravers Kimon and Euainetos, Syracuse produced some of the finest coin designs of antiquity.

Amongst the first centers to produce coins during the Greek colonization of Southern Italy (the so-called &quot;Magna Graecia&quot;) were Paestum, Crotone, Sybaris, Caulonia, Metapontum, and Taranto. These ancient cities started producing coins from 550 BC to 510 BC.

Amisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy. In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.

====Appearance of dynastic portraiture (5th century BC) ====

Although many of the first coins illustrated the images of various gods, the first portraiture of actual rulers appears with the coinage of Lycia in the 5th century BC. No ruler had dared illustrating his own portrait on coinage until that time. The Achaemenids had been the first to illustrate the person of their king or a hero in a stereotypical manner, showing a bust or the full body but never an actual portrait, on their Sigloi and Daric coinage from c. 500 BC. A slightly earlier candidate for the first portrait-coin is Themistocles the Athenian general, who became a Governor of Magnesia on the Meander, c. 465–459 BC, for the Achaemenid Empire, although there is some question as to whether his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already current in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynasty who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.
====Indian coins (c. 400 BC – AD 100)====

The Karshapana is the earliest punch-marked coin found in India, produced from at least the mid-4th century BC, and possibly as early as 575 BC, influenced by similar coins produced in Gandhara under the Achaemenid empire, such as those of the Kabul hoard, or other examples found at Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.

====Chinese round coins (350 BC~) ====
In China, early round coins appeared in the 4th century BC and were adopted for all China by Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di at the end of 3rd century BC. The round coin, the precursor of the familiar cash coin, circulated in both the spade and knife money areas in the Zhou period, from around 350 BC. Apart from two small and presumably late coins from the State of Qin, coins from the spade money area have a round hole and refer to the &quot;jin&quot; and &quot;liang&quot; units. Those from the knife money area have a square hole and are denominated in &quot;hua&quot; (化).

Although for discussion purposes the Zhou coins are divided up into categories of knives, spades, and round coins, it is apparent from archaeological finds that most of the various kinds circulated together. A hoard found in 1981, near Hebi in north Henan province, consisted of: 3,537 Gong spades, 3 Anyi arched foot spades, 8 Liang &quot;Dang Lie&quot; spades, 18 Liang square foot spades and 1,180 Yuan round coins, all contained in three clay jars.

==== Hellenistic period (320 BC – AD 30) ====
The Hellenistic period was characterized by the spread of Greek culture across a large part of the known world. Greek-speaking kingdoms were established in Egypt and Syria, and for a time also in Iran and as far east as what is now Afghanistan and northwestern India. Greek traders spread Greek coins across this vast area, and the new kingdoms soon began to produce their own coins. Because these kingdoms were much larger and wealthier than the Greek city states of the classical period, their coins tended to be more mass-produced, as well as larger, and more frequently in gold. They often lacked the aesthetic delicacy of coins of the earlier period.

Still, some of the Greco-Bactrian coins, and those of their successors in India, the Indo-Greeks, are considered the finest examples of Greek numismatic art with &quot;a nice blend of realism and idealization&quot;, including the largest coins to be minted in the Hellenistic world: the largest gold coin was minted by Eucratides (reigned 171–145 BC), the largest silver coin by the Indo-Greek king Amyntas Nikator (reigned c. 95–90 BC). The portraits &quot;show a degree of individuality never matched by the often bland depictions of their royal contemporaries further West&quot; (Roger Ling, &quot;Greece and the Hellenistic World&quot;).
==== Roman period (290 BC~) ====
Coinage followed Greek colonization and influence first around the Mediterranean and soon after to North Africa (including Egypt), Syria, Persia, and the Balkans. Coins came late to the Roman Republic compared with the rest of the Mediterranean, especially Greece and Asia Minor where coins were invented in the 7th century BC. The currency of central Italy was influenced by its natural resources, with bronze being abundant (the Etruscans were famous metal workers in bronze and iron) and silver ore being scarce. The coinage of the Roman Republic started with a few silver coins apparently devised for trade with Celtic in northern Italy and the Greek colonies in Southern Italy, and heavy cast bronze pieces for use in Central Italy. The first Roman coins, which were crude, heavy cast bronzes, were issued c. 289 BC.
Amisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to about 550 BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy. In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.

=== Middle Ages ===


Charlemagne, in 800 AD, implemented a series of reforms upon becoming &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot;, including the issuance of a standard coin, the silver penny. Between 794 and 1200 the penny was the only denomination of coin in Western Europe. Minted without oversight by bishops, cities, feudal lords and fiefdoms, by 1160, coins in Venice contained only 0.05g of silver, while England&#x27;s coins were minted at 1.3g. Large coins were introduced in the mid-13th century. In England, a dozen pennies was called a &quot;shilling&quot; and twenty shillings a &quot;pound&quot;: consistent with e.g. France.

Debasement of coin was widespread. There were periods of significant debasement in 1340–60 and 1417–29, when no small coins were minted, and by the 15th century the issuance of small coin was further restricted by government restrictions and even prohibitions. With the exception of the Great Debasement, England&#x27;s coins were consistently minted from sterling silver (silver content of 92.5%). A lower quality of silver with more copper mixed in, used in Barcelona, was called billon. The first European coin to use Arabic numerals to date the year in which the coin was minted was the St. Gall silver &quot;Plappart&quot; of 1424.

Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the Florentine florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history and one of the most important coins in Western history, was struck in Florence in the 13th century, while the Venetian sequin, minted from 1284 to 1797, was the most prestigious gold coin in circulation in the commercial centers of the Mediterranean Sea. The Florentine florin was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities since the 7th century to play a significant commercial role. The Florentine florin was used for larger transactions such as those used in dowries, international trade or for tax-related matters.

=== Modern history ===
Genoese coins became important in the 16th century during the Golden age of Genoese banking, with the Spanish Empire funnelling its massive wealth from Spanish America through the Bank of Saint George. With the decline in the fortunes of the Genoese banks and the Spanish Empire in the 17th century, however, the Genoese lira also depreciated substantially. The silver scudo&#x27;s value increased to 6.5 lire in 1646, 7.4 lire in 1671, and 8.74 lire just before the Austrian occupation of Genoa in 1746.

Variations in the mass of precious metals used in international trade, particularly in imports of spices and textiles into Europe, explain the numerous monetary reforms that occurred in this period. The effect of these transactions on the available reserves of gold and silver was at the origin of the various monetary reforms, which changed the price of silver compared to gold. Faced with the distinct monetary systems developed by Genoa, Venice or Florence, the widespread use in the 15th century of the silver thaler, of constant size and mass, allowed conversion operations to be limited and therefore exchanges facilitated. The thaler was the monetary unit of the Germanic countries until the 19th century and is considered the ancestor of the United States dollar. At the same time, the Mexican Mint was established on May 11, 1535, by order of the Spanish king following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Opened in April 1536, this mint had the right to mint silver Spanish real which became the basis of the monetary system of the Spanish Empire. Louis XIII had the Louis d&#x27;or minted in 1640 to compete with these coins.

The first attested siege coins appeared at the siege of Pavia in 1524. Auxiliary coins consisted, among the Greeks and Romans as in our modern societies, of coins strongly linked to copper. In particular, the red copper alloy was used for its physical properties, suitable for objects constantly subjected to manipulation: malleability, resistance to impacts, wear and corrosion (only gold has better resistance to corrosion). This alloy was often mixed with a little tin, zinc and especially nickel for their anti-corrosive, ductile and anti-fouling properties.

== Value ==


=== Currency ===
Most coins presently are made of a base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money. This means that the value of the coin is established by law, and thus is determined by the free market only in as much as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded in the international market. Thus, these coins are monetary tokens, just as paper currency is: their value is usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of government guarantee. Thus, there is very little economic difference between notes and coins of equivalent face value.

Coins may be in circulation with face values lower than the value of their component metals, but they are never initially issued with such value, and the shortfall only arises over time due to inflation, as market values for the metal overtake the face value of the coin. Examples are the pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar (containing slightly less than a tenth, quarter, half, and full ounce of silver, respectively), US nickel, and pre-1982 US penny. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between face values and metal values of coins cause coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realize the value of their metal content. This is an example of Gresham&#x27;s law. The United States Mint, in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels. Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years.

=== Collector&#x27;s items ===

A coin&#x27;s value as a collector&#x27;s item or as an investment generally depends on its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality, beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. The value of bullion coins is also influenced to some extent by those factors, but is largely based on the value of their gold, silver, or platinum content. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the Canadian Maple Leaf and the American Gold Eagle are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these face values have no relevance.

Collector catalogs often include information about coins to assists collectors with identifying and grading. Additional resources can be found online for collectors These are collector clubs, collection management tools, marketplaces, trading platforms, and forums,

=== Media of expression ===

Coins can be used as creative media of expression – from fine art sculpture to the penny machines that can be found in most amusement parks. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the United States there are some regulations specific to nickels and pennies that are informative on this topic. 31 CFR § 82.1 forbids unauthorized persons from exporting, melting, or treating any 5 or 1 cent coins.

This has been a particular problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while, the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the US Treasury. This was more of a problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration make more sense historically.

31 CFR § 82.2(b) goes on to state that: &quot;The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins.&quot;

=== Debasement and clipping ===

Throughout history, monarchs and governments have often created more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow if the coins were pure metal. By replacing some fraction of a coin&#x27;s precious metal content with a base metal (often copper or nickel), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby &quot;debasing&quot; the money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement occasionally occurs in order to make the coin physically harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly, but the more usual reason is to profit from the difference between face value and metal value. Debasement of money almost always leads to price inflation. Sometimes price controls are at the same time also instituted by the governing authority, but historically these have generally proved unworkable.

The United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is valued at 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents&#x27; worth of copper.

Some denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of a half cent, two cents, three cents, and twenty cents. (The half dollar and dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) In the past, the US also coined the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five-cent coins (known then as &quot;half dimes&quot;) were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollar coins were also much larger, and weighed approximately an ounce. One-dollar gold coins are no longer produced and rarely used. The US also issues bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50¢, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.

Circulating coins commonly suffered from &quot;shaving&quot; or &quot;clipping&quot;: the public would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to sell it and then pass on the mutilated coins at full value. Unmilled British sterling silver coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in Tudor England was commented on by Sir Thomas Gresham, whose name was later attached to Gresham&#x27;s law. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally. Many coins have milled or reeded edges, originally designed to make it easier to detect clipping.

=== Cutting ===

Some coins made of precious metals were manufactured with a cross on one side to make it easier to split the coin into halves or quarters.

=== Other uses ===

Some convicted criminals from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called &quot;convict love tokens&quot; or &quot;leaden hearts&quot;. Some of these tokens are in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

== Modern features ==

The side of a coin carrying an image of a monarch, other authority (&quot;see List of people on coins&quot;), or a national emblem is called the &quot;obverse&quot; (colloquially, &quot;heads&quot;); the other side, carrying various types of information, is called the &quot;reverse&quot; (colloquially, &quot;tails&quot;). The year of minting is usually shown on the obverse, although some Chinese coins, most Canadian coins, the pre-2008 British 20p coin, the post-1999 American quarter, and all Japanese coins are exceptions.

The relation of the images on the obverse and reverse of a coin is the coin&#x27;s orientation. If the image on the obverse of the coin is right side up and turning the coin left or right on its vertical axis reveals that the reverse of the coin is also right side up, then the coin is said to have medallic orientation—typical of the Euro and pound sterling; if, however, turning the coin left or right shows that the reverse image is upside down, then the coin is said to have coin orientation, characteristic of the coins of the United States dollar.

Bimetallic coins are sometimes used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating bimetallic examples include the €1, €2, British £1, £2 and Canadian $2 and several peso coins in Mexico.

The &quot;exergue&quot; is the space on a coin beneath the main design, often used to show the coin&#x27;s date, although it is sometimes left blank or contains a mint mark, privy mark, or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins do not have an exergue at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.
Not all coins are round; they come in a variety of shapes. The Australian 50-cent coin, for example, has twelve flat sides. Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of Hong Kong and the 10-cent coins of Bahamas. Some are square-shaped, such as the 15-cent coin of the Bahamas and the 50-cent coin from Aruba. During the 1970s, Swazi coins were minted in several shapes, including squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.

Historically, a considerable variety of coinage metals (including alloys) and other materials (e.g. porcelain) have been used to produce coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment: bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.

Some other coins, like the British 20 and 50 pence coins and the Canadian Loonie, have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This way the coin has a constant diameter, recognizable by vending machines whichever direction it is inserted.

A triangular coin with a face value of £5 (produced to commemorate the 2007/2008 Tutankhamun exhibition at The O2 Arena) was commissioned by the Isle of Man: it became legal tender on 6 December 2007. Other triangular coins issued earlier include: Cabinda coin, Bermuda coin, 2 Dollar Cook Islands 1992 triangular coin, Uganda Millennium Coin and Polish Sterling-Silver 10-Zloty Coin.

Some medieval coins, called bracteates, were so thin they were struck on only one side.

Many coins over the years have been manufactured with integrated holes such as Chinese &quot;cash&quot; coins, Japanese coins, Colonial French coins, etc. This may have been done to permit their being strung on cords, to facilitate storage and being carried. Nowadays, holes help to differentiate coins of similar size and metal, such as the Japanese 50 yen and 100 yen coin.


The Royal Canadian Mint is now able to produce holographic-effect gold and silver coinage. However, this procedure is not limited to only bullion or commemorative coinage. The 500 yen coin from Japan was subject to a massive amount of counterfeiting. The Japanese government in response produced a circulatory coin with a holographic image.

The Royal Canadian Mint has also released several coins that are colored, the first of which was in commemoration of Remembrance Day. The subject was a colored poppy on the reverse of a 25-cent piece minted through a patented process.

An example of non-metallic composite coins (sometimes incorrectly called plastic coins) was introduced into circulation in Transnistria on 22 August 2014. Most of these coins are also non-circular, with different shapes corresponding to different coin values.

For a list of many pure metallic elements and their alloys which have been used in actual circulation coins and for trial experiments, see coinage metals.

== Physics and chemistry ==
=== Flipping ===

To flip a coin to see whether it lands &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; is to use it as a two-sided die in what is known in mathematics as a Bernoulli trial: if the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a &quot;success&quot;) is exactly 0.5, the coin is fair.

=== Spinning ===

Coins can also be spun on a flat surface such as a table. This results in the following phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler&#x27;s Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.

===Odor===
Iron and copper coins have a characteristic metallic smell that is produced upon contact with oils in the skin. Perspiration is chemically reduced upon contact with these metals, which causes the skin oils to decompose, forming with iron the volatile molecule 1-octen-3-one.

==Regional examples==
===Philippines===

In the Philippines, small, engraved gold coins called Piloncitos have been excavated, some as lightweight as 0.09 to 2.65 grams. Piloncitos have been unearthed from Mandaluyong, Bataan, the banks of the Pasig River, Batangas, Marinduque, Samar, Leyte and some areas in Mindanao. Large quantities were found in Indonesian archaeological sites, suggesting that they may not have originated in the Philippines, but rather were imported. However, numerous Spanish accounts state that the gold coins were mined and made in the Philippines, such as the following from 1586:

The term &quot;Piloncitos&quot; is a contemporary word, used by modern-day antique collectors, who thought that the cone-shaped pieces looked like a pilon of sugar. Early historical descriptions of the term include the Spanish &quot;granitas de oro&quot; (small grains of gold), or simply by whatever local language terms were used to mean &quot;gold&quot; in those times, such as &quot;bulawan.&quot;

Piloncitos are presumably an offshoot of silver coinage and may have evolved into the bullet or pod duang coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.

Early historical records document the extensive use of gold throughout the Philippine archipelago before the arrival of European colonists. It was used extensively as currency, and also used in everyday items such as clothing and finery.

<doc id="7561" wikidata="Q645924" url="?curid=7561" title="Classical Kuiper belt object">
<text>A classical Kuiper belt object, also called a cubewano ( &quot;QB1-o&quot;), is a low-eccentricity Kuiper belt object (KBO) that orbits beyond Neptune and is not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune. Cubewanos have orbits with semi-major axes in the 40–50 AU range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune&#x27;s orbit. That is, they have low-eccentricity and sometimes low-inclination orbits like the classical planets.

The name &quot;cubewano&quot; derives from the first trans-Neptunian object (TNO) found after Pluto and Charon: 15760 Albion, which until January 2018 had only the provisional designation (15760) . Similar objects found later were often called &quot;QB1-os&quot;, or &quot;cubewanos&quot;, after this object, though the term &quot;classical&quot; is much more frequently used in the scientific literature.

Objects identified as cubewanos include:
* 15760 Albion (aka and gave rise to term &#x27;Cubewano&#x27;)
* 136472 Makemake, the largest known cubewano and a dwarf planet 
* 50000 Quaoar and 20000 Varuna, each considered the largest TNO at the time of discovery 
* 19521 Chaos, 58534 Logos, 53311 Deucalion, 66652 Borasisi, 88611 Teharonhiawako
* 486958 Arrokoth

136108 Haumea was provisionally listed as a cubewano by the Minor Planet Center in 2006, but was later found to be in a resonant orbit.


There are two basic dynamical classes of classical Kuiper-belt bodies: those with relatively unperturbed (&#x27;cold&#x27;) orbits, and those with markedly perturbed (&#x27;hot&#x27;) orbits.

Most cubewanos are found between the 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune (populated by plutinos) and the 1:2 resonance. 50000 Quaoar, for example, has a near-circular orbit close to the ecliptic. Plutinos, on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than Neptune.

The majority of classical objects, the so-called &quot;cold population&quot;, have low inclinations (&lt; 5°) and near-circular orbits, lying between 42 and 47 AU. A smaller population (the &quot;hot population&quot;) is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits. The terms &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;cold&#x27; has nothing to do with surface or internal temperatures, but rather refer to the orbits of the objects, by analogy to molecules in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they heat up.

The Deep Ecliptic Survey reports the distributions of the two populations; one with the inclination centered at 4.6° (named &quot;Core&quot;) and another with inclinations extending beyond 30° (&quot;Halo&quot;).

=== Distribution ===
The vast majority of KBOs (more than two-thirds) have inclinations of less than 5° and eccentricities of less than 0.1 . Their semi-major axes show a preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.

The &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;cold&#x27; populations are strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, near-circular orbits. The parameters of the plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in 0.15–0.2 range, and low inclinations 5–10°.
See also the comparison with scattered disk objects.

Cubewanos form a clear &#x27;belt&#x27; outside Neptune&#x27;s orbit, whereas the plutinos approach, or even cross Neptune&#x27;s orbit. When orbital inclinations are compared, &#x27;hot&#x27; cubewanos can be easily distinguished by their higher inclinations, as the plutinos typically keep orbits &lt;20°. The high inclination of &#x27;hot&#x27; cubewanos has not been explained.


== Cold and hot populations: physical characteristics ==
In addition to the distinct orbital characteristics, the two populations display different physical characteristics.

The difference in colour between the red cold population, such as 486958 Arrokoth, and more heterogeneous hot population was observed as early as in 2002.
Recent studies, based on a larger data set, indicate the cut-off inclination of 12° (instead of 5°) between the cold and hot populations and confirm the distinction between the homogenous red cold population and the bluish hot population.

Another difference between the low-inclination (cold) and high-inclination (hot) classical objects is the observed number of binary objects. Binaries are quite common on low-inclination orbits and are typically similar-brightness systems. Binaries are less common on high-inclination orbits and their components typically differ in brightness. This correlation, together with the differences in colour, support further the suggestion that the currently observed classical objects belong to at least two different overlapping populations, with different physical properties and orbital history.

== Toward a formal definition ==
There is no official definition of &#x27;cubewano&#x27; or &#x27;classical KBO&#x27;. However, the terms are normally used to refer to objects free from significant perturbation from Neptune, thereby excluding KBOs in orbital resonance with Neptune (resonant trans-Neptunian objects). The Minor Planet Center (MPC) and the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) do not list cubewanos (classical objects) using the same criteria. Many TNOs classified as cubewanos by the MPC, such as dwarf planet Makemake, are classified as ScatNear (possibly scattered by Neptune) by the DES. may be an inner cubewano near the plutinos. Furthermore, there is evidence that the Kuiper belt has an &#x27;edge&#x27;, in that an apparent lack of low-inclination objects beyond 47–49 AU was suspected as early as 1998 and shown with more data in 2001. Consequently, the traditional usage of the terms is based on the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis, and includes objects situated between the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances, that is between 39.4 and 47.8 AU (with exclusion of these resonances and the minor ones in-between).

These definitions lack precision: in particular the boundary between the classical objects and the scattered disk remains blurred. , there are 870 objects with perihelion (q) &gt; 40 AU and aphelion (Q) &lt; 48 AU.

=== DES classification ===
Introduced by the report from the Deep Ecliptic Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. in 2005 uses formal criteria based on the mean orbital parameters. Put informally, the definition includes the objects that have never crossed the orbit of Neptune. According to this definition, an object qualifies as a classical KBO if:
* it is not resonant
* its average Tisserand&#x27;s parameter with respect to Neptune exceeds 3
* its average eccentricity is less than 0.2.

=== SSBN07 classification ===
An alternative classification, introduced by B. Gladman, B. Marsden and C. van Laerhoven in 2007, uses a 10-million-year orbit integration instead of the Tisserand&#x27;s parameter. Classical objects are defined as not resonant and not being currently scattered by Neptune.

Formally, this definition includes as &quot;classical&quot; all objects with their &quot;current&quot; orbits that
*are non-resonant (see the definition of the method)
*have a semi-major axis greater than that of Neptune (30.1 AU; i.e. excluding centaurs) but less than 2000 AU (to exclude inner-Oort-cloud objects)
*are not being scattered by Neptune
*have their eccentricity formula_1 (to exclude detached objects)
Unlike other schemes, this definition includes the objects with major semi-axis less than 39.4 AU (2:3 resonance)—termed inner classical belt, or more than 48.7 (1:2 resonance) – termed outer classical belt, and reserves the term main classical belt for the orbits between these two resonances.

== Families ==
The first known collisional family in the classical Kuiper belt—a group of objects thought to be remnants from the breakup of a single body—is the Haumea family. It includes Haumea, its moons, and seven smaller bodies. The objects not only follow similar orbits but also share similar physical characteristics. Unlike many other KBO their surface contains large amounts of water ice (H2O) and no or very little tholins. The surface composition is inferred from their neutral (as opposed to red) colour and deep absorption at 1.5 and 2. μm in infrared spectrum. Several other collisional families might reside in the classical Kuiper belt.

== Exploration ==
As of January 2019, only one classical Kuiper belt object has been observed up close by spacecraft. Both Voyager spacecraft have passed through the region before the discovery of the Kuiper belt. New Horizons was the first mission to visit a classical KBO. After its successful exploration of the Pluto system in 2015, the NASA spacecraft has visited the small KBO 486958 Arrokoth at a distance of on 1 January 2019.

<text>The officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States of America, including all the bureaus and offices in the United States Department of State, as mentioned in the &quot;Foreign Policy Agenda&quot; of the Department of State, are &quot;to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community&quot;. Liberalism has been a key component of US foreign policy since its independence from Britain. Since the end of World War II, the United States has had a grand strategy which has been characterized as being oriented around primacy, &quot;deep engagement&quot;, and/or liberal hegemony. This strategy entails that the United States maintains military predominance; builds and maintains an extensive network of allies (exemplified by NATO, bilateral alliances and foreign US military bases); integrates other states into US-designed international institutions (such as the IMF, WTO/GATT and World Bank); and limits the spread of nuclear weapons.

The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs states as some of its jurisdictional goals: &quot;export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial interaction with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad; international commodity agreements; international education; protection of American citizens abroad; and expulsion&quot;. U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid have been the subject of much debate and criticism, both domestically and abroad.
== Foreign policy development ==
Article Two of the United States Constitution grants power of foreign policy to the President of the United States, including powers to command the military, negotiate treaties, and appoint ambassadors. The Department of State carries out the president&#x27;s foreign policy. The State Department is usually pulled between the wishes of Congress, and the wishes of the residing president. The Department of Defense carries out the president&#x27;s military policy. The Central Intelligence Agency is an independent agency responsible for gathering intelligence on foreign activity. Some checks and balances are applied to the president&#x27;s powers of foreign policy. Treaties negotiated by the president require ratification by the Senate to take force as United States law. The president&#x27;s ambassadorial nominations also require Senate approval before taking office. Military actions must first be approved by both chambers of Congress.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to approve the president&#x27;s picks for ambassadors and the power to declare war. The president is commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. He appoints a Secretary of State and ambassadors with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Secretary acts similarly to a foreign minister, because they are the primary conductor of foreign affairs. While foreign policy has varied slightly from president to president, there have generally been consistently similar goals throughout different administrations.

Generally speaking there are 4 schools of thought regarding foreign policy. First is Neo-Isolationists, who believe the United States should maintain a very narrow focus and avoid all involvement in the rest of the world. Second is selective-engagement which avoids all conflicts with other nations, and is semi-restrictive on its foreign policy. Third is cooperative security, which requires more involvement throughout the world, occasionally countering threats to the country. Finally is the idea of primacy which seeks to advance the United States well beyond all other nations of the world, placing it first in all matters.

=== International law ===
Much of American foreign policy consists of international agreements made with other countries. Treaties are governed by the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause dictates that the president negotiates treaties with other countries or political entities, and signs them. For a treaty to be ratified by the provisions of this clause, it must be approved by two-thirds of the United States Senate. Typically treaties are first discussed and voted on by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. If approved, the United States exchanges the instruments of ratification with the relevant foreign states. In &quot;Missouri v. Holland&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the power to make treaties under the U.S. Constitution is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal government, and hence the federal government can use treaties to legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive authority of the states. Between 1789 and 1990, the Senate approved more than 1,500 treaties, rejected 21 and withdrew 85 without further action. As of 2019, 37 treaties were pending Senate approval.

International agreements, sometimes also collectively referred to as treaties, can also be entered into by other mechanisms, though they have different legal implications than Senate-ratified treaties. The president can unilaterally make executive agreements. Under the Supreme Court decisions &quot;United States v. Pink&quot; (1942) and &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot; (1957), these have the force of law only to the degree they were made by exercising a power in the scope of the president&#x27;s authority.

Congressional-executive agreements are commonly used to enshrine the provisions of an international compact into federal law. Under this procedure, the executive branch negotiates the language, which is then approved by Congress and signed by the President as a regular piece of legislation, only requiring a simple majority of both houses. This procedure has been upheld by federal courts, though some scholars question its constitutionality because it bypasses the explicit Senate ratification procedure spelled out for treaties.

The State Department has taken the position that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties represents established law. Following ratification, the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result, Congress can modify or repeal treaties after they are ratified. This can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if that is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings confirmed this understanding, including Supreme Court decisions in &quot;Paquete Habana v. the United States&quot; (1900), and &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot; (1957), as well as a lower court ruling in &quot;Garcia-Mir v. Meese&quot; (1986). As a result of the &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot; decision, the United States adds a reservation to the text of every treaty that says in effect that the United States intends to abide by the treaty but that if the treaty is found to be in violation of the Constitution, the United States legally is then unable to abide by the treaty since the American signature would be &quot;ultra vires&quot;.

==Historical overview==
The main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from non-interventionism before and after World War I, to its growth as a world power and global hegemon during World War II and throughout the Cold War in the 20th century. Since the 19th century, U.S. foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or stances have been variously expressed by presidential &#x27;doctrines&#x27;.

=== 18th century ===
Foreign policy themes were expressed considerably in George Washington&#x27;s farewell address; these included, among other things, observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all, excluding both &quot;inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others&quot;, &quot;steer[ing] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world&quot;, and advocating trade with all nations. Foreign policy in the first years of American independence constituted the balancing of relations with Great Britain and France. The Federalist Party supported Washington&#x27;s foreign policy and sought close ties with Britain, but the Democratic-Republican Party favored France. Under the Federalist government of John Adams, the United States engaged in conflict with France in the Quasi-War, but the rival Jeffersonians feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring the War of 1812 on Britain. Jeffersonians vigorously opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against American shipping by Barbary corsairs spurred the country into developing a navy, resulting in the First Barbary War in 1801.

=== 19th century ===
American foreign policy was mostly peaceful and marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade during the 19th century. As the Jeffersonians took power in the 1800s, they opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against American shipping by Barbary corsairs spurred the country into developing a naval force projection capability, resulting in the First Barbary War in 1801. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 doubled the nation&#x27;s geographical area. The American policy of neutrality had caused tensions to rise with Britain in the Atlantic and with Native American nations in the frontier. This led to the War of 1812 and helped cement American foreign policy as independent of Europe. After the War of 1812, there were disagreements between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton as to whether the United States should be isolated or be more involved in global activities.

In the 1820s, the Monroe Doctrine was established as the primary foreign policy doctrine of the United States, establishing Latin America as an American sphere of influence and rejecting European colonization in the region. The 1830s and 1840s were marked by increasing conflict with Mexico, exacerbated by the Texas annexation and culminating in the Mexican–American War in 1846. Following the war, the United States claimed much of what is now the Southwestern United States, and the Gadsden Purchase further expanded this territory. Relations with Britain continued to be strained as a result of border conflicts until they were resolved by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842. The Perry Expedition of 1853 led to Japan establishing relations with the United States.

The Diplomacy of the American Civil War emphasized preventing European involvement in the war. During the Civil War, Spain and France defied the Monroe Doctrine and expanded their colonial influence in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, respectively. The Alaska Purchase was negotiated with Russia in 1867 and the Newlands Resolution annexed Hawaii in 1898. The Spanish–American War took place during 1898, resulting in the United States claiming Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and causing Spain to retract claims upon Cuba. Generally speaking the Foreign Policy of the United States during this era was anchored in a policy of wealth building for the nation.

=== 20th century ===
Following the Spanish–American War, the United States entered the 20th century as an emerging great power with colonies in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Under Theodore Roosevelt, the United States adopted the Roosevelt Corollary, which indicated American willingness to use its military strength to end conflicts and wrongdoings in Latin America. Following the independence of Panama, the United States and Panama negotiated the construction of the Panama Canal, during which time the Panama Canal Zone was placed under American jurisdiction. The United States established the Open Door Policy with China during this time as well. The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which Allied powers, along with the United States, defeated their enemies, and through this participation the United States increased its international reputation.

====World War I and Interbellum====
Entry into the First World War was a hotly debated issue in the 1916 presidential election.

In response to the Russian revolutions,

President Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points was developed from his idealistic Wilsonianism program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism to prevent future wars. It became the basis of the German Armistice (which amounted to a military surrender) and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The resulting Treaty of Versailles, due to European allies&#x27; punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient conformity with these points, and the U.S. signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never joined the League of Nations, which was established as a result of Wilson&#x27;s initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an independent course, and succeeded in a program of naval disarmament, and refunding the German economy. Operating outside the League it became a dominant player in diplomatic affairs. New York became the financial capital of the world, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurled the Western industrialized world into the Great Depression. American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s. Post WWI, the United States entered back into isolation from world events. This was largely due to the Great Depression of 1929.

====World War II====


The United States adopted an isolationist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938, but this position was challenged by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated strong support of the allies, establishing the United States as the Arsenal of Democracy by providing military equipment without entering the war. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States joined the allies as combatants in World War II.

Roosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by people &quot;everywhere in the world&quot;; these included the freedom of speech and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the Atlantic Conference; specific points were included to correct earlier failures, which became a step toward the United Nations. American policy was to counter Japan, to force out of China, and to prevent attacking the Soviet Union. Japan reacted with an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of $50,000,000,000. Working closely with Winston Churchill of Britain, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes, ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. The culmination of World War II ended in the defeat of Nazi Germany, and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The post World War II era saw the rise of the United States as the global leader, which necessitated an effort by the United States to instill liberal democracy around the world.

====Cold War====
After the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant economic power with broad influence in much of the world, with the key policies of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Almost immediately, two broad camps formed during the Cold War; one side was led by the U.S. and the other by the Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement. This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers. The United States extended its influence in the years after World War II, enacting the Marshall Plan to support the reconstruction process in European countries and seeking to combat Communism through containment. This strategy of containment resulted in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War in particular was highly controversial, and its perceived failures reduced popularity for foreign intervention in the United States. The invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union contributed directly to fueling tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. This began with President Carter announcing the United States interests in maintaining the status quo within the Persian Gulf region, resulting in the Carter Doctrine. The Regan administration escalated the tensions by supporting freedom fighters around the world, most notably in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion. The Soviet Union and the United States did not engage in direct conflict, but rather supported small proxies that opposed the other. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states.

In domestic politics, foreign policy was not usually a central issue. In 1945–1970, the Democratic Party took a strong anti-Communist line and supported wars in Korea and Vietnam. Then the party split with a strong, &quot;dovish&quot;, pacifist element (typified by 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern). Many &quot;hawks&quot;, advocates for war, joined the neoconservative movement and started supporting the Republicans—especially Reagan—based on foreign policy. Meanwhile, down to 1952 the Republican Party was split between an isolationist wing, based in the Midwest and led by Senator Robert A. Taft, and an internationalist wing based in the East and led by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the 1952 nomination largely on foreign policy grounds. Since then the Republicans have been characterized by American nationalism, strong opposition to Communism, and strong support for Israel.

===21st century===
Following the end of the Cold War, the United States entered the 21st century as the sole superpower, though this status has been challenged by China, India, Russia, and the European Union. Substantial problems remain, such as climate change, nuclear proliferation, and the specter of international terrorism.

The September 11 attacks in 2001 caused a policy shift, in which America declared a &quot;war on terror&quot;. The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and invaded Iraq in 2003, emphasizing nation-building and the neutralization of terrorist threats in the Middle East. During the war on terror, the United States significantly expanded its military and intelligence capacities while also pursuing economic methods of targeting opposing governments. After a phased withdrawal from Iraq, In 2014, the Islamic State emerged as a major hostile power in the Middle East, and the United States led a military intervention in Iraq and Syria to combat it. The extended nature of American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in support for isolationism and reduced involvement in foreign conflicts.

In 2011, the United States led a NATO intervention in Libya. In 2013, disclosures of American surveillance programs revealed that United States intelligence policy included extensive global surveillance activities against foreign governments and citizens.

In 2017, diplomats from other countries developed new tactics to engage with President Donald Trump&#x27;s brand of American nationalism. Peter Baker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the eve of his first foreign trip as president that the global diplomatic community had devised a strategy of keeping interactions brief, complimenting him, and giving him something he can consider a victory. Before the Trump presidency, foreign policy in the U.S. was the result of bipartisan consensus on an agenda of strengthening its position as the number one power. That consensus has since fractured, with Republican and Democratic politicians increasingly calling for a more restrained approach. Foreign policy under the Trump administration involved heightened tensions with Iran, a trade war through increased tariffs, and a reduced role in international organizations.

Advancing a &quot;Free and Open Indo-Pacific&quot; has become the core of the U.S. national security strategy and has been embraced by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The United States ended its wars in the Greater Middle East with the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Unlike the Trump administration, which is more concerned with containing China&#x27;s influence, foreign policy of the Biden-Harris administration shifted to an increased focus on Russia following the attempted Russian election interference in 2016 and developments in the Russo-Ukrainian War. With the rise of Russia and China as co-superpowers, the United States has had to shift its relations to more cooperation rather than coercion, with Russia and China pursuing a more self serving global system.

In early 2023, when China brokered the long-awaited reconciliation of Saudi-Arabia Iran relations, the U.S. found itself on the sidelines of political developments in the Middle East. The JCPOA, which attempted to control the nuclear capabilities of Iran, was not fully reinstated after the Trump administration abandoned the international agreement supported by European powers in 2018. As China attempted to fill this vacuum, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine further tested the international alliances with the U.S. Iran and other larger powers such as India as well as Arab nations did not adopt any of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia but to the contrary, increased their economic and strategic alliances with Russia or China. As China is focussing primarily on the global expansion of its economy, Russia was able to maintain its military and energy-related influence not only in Asia but also in Africa and South America. With regard to the Middle East, trade from these nations with China is three times greater than the trade with the U.S. As China is extending its mid-East reach, Russia despite its battered economy from sanctions still remains influential in South America with trade relations that are difficult to deconstruct through U.S. American influence. While China&#x27;s influence in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Africa is still hindered by commercial and currency-related U.S. trade policies, it is perceived more and more as a peace negotiator than a communist aggressor, particularly outside of Europe and North America. While the U.S. still upholds its moral dominance by advocating for democracy, its foreign policies are increasingly marked by a perceived inability to defend its image as an exporter of peace and prosperity.

== Diplomatic policy ==
The diplomatic policy of the United States is created by the president and carried out by the Department of State. The department&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;protect and promote U.S. security, prosperity, and democratic values and shape an international environment in which all Americans can thrive.&quot; Its objectives during the 2022-2026 period include renewing U.S. leadership, promoting global prosperity, strengthening democratic institutions, revitalizing the diplomatic workforce and institutions, and serving U.S. citizens abroad. As of 2022, the United States has bilateral relations with all but four United Nations members.

The United States government emphasizes human rights in foreign policy. Annual reports produced by the Department of State, such as &quot;Advancing Freedom and Democracy&quot; and the &quot;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&quot;, track the status of human rights around the world. The National Endowment for Democracy provides financial aid to promote democracy internationally.

=== International agreements ===
The United States is party to thousands of international agreements with other countries, territories, and international organizations. These include arms control agreements, human rights treaties, environmental protocols, and free trade agreements. Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States also maintains a relationship of free association with the countries of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, grants the United States military access to the countries in exchange for military protection, foreign aid, and access domestic American agencies.

The United States is a member of many international organizations. It is a founding member of the United Nations and holds a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The United States is also a member of other global organizations, including the World Trade Organization. Regional organizations in which the United States is a member include NATO, Organization of American States, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. As the largest economy in the world, the United States is also a member of organizations for the most developed nations, including the OECD, the Group of Seven, and the G20.

==== Non-participation in multi-lateral agreements ====
The United States notably does not participate in various international agreements adhered to by almost all other industrialized countries, by almost all the countries of the Americas, or by almost all other countries in the world. With a large population and economy, on a practical level this can undermine the effect of certain agreements, or give other countries a precedent to cite for non-participation in various agreements.

In some cases the arguments against participation include that the United States should maximize its sovereignty and freedom of action, or that ratification would create a basis for lawsuits that would treat American citizens unfairly. In other cases, the debate became involved in domestic political issues, such as gun control, climate change, and the death penalty.

Examples include:
* Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations covenant (in force 1920–45, signed but not ratified)
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (took effect in 1976, ratified with substantial reservations)
* International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (took effect in 1976, signed but not ratified)
* American Convention on Human Rights (took effect in 1978)
* Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (took effect in 1981, signed but not ratified)
* Convention on the Rights of the Child (took effect in 1990, signed but not ratified)
* United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (took effect in 1994)
* Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (signed in 1996 but never ratified and never took effect)
* Mine Ban Treaty (took effect in 1999)
* International Criminal Court (took effect in 2002)
* Kyoto Protocol (in force 2005–12, signed but not ratified)
* Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (took effect in 2006)
* Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (took effect in 2008, signed but not ratified)
* Convention on Cluster Munitions (took effect in 2010)
* International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (took effect in 2010)
* Arms Trade Treaty (took effect in 2014)
* Other human rights treaties
* Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (took effect in 2016 as part of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Signed by the U.S., France, Germany, European Union, UK, Russia, China and Iran, but abandoned by the U.S. in 2018)

=== Foreign aid ===

Foreign assistance is a core component of the State Department&#x27;s international affairs budget, and aid is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral economic contributions (for example, contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund). In absolute dollar terms, the United States government is the largest international aid donor. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance, while the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid. Foreign aid is a highly partisan issue in the United States, with liberals, on average, supporting foreign aid much more than conservatives do.

The United States first began distributing regular foreign aid in the aftermath of World War II and the onset of the Cold War. Foreign aid has been used to foster closer relations with foreign nations, strengthen countries that could potentially become future allies and trading partners, and provide assistance for people of countries most in need. American foreign aid contributed to the Green Revolution in the 1960s and the democratization of Taiwan and Colombia. Since the 1970s, issues of human rights have become increasingly important in American foreign policy, and several acts of Congress served to restrict foreign aid from governments that &quot;engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights&quot;. In 2011, President Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In the 2019 fiscal year, the United States spent $39.2 billion in foreign aid, constituting less than one percent of the federal budget.

=== War on Drugs ===
United States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S. government to control imports of illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis. This is especially true in Latin America, a focus for the U.S. War on Drugs. These foreign policy efforts date back to at least the 1900s, when the U.S. banned the importation of non-medical opium and participated in the 1909 International Opium Commission, one of the first international drug conferences.

Over a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries. In September 2005, the following countries were identified: Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Two of these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably absent from the 2005 list were Afghanistan, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Vietnam; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U.S.

In 2011, overdose deaths in the U.S. were on a decline mostly due to interdiction efforts and international cooperation to reduce the production of illicit drugs. Since about 2014, a reversal of this trend could be clearly seen as legal semi-synthetic opioids and cocaine stimulants were replaced by the fully synthetic fentanyl and methamphetamine. By 2022, overdose deaths caused by illicit fentanyl led to the worst drug crisis the U.S. has ever experienced in its history, with 1,500 people dying every week of overdose-related cases. By 2022, deaths caused by fentanyl significantly reduced the life expectancy in the U.S. and were also seen as a major drag on the U.S. economy. Despite efforts to control the trade of chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl, the tide of fentanyl-related deaths continues to be a major threat to U.S. national security.

=== Regional diplomacy ===
==== Africa ====

American involvement with Africa has historically been limited. During the war on terror, the United States increased its activities in Africa to fight terrorism in conjunction with African countries as well as to support democracy in Africa through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Africa has also been the subject of competition between American and Chinese investment strategies. In 2007 the U.S. was Sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s largest single export market accounting for 28% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31%). 81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.

==== Asia ====

America&#x27;s relations with Asia have tended to be based on a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model instead of multilateral relations, using a series of bilateral relationships where states coordinate with the United States instead of through a unified bloc. On May 30, 2009, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as ASEAN, APEC and the ad hoc arrangements in the area. In 2011, Gates said the United States must serve as the &quot;indispensable nation&quot;, for building multilateral cooperation. As of 2022, the Department of Defense considers China to be the greatest threat to the policy goals of the United States.

==== Canada ====

Canada has historically been a close ally to the United States, and their foreign policies often work in conjunction. The armed forces of Canada and the United States have a high level of interoperability, and domestic air force operations have been fully integrated between the two countries through NORAD. Almost all of Canada&#x27;s energy exports go to the United States, making it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports; Canada is consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports. Trade between the United States and Canada as well as Mexico is facilitated through the USMCA.

==== Europe ====

The United States has close ties with the European Union, and it is a member of NATO along with several European countries. The United States has close relations with most countries of Europe. Much of American foreign policy has involved combating the Soviet Union in the 20th century and Russia in the 21st century.

==== Latin America ====

The Monroe Doctrine has historically made up the foreign policy of the United States in regard to Latin America. Under this policy, the United States would consider Latin America to be under its sphere of influence and defend Latin American countries from European hostilities. The United States was heavily involved in the politics of Panama during the early-20th century in order to construct the Panama Canal. Cuba was an ally of the United States following its independence, but it was identified as a major national security threat following the Cuban Revolution; Cuba–United States relations remain poor.

==== Middle East ====
The Middle East region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II, and relations were secured with Saudi Arabia to secure additional oil supplies. The Middle East continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the Cold War, and American containment policy emphasized preventing Soviet influence from taking hold in the Middle East. The Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, and the Nixon Doctrine all played roles in the formulation of the Carter Doctrine, which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf region. Carter&#x27;s successor, President Ronald Reagan, extended the policy in October 1981 with the Reagan Doctrine, which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War. During the so-called war on terror, the United States increased its involvement in the region; some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine also played a role in the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq War.

Two-thirds of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves are estimated to be found in the Persian Gulf, and the United States imports oil from several Middle Eastern countries. While its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s, new hydraulic fracturing techniques and discovery of shale oil deposits in Canada and the American Dakotas offer the potential for increased energy independence from oil exporting countries such as OPEC.

==== Oceania ====

Australia and New Zealand are close allies of the United States. Together, the three countries compose the ANZUS collective security agreement. The United States and the United Kingdom also have a separate agreement, AUKUS, with Australia. After it captured the islands from Japan during World War II, the United States administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986 (1994 for Palau). The Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. territory (part of the United States), while Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau became independent countries. Each has signed a Compact of Free Association that gives the United States exclusive military access in return for U.S. defense protection and conduct of military foreign affairs (except the declaration of war) and a few billion dollars of aid. These agreements also generally allow citizens of these countries to live and work in the United States with their spouses (and vice versa), and provide for largely free trade. The federal government also grants access to services from domestic agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Weather Service, the United States Postal Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and U.S. representation to the International Frequency Registration Board of the International Telecommunication Union.

==Defense policy==

Defense policy of the United States is established by the president under the role of commander-in-chief, and it is carried out by the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. As of 2022, the stated objective of the Department of Defense is to deter attacks against the United States and its allies in order to protect the American people, expand America&#x27;s prosperity, and defend democratic values. The department recognizes China as the greatest foreign threat to the United States, with Russia, North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations recognized as other major foreign threats. Most American troops stationed in foreign countries operate in non-combat roles. As of 2021, about 173,000 troops are deployed in 159 countries. Japan, Germany, and South Korea are host to the largest numbers of American troops due to continued military cooperation following World War II and the Korean War. The United States has not been involved in a major war since the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan in 2021, though American forces continue to operate against terrorist groups in the Middle East and Africa through the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001. The United States also provides billions of dollars of military aid to allied countries each year.

The Constitution of the United States requires that Congress authorize any military conflict initiated by the president. This has been carried out through formal declarations of war, Congressional authorizations without formal declaration, and through United Nations Security Council Resolutions that are legally recognized by Congress. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 limited the ability of the president to use the military without Congressional authorization. Prior to 2001, 125 instances of American presidents using military force without Congressional authorization had been identified. Since 2001, the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001 (AUMF) has granted the president the power to engage in military conflict with any country, organization, or person that was involved in carrying out the September 11 attacks. American presidents have since interpreted the AUMF to authorize military campaigns against terrorist groups associated with Al-Qaeda in several countries.

=== Alliances and partnerships ===
The Department of Defense considers cooperation with American allies and partners to be &quot;critical&quot; to achieving American defense objectives. The department makes a distinction between alliances, which are formal military agreements between countries through a treaty, and strategic partnerships, which are military cooperation agreements that aren&#x27;t bound by specific terms. The United States military works in cooperation with many national governments, and the United States has approximately 750 military bases in at least 80 different countries. In addition to military agreements, the United States is a member of multiple international disarmament organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The United States is a founding member of NATO, an alliance of 29 North American and European nations formed to defend Western Europe against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Under the NATO charter, the United States legally recognizes any attack on a NATO member as an attack on all NATO members. The United States is also a founding member of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, an alliance of 19 North and South American nations. The United States is one of the three members of ANZUS, along with Australia and New Zealand, and it also has military alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for the defense of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The United States has also designated several countries as major non-NATO allies. These are countries that are not members of NATO but are granted certain privileges in regard to defense trade and security cooperation, including eligibility for certain trade deals and research collaboration. The president is empowered to designate additional foreign countries as major non-NATO allies.

Since it became a superpower in the mid-20th century, the United States has primarily carried out defense operations by leading and participating in multilateral coalitions. These coalitions may be constructed around existing defensive alliances, such as NATO, or through separate coalitions constructed through diplomatic negotiations and acting in a common interest. The United States has not engaged in unilateral military action since the invasion of Panama in 1989. United States military action may take place in accordance with or in opposition to the wishes of the United Nations. The United States has opposed the expansion of United Nations peacekeeping beyond its previous scope, instead supporting the use of multilateral coalitions in hostile countries and territories.

===Military aid===

The U.S. provides military aid through many channels, including direct funding, support for training, or distribution of military equipment. Military aid spending has varied over time, with spending reaching as high as $35 billion in 1952, adjusted for inflation. The United States established a cohesive military aid policy during World War II, when the Lend-Lease program was implemented to support the Allied powers. After the war, the United States continued to provide military aid in line with other foreign aid programs to support American allies. Programs such as Foreign Military Financing and Foreign Military Sales oversee distribution of military aid.

According to a 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. topped the market in global weapon sales for 2015, with $40 billion sold. The largest buyers were Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Pakistan, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. In 2020, the United States distributed $11.6 billion in military aid, the lowest since 2004. Military aid is one of the main forms of foreign aid, with 23% of American foreign aid in 2020 taking the form of military aid. Afghanistan was the primary recipient of American military aid in the 2010s. In 2022, military aid policy in the United States shifted from Afghanistan to Ukraine following the end of the War in Afghanistan and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of 2021, the United States has military bases in at least 80 countries.

The table below outlines the ten largest recipients of United States military aid in 2020 and their estimated aid in billions.

===Missile defense===

The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a proposal by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983 to use ground and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles, later dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Though it was never fully developed or deployed, the research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti-ballistic missile systems of today.

In February 2007, the U.S. started formal negotiations with Poland and Czech Republic concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system (in April 2007, 57% of Poles opposed the plan). According to press reports, the government of the Czech Republic agreed (while 67% Czechs disagree) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland.

Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia&#x27;s border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States.

On August 14, 2008, the United States and Poland announced a deal to implement the missile defense system in Polish territory, with a tracking system placed in the Czech Republic. &quot;The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that, of course, the missile defense system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia&quot;, Dmitry Rogozin, Russia&#x27;s NATO envoy, said.

Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press, argue in Foreign Affairs that U.S. missile defenses are designed to secure Washington&#x27;s nuclear primacy and are chiefly directed at potential rivals, such as Russia and China. The authors note that Washington continues to eschew nuclear first strike and contend that deploying missile defenses &quot;would be valuable primarily in an offensive context, not a defensive one; as an adjunct to a US First Strike capability, not as a stand-alone shield&quot;:

If the United States launched a nuclear attack against Russia (or China), the targeted country would be left with only a tiny surviving arsenal, if any at all. At that point, even a relatively modest or inefficient missile defense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes.

This analysis is corroborated by the Pentagon&#x27;s 1992 Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), prepared by then Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and his deputies. The DPG declares that the United States should use its power to &quot;prevent the reemergence of a new rival&quot; either on former Soviet territory or elsewhere. The authors of the Guidance determined that the United States had to &quot;Field a missile defense system as a shield against accidental missile launches or limited missile strikes by &#x27;international outlaws&#x27;&quot; and also must &quot;Find ways to integrate the &#x27;new democracies&#x27; of the former Soviet bloc into the U.S.-led system&quot;. The National Archive notes that Document 10 of the DPG includes wording about &quot;disarming capabilities to destroy&quot; which is followed by several blacked out words. &quot;This suggests that some of the heavily excised pages in the still-classified DPG drafts may include some discussion of preventive action against threatening nuclear and other WMD programs.&quot;

Robert David English, writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, observes that the DPG&#x27;s second recommendation has also been proceeding on course. &quot;Washington has pursued policies that have ignored Russian interests (and sometimes international law as well) in order to encircle Moscow with military alliances and trade blocs conducive to U.S. interests.&quot;

On September 12, 2024, the U.S. disclosed that Russia obtained ballistic missiles from Iran for its war in Ukraine, leading to new sanctions on Russian entities involved. The U.S. also targeted Iran Air and other organizations linked to Iran’s missile activities, though Iran denies supplying the weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Ukraine and Poland to discuss further support, as Ukraine urges stronger actions.

===Exporting democracy===


Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations. Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been &quot;negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive&quot;. Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.

== Intelligence policy ==
Intelligence policy is developed by the president and carried out by the United States Intelligence Community, led by the Director of National Intelligence. The Intelligence Community includes 17 offices and bureaus within various executive departments as well as the Central Intelligence Agency. Its stated purpose is to utilize insights, protected information, and understanding of adversaries to advance national security, economic strength, and technological superiority.

The Intelligence Community provides support for all diplomatic and military action undertaken by the United States and serves to inform government and military decision-making, as well as collecting and analyzing global economic and environmental information. The primary functions of the Intelligence Community are the collection and analysis of information, and it is responsible for collecting information on foreign subjects that is not available publicly or through diplomatic channels. Collection of information typically takes the form of signals intelligence, imagery intelligence, and human intelligence. Information collected by American intelligence is used to counter foreign intelligence, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, WMD proliferation, and international organized crime.

=== Counterintelligence ===
The Intelligence Community is responsible for counterintelligence to protect the United States from foreign intelligence services. The Central Intelligence Agency is responsible for counterintelligence activities abroad, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for combating foreign intelligence operations in the United States. The goal of American counterintelligence is to protect classified government information as well as trade secrets of American industry. Offensive counterintelligence operations undertaken by the United States include recruiting foreign intelligence agents, monitoring suspected foreign agents, and collecting information on the intentions of foreign intelligence services, while defensive counterintelligence operations include investigating suspected cases of espionage and producing analyses of foreign intelligence threats.

Counterintelligence operations in the United States began when the Espionage Act of 1917 was used to prosecute German infiltrators and saboteurs during World War I. Today, counterintelligence is applied in the United States as a tool of national security. Due to its global influence, the United States is considered to be the world&#x27;s greatest target for intelligence operations. Terrorists, tyrants, foreign adversaries, and economic competitors have all been found to engage in &quot;a range of intelligence activities&quot; directed against the United States. Terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda have been found to employ intelligence practices similar to those of foreign powers, and American counterintelligence operations play a significant role in counterterrorism.

=== Covert action ===
In addition to intelligence gathering, the Central Intelligence Agency is authorized by the National Security Act of 1947 to engage in covert action. Covert action is undertaken to influence conditions in foreign countries without evidence of American involvement. This may include enacting propaganda campaigns, offering support to factions within a country, providing logistical assistance to foreign governments, or disrupting illegal activities. The use of covert action is controversial within the Intelligence Community due to the potential harm to foreign relations and public image, but most individuals involved in American intelligence cite it as an &quot;essential&quot; option to prevent terrorism, drug trafficking, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

==== Examples of covert involvement in regime change ====

United States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. According to J. Dana Stuster, writing in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, there are seven &quot;confirmed cases&quot; where the U.S.—acting principally through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), but sometimes with the support of other parts of the U.S. government, including the Navy and State Department—covertly assisted in the overthrow of a foreign government: Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Congo in 1960, the Dominican Republic in 1961, South Vietnam in 1963, Brazil in 1964, and Chile in 1973. Stuster states that this list excludes &quot;U.S.-supported insurgencies and failed assassination attempts&quot; such as those directed against Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, as well as instances where U.S. involvement has been alleged but not proven (such as Syria in 1949).

In 1953 the CIA, working with the British government, initiated &quot;Operation Ajax&quot; against the Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran&#x27;s oil, threatening the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This had the effect of restoring and strengthening the authoritarian monarchical reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1957, the CIA and Israeli Mossad aided the Iranian government in establishing its intelligence service, SAVAK, later blamed for the torture and execution of the regime&#x27;s opponents.

A year later, in &quot;Operation PBSuccess&quot;, the CIA assisted the local military in toppling the democratically elected left-wing government of Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala and installing the military dictator Carlos Castillo Armas. The United Fruit Company lobbied for Árbenz&#x27;s overthrow as his land reforms jeopardized their land holdings in Guatemala, and painted these reforms as a communist threat. The coup triggered a decades long civil war which claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 people (42,275 individual cases have been documented), mostly through 626 massacres against the Maya population perpetrated by the U.S.-backed Guatemalan military. An independent Historical Clarification Commission found that U.S. corporations and government officials &quot;exercised pressure to maintain the country&#x27;s archaic and unjust socio-economic structure&quot;, and that U.S. military assistance had a &quot;significant bearing on human rights violations during the armed confrontation&quot;.

During the massacre of at least 500,000 alleged communists in 1960s Indonesia, U.S. government officials encouraged and applauded the mass killings while providing covert assistance to the Indonesian military which helped facilitate them. This included the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta supplying Indonesian forces with lists of up to 5,000 names of suspected members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), who were subsequently killed in the massacres. In 2001, the CIA attempted to prevent the publication of the State Department volume &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968&quot;, which documents the U.S. role in providing covert assistance to the Indonesian military for the express purpose of the extirpation of the PKI. In July 2016, an international panel of judges ruled the killings constitute crimes against humanity, and that the US, along with other Western governments, were complicit in these crimes.

In 1970, the CIA worked with coup-plotters in Chile in the attempted kidnapping of General René Schneider, who was targeted for refusing to participate in a military coup upon the election of Salvador Allende. Schneider was shot in the botched attempt and died three days later. The CIA later paid the group $35,000 for the failed kidnapping.

According to one peer-reviewed study, the U.S. intervened in 81 foreign elections between 1946 and 2000.

The failed 1961 CIA Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba was an attempt by the U.S. government to overthrow a regime. Not only did this cause a diplomatic embarrassment, it also damaged the CIA&#x27;s credibility internationally.

== Public image ==

United States foreign policy has been the subject of debate, receiving praise and criticism domestically and abroad. As of 2019, public opinion in the United States is closely divided on American involvement in world affairs. 53% of Americans wish for the United States to be active in world affairs, while 46% of Americans wish for less involvement overseas. American involvement in the global economy is received more positively by the American people, with 73% considering it to be a &quot;good thing&quot;.

=== Global opinion ===
Overall, the United States is viewed positively by the rest of the world. The Eurasia Group Foundation reported that as of 2021, 85% of respondents from 10 countries have a favorable opinion of the United States and 81% favor American hegemony over Chinese hegemony. Those with an unfavorable view of the United States most commonly cited interventionism, and in particular the War in Afghanistan, as their reason. It was also found that the exercise of soft power increased favorable opinions while the exercise of hard power decreased favorable opinions. Citizens of Brazil, Nigeria, and India were found to have more favorable opinions of the United States, while citizens of China and Germany were found to have less favorable opinions of the United States.
International opinion about the US has often changed with different executive administrations. For example, in 2009, the French public favored the United States when President Barack Obama (75% favorable) replaced President George W. Bush (42%). After President Donald Trump took the helm in 2017, French public opinion about the US fell from 63% to 46%. These trends were also seen in other European countries.

Many democracies have voluntary military ties with the United States. See NATO, ANZUS, U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea, and Major non-NATO ally. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations. A 2013 global poll in 65 countries found that the United States is perceived as the biggest threat to world peace, with 24% of respondents identifying it as such. A majority of Russian respondents named the United States as the greatest threat, as well as significant minorities in China, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Argentina, Greece, Turkey, and Pakistan.

=== Foreign intervention ===

Empirical studies (see democide) have found that democracies, including the United States, inflict significantly fewer civilian casualties than dictatorships. Media may be biased against the U.S. regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that &quot;The New York Times&quot; coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations. For example, the bloodiest war in recent time, involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians, was the Second Congo War, which was almost completely ignored by the media.

Journalists and human rights organizations have been critical of US-led airstrikes and targeted killings by drones which have in some cases resulted in collateral damage of civilian populations. In early 2017, the U.S. faced criticism from some scholars, activists and media outlets for dropping 26,171 bombs on seven countries throughout 2016: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.

Research on the democratic peace theory has generally found that democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example Spencer R. Weart argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.

Critics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for Israel. Others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law. Critics have charged that the U.S. presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Critics also point to declassified records which indicate that the CIA under Allen Dulles and the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover aggressively recruited more than 1,000 Nazis, including those responsible for war crimes, to use as spies and informants against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.

Studies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations. Some scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been &quot;negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive&quot;. Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.

America&#x27;s history of non-intervention has been criticized as well. In his World Policy Journal review of Bill Kauffman&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;America First! Its History, Culture, and Politics&quot;, Benjamin Schwartz described America&#x27;s history of isolationism as a &quot;tragedy&quot; and being rooted in Puritan thinking.

Today the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S. national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, &quot;Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others. Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace, deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development, protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime, uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health.&quot; According to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, &quot;Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don&#x27;t attack each other.&quot; In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department, democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms. Leaked cables in 2010 suggested that the &quot;dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States&#x27; relations with the world&quot;.

The United States officially maintains that it supports democracy and human rights through several tools. Examples of these tools are as follows:

* A published yearly report by the State Department entitled &quot;Advancing Freedom and Democracy&quot;, issued in compliance with ADVANCE Democracy Act of 2007 (earlier the report was known as &quot;Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The U.S. Record&quot; and was issued in compliance with a 2002 law).
* A yearly published &quot;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&quot;.
* In 2006 (under President George W. Bush), the United States created a &quot;Human Rights Defenders Fund&quot; and &quot;Freedom Awards&quot;.
* The &quot;Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award&quot; recognizes the exceptional achievement of officers of foreign affairs agencies posted abroad.
* The &quot;Ambassadorial Roundtable Series&quot;, created in 2006, are informal discussions between newly confirmed U.S. Ambassadors and human rights and democracy non-governmental organizations.
* The National Endowment for Democracy, a private non-profit created by Congress in 1983 (and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan), which is mostly funded by the U.S. Government and gives cash grants to strengthen democratic institutions around the world.

=== Support for authoritarian governments ===

Both currently and historically, the United States has been willing to cooperate with authoritarian governments to pursue its geopolitical goals. The U.S. has faced criticism for backing right-wing dictators that systematically violated human rights, such as Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay, Efraín Ríos Montt of Guatemala, Jorge Rafael Videla of Argentina, Hissène Habré of Chad Yahya Khan of Pakistan and Suharto of Indonesia. Critics have also accused the United States of facilitating and supporting state terrorism in the Global South during the Cold War, such as Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terror organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America.

Regarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the Cold War, a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships. David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center (though not in South Korea), while the &#x27;realist&#x27; policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories. Some critical scholars and journalists, including Jason Hickel and Vincent Bevins, argue that the U.S. backed such dictators in order to reinforce Western business interests and to expand capitalism into countries of the Global South who were attempting to pursue alternative paths.

The U.S. has been accused of complicity in war crimes for backing the Saudi Arabian-led intervention into the Yemeni Civil War, which has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe, including a cholera outbreak and millions facing starvation.

Niall Ferguson argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all of the human rights violations perpetrated by U.S.-supported governments. Ferguson writes that there is general agreement that Guatemala was the worst of the U.S.-backed regimes during the Cold War, but the U.S. cannot be credibly blamed for all of the estimated 200,000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil War. The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services.

=== Human rights ===
Since the 1970s, issues of human rights have become increasingly important in American foreign policy. Congress took the lead in the 1970s. Following the Vietnam War, the feeling that U.S. foreign policy had grown apart from traditional American values was seized upon by Representative Donald M. Fraser (D, MN), leading the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements, in criticizing Republican Foreign Policy under the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, Congress concluded the Vietnam War and passed the War Powers Act. As &quot;part of a growing assertiveness by Congress about many aspects of Foreign Policy&quot;, human rights concerns became a battleground between the Legislative and the Executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy. David Forsythe points to three specific, early examples of Congress interjecting its own thoughts on foreign policy:

# Subsection (a) of the International Financial Assistance Act of 1977: ensured assistance through international financial institutions would be limited to countries &quot;other than those whose governments engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights&quot;.
# Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in 1984: reads in part, &quot;No assistance may be provided under this part to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.&quot;
# Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in 1978: &quot;No security assistance may be provided to any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.&quot;
These measures were repeatedly used by Congress, with varying success, to affect U.S. foreign policy towards the inclusion of Human Rights concerns. Specific examples include El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and South Africa. The Executive (from Nixon to Reagan) argued that the Cold War required placing regional security in favor of U.S. interests over any behavioral concerns of national allies. Congress argued the opposite, in favor of distancing the United States from oppressive regimes. Nevertheless, according to historian Daniel Goldhagen, during the last two decades of the Cold War, the number of American client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the Soviet Union. John Henry Coatsworth, a historian of Latin America and the provost of Columbia University, suggests the number of repression victims in Latin America alone far surpassed that of the USSR and its East European satellites during the period 1960 to 1990. W. John Green contends that the United States was an &quot;essential enabler&quot; of &quot;Latin America&#x27;s political murder habit, bringing out and allowing to flourish some of the region&#x27;s worst tendencies&quot;.

On December 6, 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. He also criticized Russia&#x27;s law discriminating against gays, joining other western leaders in the boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia.

In June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that the United States played a key role in the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, both American citizens, shortly after the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état.

<text>Christmas in Poland, known in the Polish language as Boże Narodzenie (God&#x27;s Birth) or Gwiazdka (Little Star), is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Christian world. The observance of Christmas in Poland developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old Polish pagan customs with the religious practice introduced after the Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church. Later influences include the mutual permeating of local traditions, lore, and folk culture. It is one of the most important religious holidays for Poles, who follow strict traditional customs, some of which are not found elsewhere in Europe.

The Day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December is the unofficial beginning of the festive season in Poland. Well-behaved children receive small gifts on the day, whereas naughty children receive a lump of coal or a &quot;rózga&quot; twig. The highlight of the holiday is Christmas Eve on 24 December; Christmas trees are traditionally decorated and lit in family rooms on the morning of Christmas Eve. The Polish Wigilia supper begins with the appearance of the first star, which corresponds to the Star of Bethlehem. During preparation, hay is spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Jesus Christ was born in a manger. An empty place setting is left symbolically at the table for the Lord or lost wanderer. The supper begins with the breaking of the Christmas wafer (&quot;opłatek&quot;). The meals must be vegetarian (with the exception of fish) as a sign of fasting and twelve different dishes are prepared, thus symbolizing the Twelve Apostles. The celebration ends with the exchange of presents and a midnight mass in churches.

Other aspects of Polish Christmas include nativity plays called &quot;Jasełka&quot; or &quot;Herody&quot;, outdoor nativity scenes, the singing of carols, notably &quot;God Is Born&quot; or &quot;Midst Quiet Night&quot;, and Kulig, a horse-pulled sleigh ride. The tradition of crafting and hand-making Christmas szopkas in Kraków was declared UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

==Advent==
Among the special tasks carried out in private homes during Advent (a time of waiting for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus) is the baking of the Christmas piernik (gingerbread), and the making of Christmas decorations. Pierniks are made in a variety of shapes, including hearts, animals, and St. Nicholas figures. St. Nicholas does not play a major role on Christmas Day, but is celebrated on his Saint feast day of December 6. He visits good children in secret and leaves presents for them.

Traditionally, the Christmas trees are decorated with glass baubles, garlands and many homemade ornaments including painted eggshells, shiny red apples, walnuts, wrapped chocolate shapes, candles, etc. They are lit on Christmas Eve before Wigilia. At the top of each tree there is a star or a glittering tree topper. In many homes, sparklers are hung on the branches of the trees for wintery ambiance. Sometimes the trees are left standing until February 2, the feast day of St. Mary of the Candle of Lighting.

During Advent and all the way until Epiphany, or the baptism of Jesus (day of January 6), the &quot;gwiazdory&quot;, or the star carriers walk through the villages. Some of them sing carols; others recite verses or put on &quot;szopki&quot;, or &quot;herody&quot; (nativity scenes). The last two customs are inspired by the traditional manger scenes or &quot;Jasełka&quot; (crib). One tradition unique to Poland is the sharing of the &quot;opłatek&quot;, a thin wafer into which a holy picture is pressed. In the old days, people carried these wafers from house to house wishing their neighbors a Merry Christmas. Nowadays, opłatek is mostly shared with members of the family and immediate neighbors before the Christmas Eve supper (Wigilia in the Polish language). As each person shares pieces of the wafer with another, they are supposed to forgive each other any hurts that have occurred over the past year and wish them happiness in the coming year.

==&quot;Wigilia&quot;, the Christmas Eve supper==
In Poland, Christmas Eve is a day first of fasting, then of feasting. The Wigilia feast begins at the appearance of the first star. There is no red meat served but fish, usually carp. The supper, which includes many traditional dishes and desserts can sometimes last for over two hours. It is followed by the exchange of gifts. The next day, the Christmas Day, is often spent visiting friends. In Polish tradition, people combine religion and family closeness at Christmas. Although gift-giving plays a major role in the rituals, the emphasis is placed more on the making of special foods and decorations.

On the night of Christmas Eve, so important is the appearance of the first star in remembrance of the Star of Bethlehem, that it has been given an affectionate name of &quot;the little star&quot; or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, &quot;The star has come!&quot; Only after it appears, the family members sit down to a dinner table.

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a manger. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the tablecloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table. In many homes an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the Baby Jesus or, for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, or if a deceased relative should come and would like to share in the meal.

The supper begins with the breaking of the opłatek wafer. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the Twelve Apostles, or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine).

A traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried carp and borscht (beetroot soup) or mushroom consommé with uszka (tortellini). Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; carp fillet, carp in aspic and gefilte fish. Universal Polish Christmas foods are pierogi as well as some herring dishes, and for dessert, makowiec or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a compote of dry fruits for a drink.

The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that &quot;The Little Star&quot; brings gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with &quot;Pasterka&quot;, the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the shepherds to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the newborn Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity. The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. According to scripture, the Christmas Day masses are interchangeable allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners.

==&quot;Kolędy&quot;, the Christmas carols==

Christmas carols are not celebrated in Poland until during-and-after the Christmas Vigil Mass called &quot;Pasterka&quot; held between 24 and 25 of December. The Christmas season often runs until February 2. The early hymns sung in the Catholic church were brought to Poland by the Franciscan Brothers in the Middle Ages. The early Christmas music was Latin in origin. When the Polish words and melodies started to become popular, including many new secular pastorals (, or shepherd&#x27;s songs), they were not written down originally, but rather taught among people by heart. Notably, the song &quot;God Is Born&quot; (&quot;Bóg się rodzi&quot;) with lyrics written by Franciszek Karpiński in 1792 became the Christmas hymn of Poland already in the court of King Stefan Batory. Many of the early Polish carols were collected in 1838 by in a book called &quot;Pastorałki i Kolędy z Melodiami&quot; (Pastorals and Carols with Melodies), including &quot;Midst Quiet Night&quot;.

==Polish hand-made Christmas ornaments==

Poland produces some of the finest hand blown glass Christmas ornaments in Europe. Families and collectors value these ornaments for high quality, traditional artwork, and unique decorations.

Polish blown-glass Christmas ornaments are generally manufactured only in the winter season. The modern glass workshops and manufacturers tend to be localized in the southern regions of Poland.
