<text>Chris Cunningham (born 15 October 1970) is a British video artist and music video director who directed music videos for electronic musicians such as Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin and Björk. Early in his career he worked as a comic book artist. He has created art installations and directed short movies. In the mid 2000s, Cunningham began doing music production work, and has also designed album artwork for a variety of musicians. Cunningham worked on a never completed movie adaptation of William Gibson&#x27;s cyberpunk novel &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;

His style is noted for its use of robotics, body horror and Mickey mousing (syncing action with music).

== Biography ==

=== Early work - comic books and film special effects ===
Between circa 1990 and 1992, he worked as a comic book artist for 2000 AD working under the pseudonym &quot;Chris Halls&quot; (Halls is his stepfather&#x27;s surname). He worked on comics including &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine.&quot; His contributions included cover paintings and strips&quot;.&quot;

Also from around 1990, he worked on films including model-making, prosthetic make-up and concept illustrations. He worked on films including &quot;Hardware&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dust Devil&quot; (1992) for Richard Stanley, &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (1990) for Clive Barker, and &quot;Alien3&quot; (1992) for David Fincher.

After seeing Cunningham&#x27;s work on the 1995 film version of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, Stanley Kubrick head-hunted Cunningham to work on &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;. For Kubrick, Cunningham designed and supervised animatronic prototypes of David; the central robot child character. Cunningham worked for over a year on the film. However, around this time Kubrick put the film on hold, with Cunningham going on to pursue a career as a director.

=== Music videos ===
Cunningham has had close ties to Warp Records since his first video for Autechre, &quot;Second Bad Vilbel&quot; in 1995 and Squarepusher&#x27;s &quot;Come On My Selector&quot; in 1998, which received airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Amp&quot; and MTV&#x27;s Chill Out Zone in Europe. Videos for Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; and &quot;Windowlicker&quot; are perhaps his best known. His video for Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; won multiple awards, including an MTV music video award for Breakthrough Video and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. It was also the first ever music video to win a Gold Pencil at the D&amp;AD Awards. It can still be seen at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His video for Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Windowlicker&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Best Video&quot; award at the Brit Awards 2000. He also directed Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Frozen&quot; video which became an international hit and won the award for Best Special Effects at the 1998 MTV Music Video Awards. Cunningham also came out of a seven-year hiatus from making music videos to direct the video for &quot;Sheena Is a Parasite&quot; by the Horrors.

=== Video art ===
His video installation &quot;Flex&quot; was first shown in 2000 at the Royal Academy of Arts, and subsequently at the Anthony d&#x27;Offay Gallery and other art galleries. &quot;Flex&quot; was commissioned by the Anthony d&#x27;Offay Gallery for the exhibition curated by Norman Rosenthal and Max Wigram at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2000.

The Anthony d&#x27;Offay Gallery also commissioned &quot;Monkey Drummer&quot;, a 2½ minute piece intended for exhibition as a companion to &quot;Flex&quot; at the 2000 &quot;Apocalypse&quot; exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts: however, the piece was not finished in time. In it an automaton with nine appendages and the head of a monkey plays the drums to &quot;Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount&quot;, the 10th track on Aphex Twin&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;drukqs&quot;. &quot;Monkey Drummer&quot; debuted as part of Cunningham&#x27;s installation at the 49th International Exhibition of Art at the 2001 Venice Biennale, which consisted of a loop of &quot;Monkey Drummer&quot;, &quot;Flex&quot;, and his video for Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;. In 2002 both &quot;Flex&quot; and &quot;Monkey Drummer&quot; were exhibited by 5th Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, in an exhibition curated by Artist/Curator Paul Murnaghan,

=== &quot;Neuromancer&quot; ===
In an August 1999 &quot;Spike Magazine&quot; interview, cyberpunk author William Gibson stated &quot;He (Chris) was brought to my attention by someone else. We were told, third-hand, that he was extremely wary of the Hollywood process, and wouldn&#x27;t return calls. But someone else told us that &quot;Neuromancer&quot; had been his &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, that he&#x27;d read it when he was a kid. I went to London and we met.&quot; Gibson is also quoted in the article as saying &quot;Chris is my own 100 percent personal choice...My only choice. The only person I&#x27;ve met who I thought might have a hope in hell of doing it right. I went back to see him in London just after he&#x27;d finished the Bjork video, and I sat on a couch beside this dead sex little Bjork robot, except it was wearing Aphex Twin&#x27;s head. We talked.&quot;

In 2000, Cunningham and William Gibson began work on the script for Gibson&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. However, because &quot;Neuromancer&quot; was due to be a big budget studio film, it is rumoured that Cunningham pulled out due to being a first time director without final cut approval. He also felt that too much of the original book&#x27;s ideas had been cannibalised by other recent films.

=== Music production, &#x27;live&#x27; and short films (2004 - present) ===
By 18 November 2004, the Neuromancer film project had been canned. On the FAQ on the William Gibson Board, Gibson stated about the adaptation &quot;... The most recently rumoured version, to have been directed by Chris Cunningham, is now definitely not happening.&quot;

Cunningham took a sabbatical from filmmaking to learn about music production and recording and to develop his own music projects.

In 2005, Cunningham released the short film &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; as a DVD accompanied by a book of photographs and drawings. &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot;, a six-minute experimental short film cut to a soundtrack by Aphex Twin remixed by Cunningham, was shot between 2001 and 2004. Shot on DV night-vision, it was made in Cunningham&#x27;s own time as a home movie of sorts, and took three and half years of weekends to complete. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;like a Looney Tunes short for a generation raised on video nasties and rave music&quot;.

In 2005, Cunningham played a 45-minute audio visual piece performed live in Tokyo and Osaka in front of 30,000+ fans over the two nights at the Japanese electronic music festival . These performances evolved into &quot;Chris Cunningham Live&quot;, a 55-minute long performance piece combining original and remixed music and film. It features remixed, unreleased and brand new videos and music dynamically edited together into a new live piece spread over three screens. The sound accompanying these images includes Cunningham&#x27;s first publicly performed compositions interspersed with his remixes of other artist&#x27;s work. &quot;Chris Cunningham Live&quot; debuted as one of the headline attractions at Warp 20 in Paris on 8 May 2009 with other performances scheduled at festivals in UK, and a number of European cities later in the year. &quot;Chris Cunningham Live&quot; continued in June 2011, with performances in London, Barcelona, and Sydney, Australia.

During this period Cunningham also made another short film for Warp Films, &quot;Spectral Musicians&quot;, which remains unreleased. The short film was set to Squarepusher&#x27;s &quot;My Fucking Sound&quot; from his album &quot;Go Plastic&quot;; and to a piece called &quot;Mutilation Colony&quot; which was written especially for the short, and was released on the studio album &quot;Do You Know Squarepusher&quot;.

In 2007, an excerpt from &quot;Flex&quot; was shown in the Barbican&#x27;s exhibition Seduced: Art and Sex from Antiquity to Now curated by Martin Kemp, Marina Wallace and Joanne Bernstein. alongside other pieces by Bacon, Klimt, Rembrandt, Rodin and Picasso.

In December 2007 Cunningham produced two tracks, &quot;Three Decades&quot; and &quot;Primary Colours&quot;, for &quot;Primary Colours&quot;, the second album by the Horrors. In the summer of 2008, due to scheduling conflicts with his feature film script writing he could not work on the rest of the album which was subsequently recorded by Geoff Barrow from Portishead.

In 2008, he produced and arranged a new version of &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27; for the Gucci commercial that he also directed. He travelled to Nashville to work with Donna Summer to record a brand new vocal for it.

In 2008, Cunningham produced a fashion shoot for &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; using Grace Jones as a model to create &quot;Nubian versions&quot; of Rubber Johnny. In an interview for BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot;, it was suggested that the collaboration may expand into a video project. In regards to the collaboration, Cunningham stated &quot;For me, Grace has the strongest iconography of any artist in music. She’s definitely the most inspiring person I’ve worked with so far&quot;.

In November 2008, Cunningham followed on with another photoshoot for &quot;Vice Magazine&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cunningham was married to Warpaint&#x27;s bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg in 2010. By 2016, they were currently no longer together.

==Photography==
Cunningham has created photography and cover artwork for various people including Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Windowlicker&quot; and &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;.

== Videography ==
Cunningham has directed music videos, commercials and short films. His commercials for companies and brands, include Gucci, Sony (PlayStation), Levi&#x27;s, Telecom Italia, Nissan, and Orange.

<doc id="7401" wikidata="Q83203" url="?curid=7401" title="Centaur">
<text>A centaur ( ; ; ), occasionally hippocentaur, also called Ixionidae (), is a creature from Greek mythology with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse that was said to live in the mountains of Thessaly. In one version of the myth, the centaurs were named after Centaurus, and, through his brother Lapithes, were kin to the legendary tribe of the Lapiths.

Centaurs are thought of in many Greek myths as being as wild as untamed horses, and were said to have inhabited the region of Magnesia and Mount Pelion in Thessaly, the Foloi oak forest in Elis, and the Malean peninsula in southern Laconia. Centaurs are subsequently featured in Roman mythology, and were familiar figures in the medieval bestiary. They remain a staple of modern fantastic literature.

== Etymology ==
The Greek word &quot;kentauros&quot; is generally regarded as being of obscure origin. The etymology from &quot;ken&quot; + &quot;tauros&quot;, &#x27;piercing bull&#x27;, was a euhemerist suggestion in Palaephatus&#x27; rationalizing text on Greek mythology, &quot;On Incredible Tales&quot; (Περὶ ἀπίστων), which included mounted archers from a village called &quot;Nephele&quot; eliminating a herd of bulls that were the scourge of Ixion&#x27;s kingdom. Another possible related etymology can be &quot;bull-slayer&quot;.

==Mythology==
===Creation of centaurs===
The centaurs were usually said to have been born of Ixion and Nephele. As the story goes, Nephele was a cloud made into the likeness of Hera in a plot to trick Ixion into revealing his lust for Hera to Zeus. Ixion seduced Nephele and from that relationship centaurs were created. Another version, however, makes them children of Centaurus, a man who mated with the Magnesian mares. Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of Apollo and the nymph Stilbe. In the latter version of the story, Centaurus&#x27;s twin brother was Lapithes, ancestor of the Lapiths.

Another tribe of centaurs was said to have lived on Cyprus. According to Nonnus, the Cyprian Centaurs were fathered by Zeus, who, in frustration after Aphrodite had eluded him, spilled his seed on the ground of that land. Unlike those of mainland Greece, the Cyprian centaurs were ox-horned.

There were also the Lamian Pheres, twelve rustic daimones (spirits) of the Lamos river. They were set by Zeus to guard the infant Dionysos, protecting him from the machinations of Hera, but the enraged goddess transformed them into ox-horned Centaurs unrelated to the Cyprian Centaurs. The Lamian Pheres later accompanied Dionysos in his campaign against the Indians.

The centaur&#x27;s half-human, half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as liminal beings, caught between the two natures they embody in contrasting myths; they are both the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the Lapiths (their kin), and conversely, teachers like Chiron.

===Centauromachy===
The Centaurs are best known for their fight with the Lapiths who, according to one origin myth, would have been cousins to the centaurs. The battle, called the Centauromachy, was caused by the centaurs&#x27; attempt to carry off Hippodamia and the rest of the Lapith women on the day of Hippodamia&#x27;s marriage to Pirithous, who was the king of the Lapithae and a son of Ixion. Theseus, a hero and founder of cities, who happened to be present, threw the balance in favour of the Lapiths by assisting Pirithous in the battle. The Centaurs were driven off or destroyed. Another Lapith hero, Caeneus, who was invulnerable to weapons, was beaten into the earth by Centaurs wielding rocks and the branches of trees. In her article &quot;The Centaur: Its History and Meaning in Human Culture&quot;, Elizabeth Lawrence claims that the contests between the centaurs and the Lapiths typify the struggle between civilization and barbarism.

The Centauromachy is most famously portrayed in the metopes of the Parthenon by Phidias and in the &quot;Battle of the Centaurs&quot;, a relief by Michelangelo.

==Origin of the myth==
The most common theory holds that the idea of centaurs came from the first reaction of a non-riding culture, as in the Minoan Aegean world, to nomads who were mounted on horses. The theory suggests that such riders would appear as half-man, half-animal. Bernal Díaz del Castillo reported that the Aztecs also had this misapprehension about Spanish cavalrymen. The Lapith tribe of Thessaly, who were the kinsmen of the Centaurs in myth, were described as the inventors of horse-riding by Greek writers. The Thessalian tribes also claimed their horse breeds were descended from the centaurs.

Robert Graves (relying on the work of Georges Dumézil, who argued for tracing the centaurs back to the Indian Gandharva), speculated that the centaurs were a dimly remembered, pre-Hellenic fraternal earth cult who had the horse as a totem. A similar theory was incorporated into Mary Renault&#x27;s &quot;The Bull from the Sea.&quot;

==Variations==
===Female centaurs===
Though female centaurs, called centaurides or centauresses, are not mentioned in early Greek literature and art, they do appear occasionally in later antiquity. A Macedonian mosaic of the 4th century BC is one of the earliest examples of the centauress in art. Ovid also mentions a centauress named Hylonome who committed suicide when her husband Cyllarus was killed in the war with the Lapiths.
===India===
The Kalibangan cylinder seal, dated to be around 2600–1900 BC, found at the site of Indus-Valley civilization shows a battle between men in the presence of centaur-like creatures. Other sources claim the creatures represented are actually half human and half tigers, later evolving into the Hindu Goddess of War. These seals are also evidence of Indus-Mesopotamia relations in the 3rd millennium BC.

In a popular legend associated with Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, the curse of a saintly Brahmin transformed a handsome Yadava prince into a creature having a horse&#x27;s body and the prince&#x27;s head, arms, and torso in place of the head and neck of the horse.

Kinnaras, another half-man, half-horse mythical creature from Indian mythology, appeared in various ancient texts, arts, and sculptures from all around India. It is shown as a horse with the torso of a man where the horse&#x27;s head would be, and is similar to a Greek centaur.

===Russia===
A centaur-like half-human, half-equine creature called &quot;Polkan&quot; appeared in Russian folk art and lubok prints of the 17th–19th centuries. Polkan is originally based on &quot;Pulicane&quot;, a half-dog from Andrea da Barberino&#x27;s poem &quot;I Reali di Francia&quot;, which was once popular in the Slavonic world in prosaic translations.

==Artistic representations==

===Classical art===

The extensive Mycenaean pottery found at Ugarit included two fragmentary Mycenaean terracotta figures which have been tentatively identified as centaurs. This finding suggests a Bronze Age origin for these creatures of myth. A painted terracotta centaur was found in the &quot;Hero&#x27;s tomb&quot; at Lefkandi, and by the Geometric period, centaurs figure among the first representational figures painted on Greek pottery. An often-published Geometric period bronze of a warrior face-to-face with a centaur is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In Greek art of the Archaic period, centaurs are depicted in three different forms.

* Some centaurs are depicted with a human torso attached to the body of a horse at the withers, where the horse&#x27;s neck would be; this form, designated &quot;Class A&quot; by Professor Paul Baur, later became standard.
* &quot;Class B&quot; centaurs are depicted with a human body and legs joined at the waist to the hindquarters of a horse; in some cases centaurs of both Class A and Class B appear together.
* A third type, designated &quot;Class C&quot;, depicts centaurs with human forelegs terminating in hooves. Baur describes this as an apparent development of Aeolic art, which never became particularly widespread.

There are also paintings and motifs on &quot;amphorae&quot; and Dipylon cups which depict winged centaurs.

Centaurs were also frequently depicted in Roman art. One example is the pair of centaurs drawing the chariot of Constantine the Great and his family in the Great Cameo of Constantine (&quot;circa&quot; AD 314–16), which embodies wholly pagan imagery, and contrasts sharply with the popular image of Constantine as the patron of early Christianity.

===Medieval art===

Centaurs preserved a Dionysian connection in the 12th-century Romanesque carved capitals of Mozac Abbey in the Auvergne. Other similar capitals depict harvesters, boys riding goats (a further Dionysiac theme), and griffins guarding the chalice that held the wine. Centaurs are also shown on a number of Pictish carved stones from north-east Scotland erected in the 8th–9th centuries AD (e.g., at Meigle, Perthshire). Though outside the limits of the Roman Empire, these depictions appear to be derived from Classical prototypes.

===Modern art===
The John C. Hodges library at The University of Tennessee hosts a permanent exhibit of a &quot;Centaur from Volos&quot; in its library. The exhibit, made by sculptor Bill Willers by combining a study human skeleton with the skeleton of a Shetland pony, is entitled &quot;Do you believe in Centaurs?&quot;. According to the exhibitors, it was meant to mislead students in order to make them more critically aware.

===Cartography===
Depictions of centaurs in a mythical land located south beyond the world&#x27;s known continents appear on a map by Urbano Monti from 1587, sometimes called Monti&#x27;s Planisphere.

===In heraldry===
Centaurs are common in European heraldry, although more frequent in continental than in British arms. A centaur holding a bow is referred to as a sagittarius.

==Literature==
===Classical literature===

Jerome&#x27;s version of the &quot;Life&quot; of St Anthony the Great, written by Athanasius of Alexandria about the hermit monk of Egypt, was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages; it relates Anthony&#x27;s encounter with a centaur who challenged the saint, but was forced to admit that the old gods had been overthrown. The episode was often depicted in &quot;The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit&quot; by the painter Stefano di Giovanni, who was known as &quot;Sassetta&quot;. Of the two episodic depictions of the hermit Anthony&#x27;s travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter with the demonic figure of a centaur along the pathway in a wood.

Lucretius, in his first-century BC philosophical poem &quot;On the Nature of Things,&quot; denied the existence of centaurs, based on the differing rates of growth of human and equine anatomies. Specifically, he states that at the age of three years, horses are in the prime of their life while humans at the same age are still little more than babies, making hybrid animals impossible.

===Medieval literature===
Centaurs are among the creatures which 14th-century Italian poet Dante placed as guardians in his &quot;Inferno&quot;. In Canto XII, Dante and his guide Virgil meet a band led by Chiron and Pholus, guarding the bank of Phlegethon in the seventh circle of Hell, a river of boiling blood in which the violent against their neighbours are immersed, shooting arrows into any who move to a shallower spot than their allotted station. The two poets are treated with courtesy, and Nessus guides them to a ford. In Canto XXIV, in the eighth circle, in Bolgia 7, a ditch where thieves are confined, they meet but do not converse with Cacus (who is a giant in the ancient sources), wreathed in serpents and with a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders, arriving to punish a sinner who has just cursed God. In his &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, an unseen spirit on the sixth terrace cites the centaurs (&quot;the drunken double-breasted ones who fought Theseus&quot;) as examples of the sin of gluttony.

===Modern day literature===
C.S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series depicts centaurs as the wisest and noblest of creatures. Narnian Centaurs are gifted at stargazing, prophecy, healing, and warfare; a fierce and valiant race always faithful to the High King Aslan the Lion.

In J.K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, centaurs live in the Forbidden Forest close to Hogwarts, preferring to avoid contact with humans. They live in societies called herds and are skilled at archery, healing, and astrology, but like in the original myths, they are known to have some wild and barbarous tendencies.

With the exception of Chiron, the centaurs in Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; are seen as wild party-goers who use a lot of American slang. Chiron retains his mythological role as a trainer of heroes and is skilled in archery. In Riordan&#x27;s subsequent series, &quot;Heroes of Olympus&quot;, another group of centaurs are depicted with more animalistic features (such as horns) and appear as villains, serving the Gigantes.

Philip Jose Farmer&#x27;s &quot;World of Tiers&quot; series (1965) includes centaurs, called Half-Horses or Hoi Kentauroi. His creations address several of the metabolic problems of such creatures—how could the human mouth and nose intake sufficient air to sustain both itself and the horse body and, similarly, how could the human ingest sufficient food to sustain both parts.

Brandon Mull&#x27;s &quot;Fablehaven&quot; series features centaurs that live in an area called Grunhold. The centaurs are portrayed as a proud, elitist group of beings that consider themselves superior to all other creatures. The fourth book also has a variation on the species called an Alcetaur, which is part man, part moose.

The myth of the centaur appears in John Updike&#x27;s novel &quot;The Centaur&quot;. The author depicts a rural Pennsylvanian town as seen through the optics of the myth of the centaur. An unknown and marginalized local school teacher, just like the mythological Chiron did for Prometheus, gave up his life for the future of his son who had chosen to be an independent artist in New York.

Other hybrid creatures appear in Greek mythology, always with some liminal connection that links Hellenic culture with archaic or non-Hellenic cultures:
* Furietti Centaurs
* Hippocamp
* Hybrid (mythology)
* Ipotane - Another half-human half-horse creature.
* Legendary creature
* Lists of legendary creatures
* Minotaur
* Onocentaur - A type of centaur that is part-donkey.
* Ichthyocentaur - A type of aquatic centaur with a fish tail instead of hindquarters.
* Sagittarius
* Satyr

Also,
* Hindu Kamadhenu
* Indian Kinnara which are half-horse and half-man creatures.
* Islamic Buraq, a heavenly steed often portrayed as an equine being with a human face. 
* Philippine Tikbalang
* Roman Faun, and the Hippopodes of Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, and later authors.
* Scottish Each uisge and Nuckelavee
* Welsh Ceffyl Dŵr

Additionally, &quot;Bucentaur&quot;, the name of several historically important Venetian vessels, was linked to a posited ox-centaur or &quot;βουκένταυρος&quot; &quot;(boukentauros)&quot; by fanciful and likely spurious folk-etymology.

<doc id="7403" wikidata="Q658145" url="?curid=7403" title="Chemotaxis">
<text>Chemotaxis (from &quot;chemo-&quot; + &quot;taxis&quot;) is the movement of an organism or entity in response to a chemical stimulus. Somatic cells, bacteria, and other single-cell or multicellular organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., glucose) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons (e.g., phenol). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g., movement of sperm towards the egg during fertilization) and development (e.g., migration of neurons or lymphocytes) as well as in normal function and health (e.g., migration of leukocytes during injury or infection). In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during cancer metastasis, and the aberrant change of the overall property of these networks, which control chemotaxis, can lead to carcinogenesis. The aberrant chemotaxis of leukocytes and lymphocytes also contribute to inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, asthma, and arthritis. Sub-cellular components, such as the polarity patch generated by mating yeast, may also display chemotactic behavior.

&quot;Positive&quot; chemotaxis occurs if the movement is toward a higher concentration of the chemical in question; &quot;negative&quot; chemotaxis if the movement is in the opposite direction. Chemically prompted kinesis (randomly directed or nondirectional) can be called chemokinesis.

== History of chemotaxis research ==

Although migration of cells was detected from the early days of the development of microscopy by Leeuwenhoek, a Caltech lecture regarding chemotaxis propounds that &#x27;erudite description of chemotaxis was only first made by T. W. Engelmann (1881) and W. F. Pfeffer (1884) in bacteria, and H. S. Jennings (1906) in ciliates&#x27;. The Nobel Prize laureate I. Metchnikoff also contributed to the study of the field during 1882 to 1886, with investigations of the process as an initial step of phagocytosis. The significance of chemotaxis in biology and clinical pathology was widely accepted in the 1930s, and the most fundamental definitions underlying the phenomenon were drafted by this time. The most important aspects in quality control of chemotaxis assays were described by H. Harris in the 1950s. In the 1960s and 1970s, the revolution of modern cell biology and biochemistry provided a series of novel techniques that became available to investigate the migratory responder cells and subcellular fractions responsible for chemotactic activity. The availability of this technology led to the discovery of C5a, a major chemotactic factor involved in acute inflammation. The pioneering works of J. Adler modernized Pfeffer&#x27;s capillary assay and represented a significant turning point in understanding the whole process of intracellular signal transduction of bacteria.

== Bacterial chemotaxis—general characteristics ==

Some bacteria, such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, have several flagella per cell (4–10 typically). These can rotate in two ways:
# Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line; and
# Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.

=== Behavior ===
The overall movement of a bacterium is the result of alternating tumble and swim phases, called run-and-tumble motion. As a result, the trajectory of a bacterium swimming in a uniform environment will form a random walk with relatively straight swims interrupted by random tumbles that reorient the bacterium. Bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; are unable to choose the direction in which they swim, and are unable to swim in a straight line for more than a few seconds due to rotational diffusion; in other words, bacteria &quot;forget&quot; the direction in which they are going. By repeatedly evaluating their course, and adjusting if they are moving in the wrong direction, bacteria can direct their random walk motion toward favorable locations.

In the presence of a chemical gradient bacteria will chemotax, or direct their overall motion based on the gradient. If the bacterium senses that it is moving in the correct direction (toward attractant/away from repellent), it will keep swimming in a straight line for a longer time before tumbling; however, if it is moving in the wrong direction, it will tumble sooner. Bacteria like &quot;E. coli&quot; use temporal sensing to decide whether their situation is improving or not, and in this way, find the location with the highest concentration of attractant, detecting even small differences in concentration.

This biased random walk is a result of simply choosing between two methods of random movement; namely tumbling and straight swimming. The helical nature of the individual flagellar filament is critical for this movement to occur. The protein structure that makes up the flagellar filament, flagellin, is conserved among all flagellated bacteria. Vertebrates seem to have taken advantage of this fact by possessing an immune receptor (TLR5) designed to recognize this conserved protein.

As in many instances in biology, there are bacteria that do not follow this rule. Many bacteria, such as &quot;Vibrio&quot;, are monoflagellated and have a single flagellum at one pole of the cell. Their method of chemotaxis is different. Others possess a single flagellum that is kept inside the cell wall. These bacteria move by spinning the whole cell, which is shaped like a corkscrew.

===Signal transduction===

Chemical gradients are sensed through multiple transmembrane receptors, called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which vary in the molecules that they detect. Thousands of MCP receptors are known to be encoded across the bacterial kingdom. These receptors may bind attractants or repellents directly or indirectly through interaction with proteins of periplasmatic space. The signals from these receptors are transmitted across the plasma membrane into the cytosol, where &quot;Che proteins&quot; are activated. The Che proteins alter the tumbling frequency, and alter the receptors.

====Flagellum regulation====
The proteins CheW and CheA bind to the receptor. The absence of receptor activation results in autophosphorylation in the histidine kinase, CheA, at a single highly conserved histidine residue. CheA, in turn, transfers phosphoryl groups to conserved aspartate residues in the response regulators CheB and CheY; CheA is a histidine kinase and it does not actively transfer the phosphoryl group, rather, the response regulator CheB takes the phosphoryl group from CheA. This mechanism of signal transduction is called a two-component system, and it is a common form of signal transduction in bacteria. CheY induces tumbling by interacting with the flagellar switch protein FliM, inducing a change from counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation of the flagellum. Change in the rotation state of a single flagellum can disrupt the entire flagella bundle and cause a tumble.

====Receptor regulation====

CheB, when activated by CheA, acts as a methylesterase, removing methyl groups from glutamate residues on the cytosolic side of the receptor; it works antagonistically with CheR, a methyltransferase, which adds methyl residues to the same glutamate residues. If the level of an attractant remains high, the level of phosphorylation of CheA (and, therefore, CheY and CheB) will remain low, the cell will swim smoothly, and the level of methylation of the MCPs will increase (because CheB-P is not present to demethylate). The MCPs no longer respond to the attractant when they are fully methylated; therefore, even though the level of attractant might remain high, the level of CheA-P (and CheB-P) increases and the cell begins to tumble. The MCPs can be demethylated by CheB-P, and, when this happens, the receptors can once again respond to attractants. The situation is the opposite with regard to repellents: fully methylated MCPs respond best to repellents, while least-methylated MCPs respond worst to repellents. This regulation allows the bacterium to &#x27;remember&#x27; chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus &#x27;know&#x27; whether it is traveling up or down a gradient.
 that bacteria have to chemical gradients, other mechanisms are involved in increasing the absolute value of the sensitivity on a given background. Well-established examples are the ultra-sensitive response of the motor to the CheY-P signal, and the clustering of chemoreceptors.

== Chemoattractants and chemorepellents ==
Chemoattractants and chemorepellents are inorganic or organic substances possessing chemotaxis-inducer effect in motile cells. These chemotactic ligands create chemical concentration gradients that organisms, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, move toward or away from, respectively.

Effects of chemoattractants are elicited via chemoreceptors such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP). MCPs in E.coli include Tar, Tsr, Trg and Tap. Chemoattracttants to Trg include ribose and galactose with phenol as a chemorepellent. Tap and Tsr recognize dipeptides and serine as chemoattractants, respectively.

Chemoattractants or chemorepellents bind MCPs at its extracellular domain; an intracellular signaling domain relays the changes in concentration of these chemotactic ligands to downstream proteins like that of CheA which then relays this signal to flagellar motors via phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P). CheY-P can then control flagellar rotation influencing the direction of cell motility.

For &quot;E.coli&quot;, &quot;S. meliloti&quot;, and &quot;R. spheroides,&quot; the binding of chemoattractants to MCPs inhibit CheA and therefore CheY-P activity, resulting in smooth runs, but for &quot;B. substilis&quot;, CheA activity increases. Methylation events in &quot;E.coli&quot; cause MCPs to have lower affinity to chemoattractants which causes increased activity of CheA and CheY-P resulting in tumbles. In this way cells are able to adapt to the immediate chemoattractant concentration and detect further changes to modulate cell motility.

Chemoattractants in eukaryotes are well characterized for immune cells. Formyl peptides, such as fMLF, attract leukocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, causing movement toward infection sites. Non-acylated methioninyl peptides do not act as chemoattractants to neutrophils and macrophages. Leukocytes also move toward chemoattractants C5a, a complement component, and pathogen-specific ligands on bacteria.

Mechanisms concerning chemorepellents are less known than chemoattractants. Although chemorepellents work to confer an avoidance response in organisms, &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; adapt to a chemorepellent, Netrin-1 peptide, within 10 minutes of exposure; however, exposure to chemorepellents such as GTP, PACAP-38, and nociceptin show no such adaptations. GTP and ATP are chemorepellents in micro-molar concentrations to both &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; and &quot;Paramecium&quot;. These organisms avoid these molecules by producing avoiding reactions to re-orient themselves away from the gradient.

==Eukaryotic chemotaxis==

The mechanism of chemotaxis that eukaryotic cells employ is quite different from that in the bacteria &quot;E. coli&quot;; however, sensing of chemical gradients is still a crucial step in the process. Due to their small size and other biophysical constraints, &quot;E. coli&quot; cannot directly detect a concentration gradient. Instead, they employ temporal gradient sensing, where they move over larger distances several times their own width and measure the rate at which perceived chemical concentration changes.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotes and have receptors embedded uniformly throughout the cell membrane. Eukaryotic chemotaxis involves detecting a concentration gradient spatially by comparing the asymmetric activation of these receptors at the different ends of the cell. Activation of these receptors results in migration towards chemoattractants, or away from chemorepellants. In mating yeast, which are non-motile, patches of polarity proteins on the cell cortex can relocate in a chemotactic fashion up pheromone gradients.

It has also been shown that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are capable of chemotactic memory. In prokaryotes, this mechanism involves the methylation of receptors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). This results in their desensitization and allows prokaryotes to &quot;remember&quot; and adapt to a chemical gradient. In contrast, chemotactic memory in eukaryotes can be explained by the Local Excitation Global Inhibition (LEGI) model. LEGI involves the balance between a fast excitation and delayed inhibition which controls downstream signaling such as Ras activation and PIP3 production.

Levels of receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and the effector mechanisms all represent diverse, eukaryotic-type components. In eukaryotic unicellular cells, amoeboid movement and cilium or the eukaryotic flagellum are the main effectors (e.g., Amoeba or Tetrahymena). Some eukaryotic cells of higher vertebrate origin, such as immune cells also move to where they need to be. Besides immune competent cells (granulocyte, monocyte, lymphocyte) a large group of cells—considered previously to be fixed into tissues—are also motile in special physiological (e.g., mast cell, fibroblast, endothelial cells) or pathological conditions (e.g., metastases). Chemotaxis has high significance in the early phases of embryogenesis as development of germ layers is guided by gradients of signal molecules.

===Detection of a gradient of chemoattractant===
The specific molecule/s that allow a eukaryotic cells detect a gradient of chemoattractant ligands (that is, a sort of the molecular compass that detects the direction of a chemoattractant) seems to change depending on the cell and chemoattractant receptor involved or even the concentration of the chemoattractant. However, these molecules apparently are activated independently of the motility of the cell. That is, even an immnobilized cell is still able to detect the direction of a chemoattractant. There appear to be mechanisms by which an external chemotactic gradient is sensed and turned into an intracellular Ras and PIP3 gradients, which results in a gradient and the activation of a signaling pathway, culminating in the polymerisation of actin filaments. The growing distal end of actin filaments develops connections with the internal surface of the plasma membrane via different sets of peptides and results in the formation of anterior pseudopods and posterior uropods.
Cilia of eukaryotic cells can also produce chemotaxis; in this case, it is mainly a Ca2+-dependent induction of the microtubular system of the basal body and the beat of the 9 + 2 microtubules within cilia. The orchestrated beating of hundreds of cilia is synchronized by a submembranous system built between basal bodies.
The details of the signaling pathways are still not totally clear.

====Chemotaxis-related migratory responses====

Chemotaxis refers to the directional migration of cells in response to chemical gradients; several variations of chemical-induced migration exist as listed below. 
* &quot;Chemokinesis&quot; refers to an increase in cellular motility in response to chemicals in the surrounding environment. Unlike chemotaxis, the migration stimulated by chemokinesis lacks directionality, and instead increases environmental scanning behaviors. 
* In &quot;haptotaxis&quot; the gradient of the chemoattractant is expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid. The most common biologically active haptotactic surface is the extracellular matrix (ECM); the presence of bound ligands is responsible for induction of transendothelial migration and angiogenesis.
* &quot;Necrotaxis&quot; embodies a special type of chemotaxis when the chemoattractant molecules are released from necrotic or apoptotic cells. Depending on the chemical character of released substances, necrotaxis can accumulate or repel cells, which underlines the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon.

===Receptors===
In general, eukaryotic cells sense the presence of chemotactic stimuli through the use of 7-transmembrane (or serpentine) heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors, a class representing a significant portion of the genome. Some members of this gene superfamily are used in eyesight (rhodopsins) as well as in olfaction (smelling). The main classes of chemotaxis receptors are triggered by:
* Formyl peptides - formyl peptide receptors (FPR), 
* Chemokines - chemokine receptors (CCR or CXCR), and 
* Leukotrienes - leukotriene receptors (BLT).
However, induction of a wide set of membrane receptors (e.g., cyclic nucleotides, amino acids, insulin, vasoactive peptides) also elicit migration of the cell.

====Chemotactic selection====

While some chemotaxis receptors are expressed in the surface membrane with long-term characteristics, as they are determined genetically, others have short-term dynamics, as they are assembled &quot;ad hoc&quot; in the presence of the ligand. The diverse features of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands allows for the possibility of selecting chemotactic responder cells with a simple chemotaxis assay By chemotactic selection, we can determine whether a still-uncharacterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway. The term &quot;chemotactic selection&quot; is also used to designate a technique that separates eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells according to their chemotactic responsiveness to selector ligands.

===Chemotactic ligands===
The number of molecules capable of eliciting chemotactic responses is relatively high, and we can distinguish primary and secondary chemotactic molecules. The main groups of the primary ligands are as follows:
* &quot;Formyl peptides&quot; are di-, tri-, tetrapeptides of bacterial origin, formylated on the N-terminus of the peptide. They are released from bacteria in vivo or after decomposition of the cell, a typical member of this group is the N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (abbreviated fMLF or fMLP). Bacterial fMLF is a key component of inflammation has characteristic chemoattractant effects in neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. The chemotactic factor ligands and receptors related to formyl peptides are summarized in the related article, Formyl peptide receptors.
* &quot;Complement 3a (C3a) and complement 5a (C5a)&quot; are intermediate products of the complement cascade. Their synthesis is joined to the three alternative pathways (classical, lectin-dependent, and alternative) of complement activation by a convertase enzyme. The main target cells of these derivatives are neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes as well.
* &quot;Chemokines&quot; belong to a special class of cytokines; not only do their groups (C, CC, CXC, CX3C chemokines) represent structurally related molecules with a special arrangement of disulfide bridges but also their target cell specificity is diverse. CC chemokines act on monocytes (e.g., RANTES), and CXC chemokines are neutrophil granulocyte-specific (e.g., IL-8). Investigations of the three-dimensional structures of chemokines provided evidence that a characteristic composition of beta-sheets and an alpha helix provides expression of sequences required for interaction with the chemokine receptors. Formation of dimers and their increased biological activity was demonstrated by crystallography of several chemokines, e.g. IL-8.
*Metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids
** &quot;Leukotrienes&quot; are eicosanoid lipid mediators made by the metabolism of arachidonic acid by ALOX5 (also termed 5-lipoxygenase). Their most prominent member with chemotactic factor activity is leukotriene B4, which elicits adhesion, chemotaxis, and aggregation of leukocytes. The chemoattractant action of LTB4 is induced via either of two G protein–coupled receptors, BLT1 and BLT2, which are highly expressed in cells involved in inflammation and allergy.
** The family of 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid eicosanoids are arachidonic acid metabolites also formed by ALOX5. Three members of the family form naturally and have prominent chemotactic activity. These, listed in order of decreasing potency, are: &quot;5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid&quot;, &quot;5-oxo-15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid&quot;, and &quot;5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid&quot;. This family of agonists stimulates chemotactic responses in human eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes by binding to the Oxoeicosanoid receptor 1, which like the receptors for leukotriene B4, is a G protein-coupled receptor. Aside from the skin, neutrophils are the body&#x27;s first line of defense against bacterial infections. After leaving nearby blood vessels, these cells recognize chemicals produced by bacteria in a cut or scratch and migrate &quot;toward the smell&quot;. 
**&quot;5-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid&quot; and &quot;5-oxoeicosatrienoic acid&quot; are metabolites of Mead acid (5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrirenoid acid); they stimulate leukocyte chemotaxis through the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 with 5-oxoeicosatrienoic acid being as potent as its arachidonic acid-derived analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, in stimulating human blood eosinophil and neutrophil chemotaxis.
**&quot;12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid&quot; is an eicosanoid metabolite of arachidonic acid made by ALOX12 which stimulates leukocyte chemotaxis through the leukotriene B4 receptor, BLT2.
**&quot;Prostaglandin D2&quot; is an eicosanoid metabolite of arachidononic acid made by cyclooxygenase 1 or cyclooxygenase 2 that stimulates chemotaxis through the Prostaglandin DP2 receptor. It elicits chemotactic responses in eosinophils, basophils, and T helper cells of the Th2 subtype.
**&quot;12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid&quot; is a non-eicosanoid metabolite of arachidonic acid made by cyclooxygenase 1 or cyclooxygenase 2 that stimulates leukocyte chemotaxis though the leukotriene B4 receptor, BLT2.
**&quot;15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid&quot; is an eicosanoid metabolite of arachidonic acid made my ALOX15; it has weak chemotactic activity for human monocytes (sees 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid#15-oxo-ETE). The receptor or other mechanism by which this metabolite stimulates chemotaxis has not been elucidated.

==== Chemotactic range fitting ====

Chemotactic responses elicited by ligand-receptor interactions vary with the concentration of the ligand. Investigations of ligand families (e.g. amino acids or oligopeptides) demonstrates that chemoattractant activity occurs over a wide range, while chemorepellent activities have narrow ranges.

==Clinical significance==
A changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.
Altered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g., Escherichia coli) or intracellular (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes) pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.
Apart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.

==Mathematical models==
Several mathematical models of chemotaxis were developed depending on the type of
* Migration (e.g., basic differences of bacterial swimming, movement of unicellular eukaryotes with cilia/flagellum and amoeboid migration)
* Physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals (e.g., diffusion) working as ligands
* Biological characteristics of the ligands (attractant, neutral, and repellent molecules)
* Assay systems applied to evaluate chemotaxis (see incubation times, development, and stability of concentration gradients)
* Other environmental effects possessing direct or indirect influence on the migration (lighting, temperature, magnetic fields, etc.)

Although interactions of the factors listed above make the behavior of the solutions of mathematical models of chemotaxis rather complex, it is possible to describe the basic phenomenon of chemotaxis-driven motion in a straightforward way. Indeed, let us denote with formula_1 the spatially non-uniform concentration of the chemo-attractant and formula_2 as its gradient. Then the chemotactic cellular flow (also called current) formula_3 that is generated by the chemotaxis is linked to the above gradient by the law:where formula_4 is the spatial density of the cells and formula_5 is the so-called &#x27;Chemotactic coefficient&#x27; - formula_6 is often not constant, but a decreasing function of the chemo-attractant. For some quantity formula_7 that is subject to total flux formula_8 and generation/destruction term formula_9, it is possible to formulate a continuity equation:

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the divergence. This general equation applies to both the cell density and the chemo-attractant. Therefore, incorporating a diffusion flux into the total flux term, the interactions between these quantities are governed by a set of coupled reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing the change in formula_12 and formula_13: &amp;= f(C) + \nabla\cdot \left[D_{C}\nabla C - C\chi(\varphi)\nabla\varphi \right ] \\
{\partial \varphi\over{\partial t}} &amp;= g(\varphi,C) + \nabla \cdot (D_{\varphi}\nabla\varphi)
\end{aligned} &lt;/math&gt;|border colour=#0073CF|background colour=#F5FFFA}}where formula_14 describes the growth in cell density, formula_15 is the kinetics/source term for the chemo-attractant, and the diffusion coefficients for cell density and the chemo-attractant are respectively formula_16 and formula_17.

Spatial ecology of soil microorganisms is a function of their chemotactic sensitivities towards substrate and fellow organisms. The chemotactic behavior of the bacteria was proven to lead to non-trivial population patterns even in the absence of environmental heterogeneities. The presence of structural pore scale heterogeneities has an extra impact on the emerging bacterial patterns.

==Measurement of chemotaxis==

A wide range of techniques is available to evaluate chemotactic activity of cells or the chemoattractant and chemorepellent character of ligands.
The basic requirements of the measurement are as follows:
* Concentration gradients can develop relatively quickly and persist for a long time in the system
* Chemotactic and chemokinetic activities are distinguished
* Migration of cells is free toward and away on the axis of the concentration gradient
* Detected responses are the results of active migration of cells

Despite the fact that an ideal chemotaxis assay is still not available, there are several protocols and pieces of equipment that offer good correspondence with the conditions described above. The most commonly used are summarised in the table below:
==Artificial chemotactic systems==
&quot;Chemical robots&quot; that use artificial chemotaxis to navigate autonomously have been designed. Applications include targeted delivery of drugs in the body. More recently, enzyme molecules have also shown positive chemotactic behavior in the gradient of their substrates. The thermodynamically favorable binding of enzymes to their specific substrates is recognized as the origin of enzymatic chemotaxis. Additionally, enzymes in cascades have also shown substrate-driven chemotactic aggregation.

Apart from active enzymes, non-reacting molecules also show chemotactic behavior. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.

<doc id="7406" wikidata="Q23064" url="?curid=7406" title="Cheshire">
<text>Cheshire ( ) is a ceremonial county in North West England. It is bordered by Merseyside to the north-west, Greater Manchester to the north-east, Derbyshire to the east, Staffordshire to the south-east, and Shropshire to the south; to the west it is bordered by the Welsh counties of Flintshire and Wrexham, and has a short coastline on the Dee Estuary. Warrington is the largest settlement, and the city of Chester is the county town.

The county has an area of and had a population of 1,095,500 at the 2021 census. The north and west are relatively urbanised, and contain the settlements of Warrington, Chester, Runcorn, Widnes, and Ellesmere Port. The south and east of the county are primarily rural, and the largest settlement is Crewe. For local government purposes Cheshire comprises four unitary authority areas: Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. The county historically included all of the Wirral Peninsula and parts of southern Greater Manchester and northern Derbyshire, but excluded Widnes and Warrington.

The landscape of the county is dominated by the Cheshire Plain, an area of relatively flat land divided by the Mid-Cheshire Ridge. To the west, Cheshire contains the south of the Wirral Peninsula, and to the east the landscape rises to the Pennines, where the county contains part of the Peak District. The River Mersey runs through the north of Cheshire before broadening into its wide estuary; the River Dee forms part of the county&#x27;s border with Wales, then fully enters England and flows through the city of Chester before re-entering Wales upstream of its estuary. Red Triassic sandstone forms the bedrock of much of the county, and was used in the construction of many of its buildings.

==Toponymy==
Cheshire&#x27;s name was originally derived from an early name for Chester, and was first recorded as &quot;Legeceasterscir&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, meaning &quot;the shire of the city of legions&quot;. Although the name first appears in 980, it is thought that the county was created by Edward the Elder around 920. In the Domesday Book, Chester was recorded as having the name &quot;Cestrescir&quot; (Chestershire), derived from the name for Chester at the time. Through the next few centuries a series of changes that occurred in the English language, which have included simplifications and elision, has resulted in the name Cheshire.

Because of the historically close links with the land bordering Cheshire to the west, which became modern Wales, there is a history of interaction between Cheshire and North Wales. The Domesday Book records Cheshire as having two complete Hundreds (Atiscross and Exestan) that later became the principal part of Flintshire. Additionally, another large portion of the Duddestan Hundred later became known as English Maelor (Maelor Saesneg) when it was transferred to North Wales. For this and other reasons, the Welsh language name for Cheshire, , is sometimes used.

==History==

===Earldom===

After the Norman conquest of 1066 by William I, dissent and resistance continued for many years after the invasion. In 1069 local resistance in Cheshire was finally put down using draconian measures as part of the Harrying of the North. The ferocity of the campaign against the English populace was enough to end all future resistance. Examples were made of major landowners such as Earl Edwin of Mercia, their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst Norman barons.

The earldom was sufficiently independent from the kingdom of England that the 13th-century Magna Carta did not apply to the shire of Chester, so the earl wrote up his own Chester Charter at the petition of his barons.

===County Palatine===
William I made Cheshire a county palatine and gave Gerbod the Fleming the new title of Earl of Chester. When Gerbod returned to Normandy in about 1070, the king used his absence to declare the earldom forfeit and gave the title to Hugh d&#x27;Avranches (nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or &quot;wolf&quot;). Because of Cheshire&#x27;s strategic location on the Welsh Marches, the Earl had complete autonomous powers to rule on behalf of the king in the county palatine.

====Hundreds====

Cheshire in the Domesday Book (1086) is recorded as a much larger county than it is today. It included two hundreds, Atiscross and Exestan, that later became part of North Wales. At the time of the Domesday Book, it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as English Maelor (which used to be a detached part of Flintshire) in Wales. The area between the Mersey and Ribble (referred to in the Domesday Book as &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot;) formed part of the returns for Cheshire. Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire, more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the River Mersey. With minor variations in spelling across sources, the complete list of hundreds of Cheshire at this time are: Atiscross, Bochelau, Chester, Dudestan, Exestan, Hamestan, Middlewich, Riseton, Roelau, Tunendune, Warmundestrou and Wilaveston.

====Feudal baronies====
There were 8 feudal baronies in Chester, the barons of Kinderton, Halton, Malbank, Mold, Shipbrook, Dunham-Massey, and the honour of Chester itself. Feudal baronies or baronies by tenure were granted by the Earl as forms of feudal land tenure within the palatinate in a similar way to which the king granted English feudal baronies within England proper. An example is the barony of Halton. One of Hugh d&#x27;Avranche&#x27;s barons has been identified as Robert Nicholls, Baron of Halton and Montebourg.

====North Mersey to Lancashire====
In 1182, the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of Lancashire, resolving any uncertainty about the county in which the land &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot; was. Over the years, the ten hundreds consolidated and changed names to leave just seven—Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich and Wirral.

===Principality: Merging of Palatine and Earldom===

In 1397 the county had lands in the march of Wales added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the &quot;Cheshire Guard&quot;. As a result, the King&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester&quot;. No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard&#x27;s fall in 1399.

===Lieutenancy: North split-off===
====District====
Through the Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, some areas in the north became part of the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Stockport (previously a county borough), Altrincham, Hyde, Dukinfield and Stalybridge in the north-east became part of Greater Manchester. Much of the Wirral Peninsula in the north-west, including the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, joined Merseyside as the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. At the same time the Tintwistle Rural District was transferred to Derbyshire. The area of south Lancashire not included within either the Merseyside or Greater Manchester counties, including Widnes and the county borough of Warrington, was added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire.

====District and Unitary====

Halton and Warrington became unitary authorities independent of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 1998, but remain part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes and also for fire and policing. Halton is part of Liverpool City Region combined authority, which also includes the five metropolitan boroughs of Merseyside.

A referendum for a further local government reform connected with an elected regional assembly was planned for 2004, but was abandoned.

====Unitary====
As part of the local government restructuring in April 2009, Cheshire County Council and the Cheshire districts were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities, Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester. The existing unitary authorities of Halton and Warrington were not affected by the change.

== Governance ==
===Current===

Cheshire has no county-wide elected local council, but it does have a Lord Lieutenant under the Lieutenancies Act 1997 and a High Sheriff under the Sheriffs Act 1887.

Local government functions apart from the Police and Fire/Rescue services are carried out by four smaller unitary authorities: Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. All four unitary authority areas have borough status.

Policing and fire and rescue services are still provided across the county as a whole. The Cheshire Fire Authority consist of members of the four councils, while governance of Cheshire Constabulary is performed by the elected Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner.

Winsford is a major administrative hub for Cheshire with the Police and Fire &amp; Rescue Headquarters based in the town as well as a majority of Cheshire West and Chester Council. It was also home to the former Vale Royal Borough Council and Cheshire County Council.

Devolution talks for the county were scheduled for Autumn 2024. Plans to establish a Cheshire and Warrington Combined Authority were approved by the UK government in February 2025. Halton Borough has been a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority since that authority was established in 2014.

===Transition into a lieutenancy===
From 1 April 1974 the area under the control of the county council was divided into eight local government districts; Chester, Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, Ellesmere Port and Neston, Halton, Macclesfield, Vale Royal and Warrington. Halton (which includes the towns of Runcorn and Widnes) and Warrington became unitary authorities in 1998. The remaining districts and the county were abolished as part of local government restructuring on 1 April 2009. The Halton and Warrington boroughs were not affected by the 2009 restructuring.

On 25 July 2007, the Secretary of State Hazel Blears announced she was &#x27;minded&#x27; to split Cheshire into two new unitary authorities, Cheshire West and Chester, and Cheshire East. She confirmed she had not changed her mind on 19 December 2007 and therefore the proposal to split two-tier Cheshire into two would proceed. Cheshire County Council leader Paul Findlow, who attempted High Court legal action against the proposal, claimed that splitting Cheshire would only disrupt excellent services while increasing living costs for all. On 31 January 2008 &quot;The Standard&quot;, Cheshire and district&#x27;s newspaper, announced that the legal action had been dropped. Members against the proposal were advised that they may be unable to persuade the court that the decision of Hazel Blears was &quot;manifestly absurd&quot;.

The Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority covers the area formerly occupied by the City of Chester and the boroughs of Ellesmere Port and Neston and Vale Royal; Cheshire East now covers the area formerly occupied by the boroughs of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, and Macclesfield. The changes were implemented on 1 April 2009.

Congleton Borough Council pursued an appeal against the judicial review it lost in October 2007. The appeal was dismissed on 4 March 2008.

==Geography==
===Physical===
A plain of glacial till and other glacio-fluvial sediments extends across much of Cheshire, separating the hills of North Wales and the Pennines. Known as the Cheshire Plain, it was formed following the retreat of a Quaternary ice sheet which left the area dotted with kettle holes, those which hold water being referred to as meres. The bedrock of this region is almost entirely Triassic sandstone, outcrops of which have long been quarried, notably at Runcorn, providing the distinctive red stone for Liverpool Cathedral and Chester Cathedral.

The eastern half of the county is Upper Triassic Mercia Mudstone laid down with large salt deposits which were mined for hundreds of years around Winsford. Separating this area from Lower Triassic Sherwood Sandstone to the west is a prominent sandstone ridge known as the Mid Cheshire Ridge. A footpath, the Sandstone Trail, follows this ridge from Frodsham to Whitchurch passing Delamere Forest, Beeston Castle and earlier Iron Age forts.

The western fringes of the Peak District - the southernmost extent of the Pennine range - form the eastern part of the county. The highest point (county top) in the historic county of Cheshire was Black Hill () near Crowden in the Cheshire Panhandle, a long eastern projection of the county which formerly stretched along the northern side of Longdendale and on the border with the West Riding of Yorkshire. Black Hill is now the highest point in the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire.

Within the current ceremonial county and the unitary authority of Cheshire East the highest point is Shining Tor on the Derbyshire/Cheshire border between Macclesfield and Buxton, at above sea level. After Shining Tor, the next highest point in Cheshire is Shutlingsloe, at above sea level. Shutlingsloe lies just to the south of Macclesfield Forest and is sometimes humorously referred to as the &quot;Matterhorn of Cheshire&quot; thanks to its distinctive steep profile.

===Human===
====Green belt====

Cheshire contains portions of two green belt areas surrounding the large conurbations of Merseyside and Greater Manchester (North Cheshire Green Belt, part of the North West Green Belt) and Stoke-on-Trent (South Cheshire Green Belt, part of the Stoke-on-Trent Green Belt), these were first drawn up from the 1950s. Contained primarily within Cheshire East and Chester West &amp; Chester, with small portions along the borders of the Halton and Warrington districts, towns and cities such as Chester, Macclesfield, Alsager, Congleton, Northwich, Ellesmere Port, Knutsford, Warrington, Poynton, Disley, Neston, Wilmslow, Runcorn, and Widnes are either surrounded wholly, partially enveloped by, or on the fringes of the belts. The North Cheshire Green Belt is contiguous with the Peak District Park boundary inside Cheshire.

====Borders====
The ceremonial county borders Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire in England along with Flintshire and Wrexham in Wales, arranged by compass directions as shown in the table. below. Cheshire also forms part of the North West England region.

=== Flora and fauna ===

In July 2022, beavers bred in Cheshire for the first time in 400 years, following a reintroduction scheme.

==Demography==
===Population===


Based on the Census of 2001, the overall population of Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester is 673,781, of which 51.3% of the population were male and 48.7% were female. Of those aged between 0–14 years, 51.5% were male and 48.4% were female; and of those aged over 75 years, 62.9% were female and 37.1% were male. This increased to 699,735 at the 2011 Census. The population for 2021 is forecast to be 708,000.

In 2001, the population density of Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester was 32 people per km2, lower than the North West average of 42 people/km2 and the England and Wales average of 38 people/km2. Ellesmere Port and Neston had a greater urban density than the rest of the county with 92 people/km2.

===Ethnicity===
In 2001, ethnic white groups accounted for 98% (662,794) of the population, and 10,994 (2%) in ethnic groups other than white.

Of the 2% in non-white ethnic groups:

* 3,717 (34%) belonged to mixed ethnic groups
* 3,336 (30%) were Asian or Asian British
* 1,076 (10%) were black or black British
* 1,826 (17%) were of Chinese ethnic groups
* 1,039 (9%) were of other ethnic groups.

==Religion==

In the 2001 Census, 81% of the population (542,413) identified themselves as Christian; 124,677 (19%) did not identify with any religion or did not answer the question; 5,665 (1%) identified themselves as belonging to other major world religions; and 1,033 belonged to other religions.

The boundary of the Church of England Diocese of Chester follows most closely the pre-1974 county boundary of Cheshire, so it includes all of Wirral, Stockport, and the Cheshire panhandle that included Tintwistle Rural District council area. In terms of Roman Catholic church administration, most of Cheshire falls into the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury.

==Economy==

Cheshire has a diverse economy with significant sectors including agriculture, automotive, bio-technology, chemical, financial services, food and drink, ICT, and tourism. The county is famous for the production of Cheshire cheese, salt and silk. The county has seen a number of inventions and firsts in its history.

A mainly rural county, Cheshire has a high concentration of villages. Agriculture is generally based on the dairy trade, and cattle are the predominant livestock. Land use given to agriculture has fluctuated somewhat, and in 2005 totalled 1558 km2 over 4,609 holdings. Based on holdings by EC farm type in 2005, 8.51 km2 was allocated to dairy farming, with another 11.78 km2 allocated to cattle and sheep.
The chemical industry in Cheshire was founded in Roman times, with the mining of salt in Winsford, Middlewich and Northwich. Salt is still mined in the area by British Salt. The salt mining has led to a continued chemical industry around Northwich, with Brunner Mond based in the town. Other chemical companies, including Ineos (formerly ICI), have plants at Runcorn. The Essar Refinery (formerly Shell Stanlow Refinery) is at Ellesmere Port. The oil refinery has operated since 1924 and has a capacity of 12 million tonnes per year.

Crewe was once the centre of the British railway industry, and remains a major railway junction. The Crewe railway works, built in 1840, employed 20,000 people at its peak, although the workforce is now less than 1,000. Crewe is also the home of Bentley cars. Also within Cheshire are manufacturing plants for Jaguar and Vauxhall Motors in Ellesmere Port.

The county also has an aircraft industry, with the BAE Systems facility at Woodford Aerodrome, part of BAE System&#x27;s Military Air Solutions division. The facility designed and constructed Avro Lancaster and Avro Vulcan bombers and the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod. On the Cheshire border with Flintshire is the Broughton aircraft factory, more recently associated with Airbus.

Tourism in Cheshire from within the UK and overseas continues to perform strongly. Over 8 million nights of accommodation (both UK and overseas) and over 2.8 million visits to Cheshire were recorded during 2003.

At the start of 2003, there were 22,020 VAT-registered enterprises in Cheshire, an increase of 7% since 1998, many in the business services (31.9%) and wholesale/retail (21.7%) sectors. Between 2002 and 2003 the number of businesses grew in four sectors: public administration and other services (6.0%), hotels and restaurants (5.1%), construction (1.7%), and business services (1.0%). The county saw the largest proportional reduction between 2001 and 2002 in employment in the energy and water sector and there was also a significant reduction in the manufacturing sector. The largest growth during this period was in the other services and distribution, hotels and retail sectors.

Cheshire is considered to be an affluent county. However, towns such as Crewe and Winsford have significant deprivation. The county&#x27;s proximity to the cities of Manchester and Liverpool means counter urbanisation is common. Cheshire West has a fairly large proportion of residents who work in Liverpool and Manchester, while the town of Northwich and area of Cheshire East falls more within Manchester&#x27;s sphere of influence.

==Education==
All four local education authorities in Cheshire operate only comprehensive state school systems. When Altrincham, Sale and Bebington were moved from Cheshire to Trafford and Merseyside in 1974, they took some former Cheshire selective schools. There are two universities based in the county, the University of Chester and the Chester campus of The University of Law. The Crewe campus of Manchester Metropolitan University was scheduled to close in 2019.

==Culture==
===Arts and entertainment===

Cheshire has produced musicians such as Joy Division members Ian Curtis and Stephen Morris, One Direction member Harry Styles, the members of The 1975, Take That member Gary Barlow, The Cult member Ian Astbury, Catfish and the Bottlemen member Van McCann, Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts, Stephen Hough, John Mayall, The Charlatans member Tim Burgess, and Nigel Stonier.

Actors from Cheshire include Russ Abbot, Warren Brown, Julia Chan, Ray Coulthard, Daniel Craig, Tim Curry, Wendy Hiller, Tom Hughes, Tim McInnerny, Ben Miller, Pete Postlethwaite, Adam Rickitt, John Steiner, and Ann Todd. The most famous author from the county is Lewis Carroll, who wrote &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and named the Cheshire Cat character after it. Other notable Cheshire writers include Hall Caine, Alan Garner, and Elizabeth Gaskell. Artists from Cheshire include ceramic artist Emma Bossons and sculptor/photographer Andy Goldsworthy.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations in the county include Chester&#x27;s Dee Radio, Capital North West and Wales, Smooth Wales, Cheshire&#x27;s Silk Radio and Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire. It is one of only four counties in the country (along with County Durham, Dorset, and Rutland) that does not have its own designated BBC radio station; the south and parts of the east are covered by BBC Radio Stoke, while BBC Radio Merseyside tends to cover the west, and BBC Radio Manchester covers the north and parts of the east. The BBC directs readers to Stoke and Staffordshire when Cheshire is selected on their website. There were plans to launch BBC Radio Cheshire, but those were shelved in 2007 after the BBC license fee settlement was lower than expected.

===Sports===
Athletes native to Cheshire include sailor Ben Ainslie, cricketer Ian Botham, rock climber Shauna Coxsey, boxer Tyson Fury, oarsman Matt Langridge, mountaineer George Mallory, marathon runner Paula Radcliffe, cyclist Sarah Storey, and hurdler Shirley Strong. It has also been home to numerous athletes from outside the county. Many Premier League footballers have relocated there over the years upon joining nearby teams such as Manchester United FC, Manchester City FC, Everton FC, and Liverpool FC. These include Dean Ashton, Seth Johnson, Jesse Lingard and Michael Owen, The &quot;Cheshire Golden Triangle&quot; is the collective name for a group of adjacent Cheshire villages where the number of footballers, actors, and entrepreneurs moving in over the years led to the average house prices becoming some of the most expensive in the UK.

Cheshire has one Football League team, Crewe Alexandra, which plays in . The next highest-placed teams are Chester and Warrington Town, who both compete in the National League North, the sixth tier of English football. Northwich Victoria, another ex-League team which was a founding member of the Football League Division Two in 1892/1893, now represents Cheshire in the Northern Premier League along with Nantwich Town. Macclesfield Town another former League club, went into liquidation in 2020; a phoenix club, Macclesfield, was formed in 2021.

The Warrington Wolves and Widnes Vikings are the premier rugby league teams in Cheshire; the former plays in the Super League, while the latter plays in the Championship. There are also numerous junior clubs in the county, including Chester Gladiators. Cheshire County Cricket Club is one of the clubs that make up the minor counties of English and Welsh cricket. Cheshire also is represented in the highest level basketball league in the UK, the BBL, by Cheshire Phoenix (formerly Cheshire Jets). Europe&#x27;s largest motorcycle event, the Thundersprint, is held in Northwich every May.

===Other===
The Royal Cheshire Show, an annual agricultural show, has taken place since the 1800s.

Cheshire also produced a military hero in Norman Cyril Jones, a World War I flying ace who won the Distinguished Flying Cross.

===Unofficial county flower===
As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity Plantlife chose the cuckooflower as the county flower. Previously, a sheaf of golden wheat was the county emblem, a reference to the Earl of Chester&#x27;s arms in use from the 12th century.

===Landmarks===
Prehistoric burial grounds have been discovered at The Bridestones near Congleton (Neolithic) and Robin Hood&#x27;s Tump near Alpraham (Bronze Age). The remains of Iron Age hill forts are found on sandstone ridges at several locations in Cheshire. Examples include Maiden Castle on Bickerton Hill, Helsby Hillfort and Woodhouse Hillfort at Frodsham. The Roman fortress and walls of Chester, perhaps the earliest building works in Cheshire remaining above ground, are constructed from purple-grey sandstone.

The distinctive local red sandstone has been used for many monumental and ecclesiastical buildings throughout the county: for example, the medieval Beeston Castle, Chester Cathedral and numerous parish churches. Occasional residential and industrial buildings, such as Helsby railway station (1849), are also in this sandstone.

Many surviving buildings from the 15th to 17th centuries are timbered, particularly in the southern part of the county. Notable examples include the moated manor house Little Moreton Hall, dating from around 1450, and many commercial and residential buildings in Chester, Nantwich and surrounding villages.

Early brick buildings include Peover Hall near Macclesfield (1585), Tattenhall Hall (pre-1622), and the Pied Bull Hotel in Chester (17th-century). From the 18th century, orange, red or brown brick became the predominant building material used in Cheshire, although earlier buildings are often faced or dressed with stone. Examples from the Victorian period onwards often employ distinctive brick detailing, such as brick patterning and ornate chimney stacks and gables. Notable examples include Arley Hall near Northwich, Willington Hall near Chester (both by Nantwich architect George Latham) and Overleigh Lodge, Chester. From the Victorian era, brick buildings often incorporate timberwork in a mock Tudor style, and this hybrid style has been used in some modern residential developments in the county. Industrial buildings, such as the Macclesfield silk mills (for example, Waters Green New Mill), are also usually in brick.

==Settlements==

The county is home to some of the most affluent areas of northern England, including Alderley Edge, Wilmslow, Prestbury, Tarporley and Knutsford, named in 2006 as the most expensive place to buy a house in the north of England. The former Cheshire town of Altrincham was in second place. The area is sometimes referred to as The Golden Triangle on account of the area in and around the aforementioned towns and villages. Holmes Chapel has increasingly become a sought out tourist destination due to being the former hometown of celebrity Harry Styles, and is also undergoing a planned population increase.

Thingwall, currently in the county of Merseyside but historically part of Cheshire until 1974, is known for having once been the base of a Viking parliament established by Norse settlers in the area.

There is currently one city in the county officially, Chester. However, it remains a disputed piece of folklore that the village of Thelwall (today administratively paired with its neighbour Grappenhall in a civil parish) was at one time considered a city. Warrington is currently the largest urban settlement in the county overall despite its town status, and was one of the third wave of post-Second World War UK new towns designated for expansion. Other core settlements across Cheshire are:


Some settlements which were historically part of the county now fall under the ceremonial counties of Derbyshire, Merseyside and Greater Manchester:

==Transport==
===Railways===
The main railway line through the county is the West Coast Main Line. Trains on the main London to Scotland line call at Crewe (in the south of the county) and Warrington Bank Quay (in the north of the county). Trains stop at Crewe and Runcorn on the Liverpool branch of the WCML; Crewe and Macclesfield are each hourly stops on the two Manchester branches. The major interchanges are:
*Crewe (the biggest station in Cheshire) for trains to London Euston, Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley, Manchester Piccadilly and Liverpool Lime Street (via the WCML). Trains on other routes travel to Wales, the Midlands (Birmingham, Stoke and Derby) as well as suburban services to Manchester Piccadilly, Chester and Liverpool Lime Street.
*Warrington stations (Central and Bank Quay) for suburban services to Manchester Piccadilly, Chester and Liverpool Lime Street and regional express services to North Wales, London, Scotland, Yorkshire, the East Coast and the East Midlands
*Chester for urban services (via Merseyrail) to Liverpool Central, suburban services to Manchester, Warrington, Wrexham General and rural Cheshire and express services to Llandudno, Holyhead, Birmingham, the West Midlands, London and Cardiff and, from May 2019, to Leeds.

In the east of Cheshire, Macclesfield station is served by Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry and Northern, on the Manchester–London line. Services from Manchester to the south coast frequently stop at Macclesfield. Neston on the Wirral Peninsula is served by a railway station on the Borderlands line between Bidston and Wrexham.

===Roadways===

Cheshire has of roads, including of the M6, M62, M53 and M56 motorways; there are 23 interchanges and four service areas. It also has the A580 &quot;East Lancashire Road&quot; at its border with Greater Manchester at Leigh. The M6 motorway at the Thelwall Viaduct carries 140,000 vehicles every 24 hours.

Bus transport in Cheshire is provided by various operators. The major bus operator in the Cheshire area is D&amp;G Bus. Other operators in Cheshire include Stagecoach Chester &amp; Wirral and Network Warrington.

There are also several operators based outside of Cheshire, who either run services wholly within the area or services which start from outside the area. Companies include Arriva Buses Wales, Aimee&#x27;s Travel, High Peak, First Greater Manchester, D&amp;G bus and Stagecoach Manchester.

Some services are run under contract to Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East, Borough of Halton and Warrington Councils.

===Waterways===
The Cheshire canal system includes several canals originally used to transport the county&#x27;s industrial products (mostly chemicals). Nowadays they are mainly used for tourist traffic. The Cheshire Ring is formed from the Rochdale, Ashton, Peak Forest, Macclesfield, Trent and Mersey and Bridgewater canals.

The Manchester Ship Canal is a wide, stretch of water opened in 1894. It consists of the rivers Irwell and Mersey made navigable to Manchester for seagoing ships leaving the Mersey estuary. The canal passes through the north of the county via Runcorn and Warrington. Rivers and canals in the county are:

<text>In Great Britain and Ireland, a county town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within a county, and the place where public representatives are elected to parliament. Following the establishment of county councils in England in 1889, the headquarters of the new councils were usually established in the county town of each county; however, the concept of a county town pre-dates these councils.

The concept of a county town is ill-defined and unofficial. Some counties in Great Britain have their administrative bodies housed elsewhere. For example, Lancaster is the county town of Lancashire, but the county council is in Preston. Owing to the creation of unitary authorities, some county towns in Great Britain are administratively separate from the county. For example, Nottingham is separated from the rest of Nottinghamshire, and Brighton and Hove is separate from East Sussex. On a ceremonial level, both are in their own respective counties geographically.

This list shows towns or cities which held county functions at various points in time.

===Wales===
Following the Norman invasion of Wales, the Cambro-Normans created the historic shire system (also known as ancient counties). Many of these counties were named for the centre of Norman power within the new county (Caernarfonshire named for Caernarfon, Monmouthshire named for Monmouth) others were named after the previous medieval Welsh kingdoms (Ceredigon becomes Cardigan, Morgannwg becomes Glamorgan). The 1535 Laws in Wales Act established the historic counties in English law, but in Wales they were later replaced with eight preserved counties for ceremonial purposes and the twenty two principal areas are used for administrative purposes. Neither of these subdivisions use official county towns, although their administrative headquarters and ceremonial centres are often located in the historic county town.



==Great Britain, post 19th-century reforms==
With the creation of elected county councils in 1889, the administrative headquarters in some cases moved away from the traditional county town. Furthermore, in 1965 and 1974 there were major boundary changes in England and Wales and administrative counties were replaced with new metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. The boundaries underwent further alterations between 1995 and 1998 to create unitary authorities, and some of the ancient counties and county towns were restored. (Note: not all headquarters are or were called County Halls or Shire Halls e.g.: Cumbria County Council&#x27;s HQ up until 2016 was called &quot;The Courts&quot; and has since moved to Cumbria House.) Before 1974, many of the county halls were in towns and cities that had the status of a county borough i.e. a borough outside the county council&#x27;s jurisdiction.

# Due to its better transport links and more central location, some administrative functions were moved to Llangefni.
# Cardigan was often still referred to as &#x27;the county town&#x27; due to the name link. However, assizes were held at Lampeter while Aberystwyth housed the administration of the county council. Aberystwyth was therefore the de facto county town.
# Due to its better transport links and more central location, some administrative functions were moved to Llandrindod Wells.

==Ireland and Northern Ireland==
===Republic of Ireland===
The follow lists the location of the administration of each of the 31 local authorities in the Republic of Ireland, with 26 of the traditional counties.
===Northern Ireland===
Note – Despite the fact that Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, it is not the county town of any county. Greater Belfast straddles two counties – Antrim and Down.

==Jamaica==

Jamaica&#x27;s three counties were established in 1758 to facilitate the holding of courts along the lines of the British county court system, with each county having a county town. The counties have no current administrative relevance.

<text>The Constitution of Canada () is the supreme law in Canada. It outlines Canada&#x27;s system of government and the civil and human rights of those who are citizens of Canada and non-citizens in Canada. Its contents are an amalgamation of various codified acts, treaties between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples (both historical and modern), uncodified traditions and conventions. Canada is one of the oldest constitutional monarchies in the world.

The Canadian constitution includes core written documents and provisions that are constitutionally entrenched, take precedence over all other laws and place substantive limits on government action; these include the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (formerly the &quot;British North America Act, 1867)&quot; and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&quot; The &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, &quot;1867&quot; provides for a constitution &quot;similar in principle&quot; to the largely unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom, recognizes Canada as a constitutional monarchy and federal state, and outlines the legal foundations of Canadian federalism.

The Constitution of Canada includes written and unwritten components. Section 52 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; states that &quot;the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada&quot; and that any inconsistent law is of no force or effect. It further lists written documents which are included in the Constitution of Canada; these are the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; (which includes the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;), the acts and orders referred to in its schedule (including in particular the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), and any amendments to these documents.

The Supreme Court of Canada has held that this list is not exhaustive and that the Constitution of Canada includes a number of pre-confederation acts and unwritten components as well. The Canadian constitution also includes the fundamental principles of federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect for minorities. See list of Canadian constitutional documents for details.

==History of the constitution==

The first semblance of a constitution for Canada was the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The act renamed the northeasterly portion of the former French province of New France as the Province of Quebec, roughly coextensive with the southern third of contemporary Quebec. The proclamation, which established an appointed colonial government, was the constitution of Quebec until 1774 when the British parliament passed the Quebec Act, which expanded the province&#x27;s boundaries to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers (one of the grievances listed in the United States Declaration of Independence). Significantly, the Quebec Act also replaced French criminal law with the English common law system; but the French civil law system was retained for non-criminal matters.
The Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the American War of Independence and sent a wave of British loyalist refugees northward to Quebec and Nova Scotia. In 1784, the two provinces were divided: Nova Scotia was split into Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island (rejoined to Nova Scotia in 1820), Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick, while Quebec was split into Lower Canada (southern Quebec) and Upper Canada (southern through lower northern Ontario). The winter of 1837–38 saw rebellion in both Canadas, contributing to their re-union as the Province of Canada in 1841.

The &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; established the Dominion of Canada as a federation of provinces. Initially, on July 1, 1867, four provinces entered into confederation as &quot;One dominion under the name of Canada&quot;: Canada West (former Upper Canada, now Ontario), Canada East (former Lower Canada, now Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Title to the Northwest Territories was transferred by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1870, out of which the province of Manitoba (the first to be established by the Parliament of Canada) was created. British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, followed by Prince Edward Island in 1873. The Yukon Territory was created by Parliament in 1898, followed by Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905 (all out of parts of the Northwest Territories). Newfoundland, Britain&#x27;s oldest colony in the Americas and by then also a Dominion, joined Confederation in 1949. Nunavut was created in 1999 from the Northwest Territories.

An Imperial Conference in 1926 that included the leaders of all Dominions and representatives from India (which then included Burma, Bangladesh, and Pakistan), led to the eventual enactment of the Statute of Westminster 1931. The statute, an essential transitory step from the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations, provided that existing Dominions became fully sovereign of the United Kingdom and any new Dominions would be fully sovereign upon the grant of Dominion status. Although listed, Newfoundland never ratified the statute so was still subject to imperial authority when its entire system of government and economy collapsed in the mid-1930s. Canada did ratify the statute but with a requested exception—the Canadian federal and provincial governments could not agree on an amending formula for the Canadian constitution. It would be another 50 years before this was achieved. In the interim, the British parliament periodically passed constitutional amendments when requested by the government of Canada. This was never anything but a rubber stamp.

The patriation of the Canadian constitution was achieved in 1982 when the British parliament, with the request and assent of the Canadian parliament, passed the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, which included in its schedules the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The United Kingdom thus renounced any remaining responsibility for, or jurisdiction over, Canada. In a formal ceremony on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; into law on April 17, 1982.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, includes the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Before the Charter, various statutes protected an assortment of civil rights and obligations but nothing was enshrined in the constitution until 1982. The Charter has thus placed a strong focus upon individual and collective rights of the people of Canada. The enactment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has fundamentally changed much of Canadian constitutional law. The act also codified many previously oral constitutional conventions and made amendment of the constitution in general significantly more difficult. Previously, the Canadian constitution could be formally amended by an act of the British parliament, or by informal agreement between the federal and provincial governments, or even simply by adoption as the custom of an oral convention or performance that shows precedential but unwritten tradition. Since the act, textual amendments must now conform to certain specified provisions in the written portion of the Canadian constitution.

==&quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;==
This was an Act of the British parliament, originally called the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. It outlined Canada&#x27;s system of government, which combines Britain&#x27;s Westminster model of parliamentary government with the division of sovereignty (federalism). Although it is the first of 20 &quot;British North America Acts&quot;, it is the most famous as the primary document of Canadian Confederation. With the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, this Act was renamed &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. In recent years, the 1867 document has mainly served as the basis on which the division of powers between the provinces and the federal government is analyzed.

==&quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;==
Endorsed by all provincial governments except that of Quebec, this was the formal Act of Parliament that effected Canada&#x27;s full legislative independence from the United Kingdom. Part V of this act established an amending formula for the Canadian constitution, the lack of which (due to more than 50 years of disagreement between the federal and provincial governments) meant Canada&#x27;s constitutional amendments still required enactment by the British parliament after Statute of Westminster in 1931.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; was enacted as a schedule to the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, a British Act of Parliament which was introduced at the request of a joint address to Queen Elizabeth II by the Senate and House of Commons of Canada. The version of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; which is in force in Britain is in English only, but the version of the act in force in Canada is bilingual, English and French. In addition to enacting the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; provides that no further British acts of Parliament will apply to Canada as part of its law, finalizing Canada&#x27;s legislative independence.

===Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms===

As noted above, this is Part I of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The Charter is the constitutional guarantee of the civil rights and liberties of every citizen in Canada, such as freedom of expression, of religion, and of mobility. Part II addresses the rights of Aboriginal peoples in Canada.

It is written in plain language to ensure accessibility to the average citizen. It applies only to government and government actions to prevent the government from creating unconstitutional laws.

===Amending formula===

Instead of the usual parliamentary procedure, which includes the monarch&#x27;s formal royal assent for enacting legislation, amendments to any of the acts that collectively form the constitution must be done in accordance with Part V of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which provides for five different amending formulae. Amendments can be brought forward under section 46(1) by any province or the federal legislature. The general formula set out in section 38(1), known as the &quot;7/50 formula,&quot; requires: (a) assent from both the House of Commons and the Senate; (b) the approval of two-thirds of the provincial legislatures (at least seven provinces) representing at least 50 per cent of the population of the provinces (effectively, this would include at least Quebec or Ontario, as they contain more than half of the population of Canada). This formula specifically applies to amendments related to the proportionate representation in Parliament, powers, selection, and composition of the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the addition of provinces or territories.

The other amendment formulae are for particular cases as provided by the act. An amendment related to the Office of the King, the use of either official language (subject to section 43), the amending formula itself, or the composition of the Supreme Court, must be adopted by unanimous consent of all the provinces in accordance with section 41. In the case of an amendment related to provincial boundaries or the use of an official language within a province alone, the amendment must be passed by the legislatures affected by the amendment (section 43). In the case of an amendment that affects the federal government only, the amendment does not need the approval of the provinces (section 44). Similarly, amendments affecting a provincial government alone (section 45) do not need the approval of the parliament or the other provinces.

==Sources of the constitution==

Canada&#x27;s constitution has roots going back to the thirteenth century, including England&#x27;s Magna Carta and the first English Parliament of 1275. Canada&#x27;s constitution is composed of several individual statutes. There are three general methods by which a statute becomes entrenched in the Constitution:
# Specific mention as a constitutional document in section 52(2) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; (e.g., the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;).
# Constitutional entrenchment of an otherwise statutory English, British, or Canadian document because its (still in force) subject-matter provisions are explicitly assigned to one of the methods of the amending formula (per the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;)—e.g., provisions with regard to the monarchy in the English Bill of Rights 1689 or the Act of Settlement 1701. 
#*English and British statutes are part of Canadian law because of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865; section 129 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;; and the Statute of Westminster 1931. If still at least partially unrepealed those laws then became entrenched when the amending formula was made part of the constitution.
# Reference by an entrenched document—e.g., the Preamble of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; entrenchment of written and unwritten principles from the constitution of the United Kingdom or the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; reference to the Proclamation of 1763. 
#*Crucially, this includes Aboriginal rights and Crown treaties with particular First Nations (e.g., historic &quot;numbered&quot; treaties; modern land-claims agreements).

===Unwritten or uncodified sources===
The existence of unwritten constitutional components was reaffirmed in 1998 by the Supreme Court in &quot;Reference re Secession of Quebec&quot;.
The Constitution is more than a written text. It embraces the entire global system of rules and principles which govern the exercise of constitutional authority. A superficial reading of selected provisions of the written constitutional enactment, without more, may be misleading.

In practice, there have been three sources of unwritten constitutional law:

; Conventions: Constitutional conventions form part of the constitution, but they are not judicially enforceable. They include the existence of the office of prime minister and the Cabinet, the practise that the Crown in most circumstances is required to grant royal assent to bills adopted by both houses of Parliament, and the requirement that the prime minister either resign or request a dissolution and general election upon losing a vote of confidence in the House of Commons.
; Royal prerogative: Reserve powers of the Canadian Crown, being remnants of the powers once held by the British Crown, reduced over time by the parliamentary system. Primarily, these are the orders in Council, which give the government the authority to declare war, conclude treaties, issue passports, make appointments, make regulations, incorporate, and receive lands that escheat to the Crown.
; Unwritten principles:Principles that are incorporated into the Canadian constitution by the preamble of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, including a statement that the constitution is &quot;similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom&quot;, much of which is unwritten. Unlike conventions, they are justiciable. Amongst those principles most recognized as constitutional to date are federalism, liberal democracy, constitutionalism, the rule of law, and respect for minorities. Others include responsible government, representation by population, judicial independence, parliamentary supremacy, and an implied bill of rights. In one case, the Provincial Judges Reference (1997), a law was held invalid for contradicting an unwritten principle (in this case judicial independence).

==Provincial constitutions==
Unlike in most federations, Canadian provinces do not have written provincial constitutions. Provincial constitutions are instead a combination of uncodified constitution, provisions of the Constitution of Canada, and provincial statutes.

Overall structures of provincial governments (like the legislature and cabinet) are described in parts of the Constitution of Canada. Governmental structure of the original four provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario) is described in Part V of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. The three colonies that joined Canada after Confederation (British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) had existing UK legislation which described their governmental structure, and this was affirmed in each colony&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Union&quot;, which now form part of Canada&#x27;s Constitution. The remaining three provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta) were created by federal statute. Their constitutional structures are described in those statutes, which now form part of Canada&#x27;s Constitution.

All provinces have enacted legislation that establishes other rules for the structure of government. For example, every province (and territory) has an act governing elections to the legislature, and another governing procedure in the legislature. Two provinces have explicitly listed such acts as being part of their provincial constitution; see &quot;Constitution of Quebec&quot; and &quot;Constitution Act&quot; (British Columbia). However, these acts do not, generally, supersede other legislation and do not require special procedures to amend, and so they function as regular statutes rather than constitutional statutes.

A small number of non-constitutional provincial laws do supersede all other provincial legislation, as a constitution would. This is referred to as quasi-constitutionality. Quasi-constitutionality is often applied to human rights laws, allowing those laws to act as a &quot;de facto&quot; constitutional charter of rights. For example, laws preventing discrimination in employment, housing, and services have clauses making them quasi-constitutional in ten of thirteen jurisdictions.

===Amending provincial constitutions===

Section 45 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; allows each province to amend its own constitution. This applies, for example, to provincial statute laws like &quot;Constitution of Quebec&quot; and &quot;Constitution Act (British Columbia)&quot;. However, if the desired change would require an amendment to any documents that form part of the Constitution of Canada, it would require the consent of the Senate and House of Commons under section 43. This was done, for example, by the &quot;Constitution Amendment, 1998&quot;, when Newfoundland asked the federal government to amend the &quot;Terms of Union of Newfoundland&quot; to allow it to end denominational quotas for religion classes.

A small number of statutes within provincial constitutions cannot be amended by a simple majority of the legislative assembly, despite section 45. For example, section 7 of the &quot;Constitution of Alberta Amendment Act, 1990&quot; requires plebiscites of Métis settlement members before that Act can be amended. Courts have not yet ruled about whether this kind of language really would bind future legislatures, but it might do so if the higher bar was met when creating the law.

Three amendments to provincial constitutions in the 2020s have been controversially framed as amendments to the &quot;Constitution Act 1867&quot;. These are Quebec statutes purporting to add sections 90Q and 128Q and a Saskatchewan statute purporting to add section 90S. Because the Senate and House of Commons did not authorise these amendments, they would only have effect if they are amendments to provincial constitutions under the section 45 amending procedure. Constitutional scholars are divided on the validity of an amendment to a provincial constitution framed as an addition to part of the Constitution of Canada.

==Vandalism of the proclamation paper==
In 1983, Peter Greyson, an art student, entered Ottawa&#x27;s National Archives (known today as Library and Archives Canada) and poured red paint mixed with glue over a copy of the proclamation of the 1982 constitutional amendment. He said he was displeased with the federal government&#x27;s decision to allow United States missile testing in Canada and had wanted to &quot;graphically illustrate to Canadians&quot; how wrong he believed the government to be. Greyson was charged with public mischief and sentenced to 89 days in jail, 100 hours of community work, and two years of probation. A grapefruit-sized stain remains on the original document; restoration specialists opted to leave most of the paint intact, fearing that removal attempts would only cause further damage.

<text>Crochet (; ) is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term &quot;crochet&quot;, which means &#x27;hook&#x27;. Hooks can be made from different materials (aluminum, steel, metal, wood, bamboo, bone, etc.), sizes, and types (in-line, tapered, ergonomic, etc.). The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before you begin the next one, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and Broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.

==Etymology==
The word crochet is derived from the French word , a diminutive of &quot;croche&quot;, in turn from the Germanic &quot;croc&quot;, both meaning &quot;hook&quot;. It was used in 17th-century French lace-making, where the term &quot;Crochetage&quot; designated a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace. The word &quot;crochet&quot; subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the hooked needle used to produce it.

In 1567, the tailor of Mary, Queen of Scots, Jehan de Compiegne, supplied her with silk thread for sewing and crochet, &quot;soye à coudre et crochetz&quot;.

==Origins==

Knitted textiles survive from as early as the 11th century CE, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric emerges in Europe during the 19th century. Earlier work identified as crochet was commonly made by nålebinding, a different looped yarn technique.

The first known published instructions for crochet explicitly using that term to describe the craft in its present sense appeared in the Dutch magazine &quot;Penélopé&quot; in 1823. This includes a colour plate showing five styles of purse, of which three were intended to be crocheted with silk thread. The first is &quot;simple open crochet&quot; (&quot;crochet simple ajour&quot;), a mesh of chain-stitch arches. The second (illustrated here) starts in a semi-open form (&quot;demi jour&quot;), where chain-stitch arches alternate with equally long segments of slip-stitch crochet, and closes with a star made with &quot;double-crochet stitches&quot; (&quot;dubbelde hekelsteek&quot;: double-crochet in British terminology; single-crochet in US). The third purse is made entirely in double-crochet. The instructions prescribe the use of a tambour needle (as illustrated below) and introduce a number of decorative techniques.

The earliest dated reference in English to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook—&quot;shepherd&#x27;s knitting&quot;—is in &quot;The Memoirs of a Highland Lady&quot; by Elizabeth Grant (1797–1830). The journal entry, itself, is dated 1812 but was not recorded in its subsequently published form until some time between 1845 and 1867, and the actual date of publication was first in 1898. Nonetheless, the 1833 volume of &quot;Penélopé&quot; describes and illustrates a shepherd&#x27;s hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.

In 1844, one of the numerous books discussing crochet that began to appear in the 1840s states:

Two years later, the same author writes:

An instruction book from 1846 describes &quot;Shepherd or single crochet&quot; as what in current international terminology is either called single crochet or slip-stitch crochet, with U.S. terminology always using the latter (reserving single crochet for use as noted above). It similarly equates &quot;Double&quot; and &quot;French crochet&quot;.
Notwithstanding the categorical assertion of a purely British origin, there is solid evidence of a connection between French tambour embroidery, french passementerie and crochet. A form of hook known as crochet was used to create &#x27;chains in the air&#x27; as part of passementerie back in the 17th century. This is confirmed by a patent issued to the passementiers by Louis XIV in 1653, and there are earlier decorative examples of this technique. The patent lists various items, including &quot;thread for embroidery, enhanced and embellished as done with a needle, on thimbles, on the fingers, on a crochet, and on a bobbin.&quot; Similarly, chain stitch appears in Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s wardrobe accounts, starting in 1558, with further references to garments bordered with &#x27;cheyne lace&#x27; in other inventories. One example from 1588 describes &quot;a long cloak of murry velvet, with a border of small cheyne lace of Venice silver.&quot; While the exact design of the 1653 crochet is unclear, a 1723 French dictionary by Jacques Savary des Brûlons describes a crochet as a small iron instrument, three or four inches long, with a pointed, curved end and a wooden handle, used by passementiers for tasks like creating hat seams and attaching flowers to mesh. It&#x27;s most likely that the hook used in crochet came from the ones used by the french pessamenterie industry.
French tambour embroidery and the crochet needle used for it was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopedia. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable from that of a present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 &quot;Penélopé&quot; instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms &quot;tambour&quot; and &quot;crochet&quot; as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.
The strong taper of the shepherd&#x27;s hook eases the production of slip-stitch crochet but is less amenable to stitches that require multiple loops on the hook at the same time. Early yarn hooks were also continuously tapered but gradually enough to accommodate multiple loops. The design with a cylindrical shaft that is commonplace today was largely reserved for tambour-style steel needles. Both types gradually merged into the modern form that appeared toward the end of the 19th century, including both tapered and cylindrical segments, and the continuously tapered bone hook remained in industrial production until World War II.

The early instruction books make frequent reference to the alternative use of &#x27;ivory, bone, or wooden hooks&#x27; and &#x27;steel needles in a handle&#x27;, as appropriate to the stitch being made. Taken with the synonymous labeling of shepherd&#x27;s- and single crochet, and the similar equivalence of French- and double crochet, there is a strong suggestion that crochet is rooted both in tambour embroidery and shepherd&#x27;s knitting, leading to thread and yarn crochet respectively; a distinction that is still made. The locus of the fusion of all these elements—the &quot;invention&quot; noted above—has yet to be determined, as does the origin of shepherd&#x27;s knitting.

Shepherd&#x27;s hooks are still being made for local slip-stitch crochet traditions. The form in the accompanying photograph is typical for contemporary production. A longer continuously tapering design intermediate between it and the 19th-century tapered hook was also in earlier production, commonly being made from the handles of forks and spoons.

==Irish crochet==
In the 19th century, as Ireland was facing the Great Irish Famine (1845–1849), crochet lace work was introduced as a form of famine relief (the production of crocheted lace being an alternative way of making money for impoverished Irish workers). Men, women, children joined a co-operative in order to crochet and produce products to help with famine relief during the Great Irish Famine. Schools to teach crocheting were started. Teachers were trained and sent across Ireland to teach this craft. When the Irish immigrated to the Americas, they were able to take with them crocheting. Mademoiselle Riego de la Branchardiere is generally credited with the invention of Irish Crochet, publishing the first book of patterns in 1846. Irish lace became popular in Europe and America, and was made in quantity until the first World War.

==Modern practice and culture==
Fashions in crochet changed with the end of the Victorian era in the 1890s. Crocheted laces in the new Edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more elaborate in texture and complicated stitching.
The strong Victorian colors disappeared, though, and new publications called for white or pale threads, except for fancy purses, which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I, far fewer crochet patterns were published, and most of them were simplified versions of the early 20th-century patterns. After World War II, from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the United States, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, potholders, and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker&#x27;s art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.
Although crochet underwent a subsequent decline in popularity, the early 21st century has seen a revival of interest in handcrafts and DIY, as well as improvement of the quality and varieties of yarn. As well as books and classes, there are YouTube tutorials and TikTok videos to help people who may need a clearer explanation to learn how to crochet.

Filet crochet, Tunisian crochet, tapestry crochet, broomstick lace, hairpin lace, cro-hooking, and Irish crochet are all variants of the basic crochet method.

== Mental Health Benefits of Crocheting ==
Coping with anxiety, depression, major life events such as grief or divorce, and management of chronic pain and illness. Crochet is relatively low-cost and portable and the basic stitches can be easily learned by most people. Based on a study done by the Royal Society for Public Health in 2020 on 8,391 crocheters from 87 different countries over 6 weeks, 89.5% of crocheters felt calmer, 82% felt happier, and 74.7% felt more useful which can signify an improvement in mental health from participating in crochet. The benefits appear to stem from the low cost, portability, and easily learned aspects of crochet.

==Sustainability and Crochet in Fashion==
Sustainability is a key pillar of crochet, as it uses upcycled and environmentally friendly materials in yarn to create sustainable fabrics such as bamboo, hemp, cotton, linen, and wool. Since crochet is typically made by hand, crochet contributes to ethical production by adhering to the slow production of garments and accessories rather than the fast-paced and mechanized garments that are produced on a mass scale by the fast fashion industry. There are crochet machines but there is little evidence to support crochet machines contributing to mass production in the same sense that other textiles are being used in fast fashion. In addition, crochet fabric can be loosened and undone easily to be reused in a new way. Crochet can be added to worn or torn garments and to add a stylistic enhancement such as a collar or sleeves which contributes to upcycling of clothing. Crochet highlights the sustainability factor of quality versus quantity because of the customization aspect which can make crochet items more personalized. Another aspect of the sustainability of crochet is that crochet is versatile and can be used to create many different products eliminating the need to constantly buy new products.  

Many crochet and knit yarn brands have taken a stance on sustainability by aiming to increase the production of natural fibers such as organic cotton, and hemp. and wool and recycled yarns. 

Creating crocheted items has become a way to make sustainable fashion. Fast fashion brands like Shein have created products that resemble crocheted items.

Crochet has experienced a revival on the catwalk as well. Christopher Kane&#x27;s Fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection makes intensive use of the granny square, one of the most basic of crochet motifs. Websites such as Etsy and Ravelry have made it easier for individual hobbyists to sell and distribute their patterns or projects across the internet.

==Materials==
The basic materials required for crocheting are a hook, scissors (to cut yarn), and some type of material that will be crocheted, the most commonly used are yarn or thread. Alternatively, some people choose to crochet with their hands, especially for large yarns. Yarn, one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting, has varying weights which need to be taken into consideration when following patterns. The weight of the yarn can affect not only the look of the product but also the feeling. Acrylic can also be used when crocheting, as it is synthetic and an alternative to wool. Additional tools are convenient for making related accessories. Examples of such tools include cardboard cutouts, which can be used to make tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a tape measure and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects. In recent years, yarn selections have moved beyond synthetic and plant and animal-based fibers to include bamboo, qiviut, hemp, and banana stalks, to name a few. Many advanced crocheters have also incorporated recycled materials into their work in an effort to &quot;go green&quot; and experiment with new textures by using items such as plastic bags, old t-shirts or sheets, VCR or Cassette tape, and ribbon.

===Crochet hook types===
The crochet hook comes in many sizes and materials. Because sizing is categorized by the diameter of the hook&#x27;s shaft, a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. If gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size. Crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use. Hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.

Aluminum, bamboo, and plastic crochet hooks are available from 2.25 to 30 millimeters in size, or from B-1 to T/X in American sizing. Artisan-made hooks are often made of hand-turned woods, sometimes decorated with semi-precious stones or beads.

Steel crochet hooks are sized in a reverse manner – the higher the number, the smaller the hook. They range in size from 0.9 to 2.7 millimeters, or from 14 to 00 in American sizing. These hooks are used for fine crochet work such as doilies and lace.

Crochet hooks used for Tunisian crochet are elongated and have a stopper at the end of the handle, while double-ended crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle. Tunisian crochet hooks are shaped without a fat thumb grip and thus can hold many loops on the hook at a time without stretching some to different heights than others (Solovan). There is also a double hooked tool called a Cro-hook. While this is not in itself a hook, it is a device used in conjunction with a crochet hook to produce stitches.

===Yarn types===


Yarn for crochet is usually sold as balls, or skeins (hanks), although it may also be wound on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are generally sold with a &quot;yarn band&quot;, a label that describes the yarn&#x27;s weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc. It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased. Crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. The dye lot specifies a group of skeins that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when added onto existing work. If insufficient yarn of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.

The thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. This is also termed the gauge. Thicker yarns generally require large-diameter crochet hooks, whereas thinner yarns may be crocheted with thick or thin hooks. Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to work up a given project. The recommended gauge for a given ball of yarn can be found on the label that surrounds the skein when buying in stores. Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns and produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined or delicate pattern-work. Yarns are standardly grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky. Quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI). The related &quot;weight per unit length&quot; is usually measured in tex or denier.

Before use, hanks are wound into balls in which the yarn emerges from the center, making crocheting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. The winding process may be performed by hand or done with a ball winder and swift.

A yarn&#x27;s usefulness is judged by several factors, such as its &quot;loft&quot; (its ability to trap air), its &quot;resilience&quot; (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its &quot;hand&quot; (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its &quot;hairiness&quot; (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. Other factors include allergenicity, speed of drying, resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew, melting point and flammability, retention of static electricity, and the propensity to accept dyes. Desirable properties may vary for different projects, so there is no one &quot;best&quot; yarn.
Although crochet may be done with ribbons, metal wire, or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them and the spinner uses a worsted type drafting method such as the short forward draw, the yarn is smoother and called a &quot;worsted&quot;; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed and the spinner uses a woolen drafting method such as the long backward draw, the yarn is fuzzier and called &quot;woolen-spun&quot;. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous &quot;filament&quot; fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be &quot;staples&quot; (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers, and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twists (also called &quot;worst&quot;), longer fibers, and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twists than thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a &quot;slub&quot; is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn. 

The spun fibers are generally divided into animal fibers, plant, and synthetic fibers. These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates, and synthetic polymers, respectively. Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of animals such as sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana trees, soy and corn. Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. Of these types, wool is generally favored for crochet, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean and some people are allergic to it. It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.

A single spun yarn may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarn&#x27;s tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, &quot;balanced&quot; yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing &quot;cabled yarns&quot; or &quot;multi-stranded yarns&quot;. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterward to give the yarn a uniform look.

The dyeing of yarns is a complex art. Yarns need not be dyed, or they may be dyed one color or a great variety of colors. Dyeing may be done industrially, by hand, or even hand-painted onto the yarn. A great variety of synthetic dyes have been developed since the synthesis of indigo dye in the mid-19th century; however, natural dyes are also possible, although they are generally less brilliant. The color scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway. Variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes. 

==Process==
Crocheted fabric is begun by placing a slip-knot loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length. The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain. At any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. Tunisian crochet, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time. Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat (back and forth in rows) or in the round (in spirals, such as when making tubular pieces). 

==Types of stitches==

There are six main types of basic stitches (the following description uses international crochet terminology with US variants noted in brackets).
#&quot;Chain stitch (ch)&quot; – the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects. Yarn round hook (yrh) and draw through.
#&quot;Slip stitch (sl st or ss)&quot; – used to join chain stitch to form a ring. Insert hook in work, yrh, draw through.
#&quot;Double crochet (dc)&quot; (US = single crochet) – Insert hook, draw loop through, (2 loops on hook, hence double), yrh, draw through. 
#&quot;Half treble (htr)&quot; (US = half double) – yrh, insert hook, draw loop through, (3 loops on hook, hence treble), yrh, draw through all loops.
#&quot;Treble (tr)&quot; (US = double) – yrh, insert hook, draw loop through (3 loops on hook, hence treble), yrh, draw through 2 loops, yrh, draw through 2 loops.
#&quot;Double treble&quot; (US = treble or triple) – as treble but 2 yrh at start (hence &quot;double&quot; treble). Also triple treble (ttr), as treble but with 3 yrh at start, and so on.
While the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and can be replaced with a length of ch when required, e.g. 1 tr = 3 ch.

The more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations. More advanced stitches include the &quot;shell stitch&quot;, &quot;V stitch&quot;, &quot;spike stitch&quot;, &quot;Afghan stitch&quot;, &quot;butterfly stitch&quot;, &quot;popcorn stitch&quot;, &quot;cluster stitch&quot;, and &quot;crocodile stitch&quot;.

==International crochet terms and notations==
There are two main notations of basic stitches, one used across Europe, Australia, India and other crocheting nations, the other in the US and Canada. (In America, international terminology is often erroneously called British or UK terminology.)
Crochet is traditionally worked from a written pattern using standard abbreviations or from a diagram, thus enabling non-English speakers to use English-based patterns. To help counter confusion when reading patterns, a diagramming system using a standard international notation has come into use (illustration, left). In the United States, crochet terminology and sizing guidelines, as well as standards for yarn and hook labeling, are primarily regulated by the Craft Yarn Council.

Another terminological difference is known as &quot;tension&quot; (international) and &quot;gauge&quot; (US). Individual crocheters work yarn with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have the same number of stitches. In order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook.

==Differences and similarities to knitting==

One of the more obvious differences is that crochet uses one hook while most knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (except Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a knitted fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch is supported by the corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below. In contrast, crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed
Round or cylindrical patterns are simple to produce with a regular crochet hook, but cylindrical knitting requires either a set of circular needles or three to five special double-ended needles. Many crocheted items are composed of individual motifs which are then joined, either by sewing or crocheting, whereas knitting is usually composed of one fabric, such as entrelac.

Freeform crochet is a technique that can create interesting shapes in three dimensions because new stitches can be made independently of previous stitches almost anywhere in the crocheted piece. It is generally accomplished by building shapes or structural elements onto existing crocheted fabric at any place the crafter desires.

Knitting can be accomplished by machine, while many crochet stitches can only be crafted by hand. The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the height of a knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the height of a knit stitch.

While most crochet is made with a hook, there is also a method of crocheting with a knitting loom. This is called &quot;loomchet&quot;. Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, purls, and cables, and get a similar result.

It is a common perception that crochet produces a thicker fabric than knitting, tends to have less &quot;give&quot; than knitted fabric, and uses approximately a third more yarn for a comparable project than knitted items. Although this is true when comparing a single crochet swatch with a stockinette swatch, both made with the same size yarn and needle/hook, it is not necessarily true for crochet in general. Most crochet uses far less than 1/3 more yarn than knitting for comparable pieces, and a crocheter can get similar feel and drape to knitting by using a larger hook or thinner yarn. Tunisian crochet and slip stitch crochet can in some cases use less yarn than knitting for comparable pieces. According to sources claiming to have tested the 1/3 more yarn assertion, a single crochet stitch (sc) uses approximately the same amount of yarn as knit garter stitch, but more yarn than stockinette stitch. Any stitch using yarnovers uses less yarn than single crochet to produce the same amount of fabric. Cluster stitches, which are in fact multiple stitches worked together, will use the most length.

Standard crochet stitches like sc and dc also produce a thicker fabric, more like knit garter stitch. This is part of why they use more yarn. Slip stitch can produce a fabric much like stockinette that is thinner and therefore uses less yarn.

Any yarn can be either knitted or crocheted, provided needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord&#x27;s properties should be taken into account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.

==Craftivism==
It has been very common for people and groups to crochet clothing and other garments and then donate them to soldiers during war. People have also crocheted clothing and then donated it to hospitals, for sick patients and also for newborn babies. Sometimes groups will crochet for a specific charity purpose, such as crocheting for homeless shelters, nursing homes, etc.

It is becoming increasingly popular to crochet hats (commonly referred to as &quot;chemo caps&quot;) and donate them to cancer treatment centers, for those undergoing chemotherapy and therefore losing hair. During October pink hats and scarves are made and proceeds are donated to breast cancer funds. Organizations dedicated to using crochet as a way to help others include Knots of Love, Crochet for Cancer, and Soldiers&#x27; Angels. These organizations offer warm useful items for people in need.

In 2020, people around the world banded together to help save the wildlife affected by the Australian bushfires by crocheting kangaroo pouches, koala mittens, and wildlife nests. This was an international effort to help during the particularly bad bushfire season which devastated local ecological systems.

A group started in 2005 to create crochet versions of coral reefs grew by 2022 to over 20,000 contributors in what became the Crochet Coral Reef Project. To promote awareness of the effects of global warming, their creations have been displayed in galleries and museums by an estimated 2 million people. Many creations apply hyperbolic (curved) geometric shapes—distinguished from Euclidean (flat) geometry—to emulate natural structures. Extending hyperbolic crochet for activism and education with color, a group of South African crafters created &quot;The Abundance Crochet Coral Reef&quot;, an eco-art installation in Cape Town&#x27;s Two Oceans Aquarium, to juxtapose hyperbolic shapes crocheted in variations of white on one side of a display with fiber coral shapes crocheted in various colors to illustrate coral bleaching due to oceanic warming and climate change. 

Feminist scholar-activists have argued for crochet as an embodied method of inquiry aimed at uncovering entangled, relational, and situated ways being and knowing inclusive of the more-than-human co-creation of worlds. In &quot;Staying with the Trouble&quot;, Donna Haraway argues for the methodological use of crochet to model ecological and mathematical phenomena as &quot;a kind of lure to an affective cognitive ecology stitched in fiber arts&quot; that works &quot;not by mimicry, but by open-ended, exploratory process.&quot;

==Yarn bombing==

In recent years, a practice called yarn bombing, or the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one&#x27;s (usually outdoor) surroundings, emerged in the US and spread worldwide. Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification. In 2010, an entity dubbed &quot;the Midnight Knitter&quot; hit West Cape May. Residents awoke to find knit cozies hugging tree branches and sign poles. In September 2015, Grace Brett was named &quot;The World&#x27;s Oldest Yarn Bomber&quot;. She is part of a group of yarn graffiti-artists called the Souter Stormers, who beautify their local town in Scotland.

==Mathematics and hyperbolic crochet==
Crochet has been used to illustrate shapes in hyperbolic space that are difficult to reproduce using other media or are difficult to understand when viewed two-dimensionally. Mathematician Daina Taimiņa first used crochet in 1997 to create strong, durable models of hyperbolic space after finding paper models were delicate and hard to create. These models enable one to turn, fold, and otherwise manipulate space to more fully grasp ideas such as how a line can appear curved in hyperbolic space yet actually be straight. Her work received an exhibition by the Institute For Figuring.
Examples in nature of organisms that show hyperbolic structures include lettuces, sea slugs, flatworms and coral. Margaret Wertheim and Christine Wertheim of the Institute For Figuring created a traveling art installation of a coral reef using Taimina&#x27;s method. Local artists are encouraged to create their own &quot;satellite reefs&quot; to be included alongside the original display. As hyperbolic and mathematics-based crochet has become more popular, there have been several events highlighting work from various fiber artists. Two shows were &quot;Sant Ocean Hall&quot; at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., and &quot;Sticks, Hooks, and the Mobius: Knit and Crochet Go Cerebral&quot; at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania.

==Architecture==

In &quot;Style in the technical arts&quot;, Gottfried Semper looks at the textile with great promise and historical precedent. In Section 53, he writes of the &quot;loop stitch, or Noeud Coulant: a knot that, if untied, causes the whole system to unravel.&quot; In the same section, Semper confesses his ignorance of the subject of crochet but believes strongly that it is a technique of great value as a textile technique and possibly something more.

There are a small number of architects currently interested in the subject of crochet as it relates to architecture. The following publications, explorations and thesis projects can be used as a resource to see how crochet is being used within the capacity of architecture.

<doc id="7425" wikidata="Q2981904" url="?curid=7425" title="Electromagnetic coil">
<text>An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a (spiral or helix). Electromagnetic coils are used in electrical engineering, in applications where electric currents interact with magnetic fields, in devices such as electric motors, generators, inductors, electromagnets, transformers, sensor coils such as in medical MRI imaging machines. Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field, or conversely, an external &quot;time-varying&quot; magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an EMF (voltage) in the conductor.

A current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to Ampere&#x27;s law. The advantage of using the coil shape is that it increases the strength of the magnetic field produced by a given current. The magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add (superpose) to produce a strong field there. The greater the number of turns of wire, the stronger the field produced. Conversely, a &quot;changing&quot; external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.

The direction of the magnetic field produced by a coil can be determined by the right hand grip rule. If the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the magnetic core of a coil in the direction of conventional current through the wire, the thumb will point in the direction the magnetic field lines pass through the coil. The end of a magnetic core from which the field lines emerge is defined to be the North pole.

There are many different types of coils used in electric and electronic equipment.

==Windings and taps==

The wire or conductor which constitutes the coil is called the winding. The hole in the center of the coil is called the core area or &quot;magnetic axis&quot;. Each loop of wire is called a turn. In windings in which the turns touch, the wire must be insulated with a coating of nonconductive insulation such as plastic or enamel to prevent the current from passing between the wire turns. The winding is often wrapped around a &quot;coil form&quot; made of plastic or other material to hold it in place. The ends of the wire are brought out and attached to an external circuit. Windings may have additional electrical connections along their length; these are called taps. A winding that has a single tap in the center of its length is called center-tapped.

Coils can have more than one winding, insulated electrically from each other. When there are two or more windings around a common magnetic axis, the windings are said to be inductively coupled or magnetically coupled. A time-varying current through one winding will create a time-varying magnetic field that passes through the other winding, which will induce a time-varying voltage in the other windings. This is called a transformer. The winding to which current is applied, which creates the magnetic field, is called the &quot;primary winding&quot;. The other windings are called &quot;secondary windings&quot;.

==Magnetic core==
Many electromagnetic coils have a magnetic core, a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron in the center to increase the magnetic field. The current through the coil magnetizes the iron, and the field of the magnetized material adds to the field produced by the wire. This is called a ferromagnetic-core or iron-core coil. A ferromagnetic core can increase the magnetic field and inductance of a coil by hundreds or thousands of times over what it would be without the core. A ferrite core coil is a variety of coil with a core made of ferrite, a ferrimagnetic ceramic compound. Ferrite coils have lower core losses at high frequencies.
*A coil with a core which forms a closed loop, possibly with some narrow air gaps, is called a closed-core coil. By providing a closed path for the magnetic field lines, this geometry minimizes the magnetic reluctance and produces the strongest magnetic field. It is often used in transformers.
**A common form for closed-core coils is a toroidal core coil, in which the core has the shape of a torus or doughnut, with either a circular or rectangular cross section. This geometry has minimum leakage flux and radiates minimum electromagnetic interference (EMI).
*A coil with a core which is a straight bar or other non-loop shape is called an open-core coil. This has lower magnetic field and inductance than a closed core, but is often used to prevent magnetic saturation of the core.
A coil without a ferromagnetic core is called an air-core coil. This includes coils wound on plastic or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as coils which actually have empty air space inside their windings.

==Types of coils==
Coils can be classified by the frequency of the current they are designed to operate with:
:*&quot;Direct current&quot; or &quot;DC&quot; coils or electromagnets operate with a steady direct current in their windings 
:*&quot;Audio-frequency&quot; or &quot;AF&quot; coils, inductors or transformers operate with alternating currents in the audio frequency range, less than 20 kHz
:*&quot;Radio-frequency&quot; or &quot;RF&quot; coils, inductors or transformers operate with alternating currents in the radio frequency range, above 20 kHz

Coils can be classified by their function:

===Electromagnets===

Electromagnets are coils that generate a magnetic field for some external use, often to exert a mechanical force on something. or remove existing background fields. A few specific types:
:*Solenoid - an electromagnet in the form of a straight hollow helix of wire
:*Motor and generator windings - iron core electromagnets on the rotor or stator of electric motors and generators which act on each other to either turn the shaft (motor) or generate an electric current (generator)
:**Field winding - an iron-core coil which generates a steady magnetic field to act on the armature winding.
:**Armature winding - an iron-core coil which is acted on by the magnetic field of the field winding to either create torque (motor) or induce a voltage to produce power (generator)
:*Helmholtz coil, Maxwell coil - air-core coils which serve to cancel an external magnetic field
:*Degaussing coil - a coil used to demagnetize parts
:*Voice coil - a coil used in a moving-coil loudspeaker, suspended between the poles of a magnet. When the audio signal is passed through the coil, it vibrates, moving the attached speaker cone to create sound waves. The reverse is used in a dynamic microphone, where sound vibrations intercepted by something like a diaphragm physically transfer to a voice coil immersed in a magnetic field, and the coil&#x27;s terminal ends then provide an electric analog of those vibrations.

===Inductors===

Inductors or reactors are coils which generate a magnetic field which interacts with the coil itself, to induce a back EMF which opposes changes in current through the coil. Inductors are used as circuit elements in electrical circuits, to temporarily store energy or resist changes in current. A few types:

:*Tank coil - an inductor used in a tuned circuit
:*Choke - an inductor used to block high frequency AC while allowing through low frequency AC or DC.
:*Loading coil - an inductor used to add inductance to an antenna, to make it resonant, or to a cable to prevent distortion of signals.
:*Variometer - an adjustable inductor consisting of two coils in series, an outer stationary coil and a second one inside it which can be rotated so their magnetic axes are in the same direction or opposed.
:*Flyback transformer - Although called a transformer, this is actually an inductor which serves to store energy in switching power supplies and horizontal deflection circuits for CRT televisions and monitors
:*Saturable reactor - an iron-core inductor used to control AC power by varying the saturation of the core using a DC control voltage in an auxiliary winding.
:*Inductive ballast - an inductor used in gas-discharge lamp circuits, such as fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the lamp.
===Transformers===

A transformer is a device with two or more magnetically coupled windings (or sections of a single winding). A time varying current in one coil (called the primary winding) generates a magnetic field which induces a voltage in the other coil (called the secondary winding). A few types:
:*Distribution transformer - A transformer in an electric power grid which transforms the high voltage from the electric power line to the lower voltage used by utility customers.
:*Autotransformer - a transformer with only one winding. Different portions of the winding, accessed with taps, act as primary and secondary windings of the transformer.
:*Toroidal transformer - the core is in the shape of a toroid. This is a commonly used shape as it decreases the leakage flux, resulting in less electromagnetic interference.
:*Induction coil or trembler coil - an early transformer which uses a vibrating interrupter mechanism to break the primary current so it can operate off of DC current. 
:**Ignition coil - an induction coil used in internal combustion engines to create a pulse of high voltage to fire the spark plug which initiates the fuel burning.
:*Balun - a transformer which matches a balanced transmission line to an unbalanced one.
:*Bifilar coil - a coil wound with two parallel, closely spaced strands. If AC currents are passed through it in the same direction, the magnetic fluxes will add, but if equal currents in opposite directions pass through the windings the opposite fluxes will cancel, resulting in zero flux in the core. So no voltage will be induced in a third winding on the core. These are used in instruments and in devices like Ground Fault Interrupters. They are also used in low inductance wirewound resistors for use at RF frequencies.
:*Audio transformer - A transformer used with audio signals. They are used for impedance matching.
:**Hybrid coil - a specialized audio transformer with 3 windings used in telephony circuits to convert between two-wire and four-wire circuits
===Electric machines===
Electric machines such as motors and generators have one or more windings which interact with moving magnetic fields to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. Often a machine will have one winding through which passes most of the power of the machine (the &quot;armature&quot;), and a second winding which provides the magnetic field of the rotating element ( the &quot;field winding&quot;) which may be connected by brushes or slip rings to an external source of electric current. In an induction motor, the &quot;field&quot; winding of the rotor is energized by the slow relative motion between the rotating winding and the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator winding, which induces the necessary exciting current in the rotor.

===Transducer coils===

These are coils used to translate time-varying magnetic fields to electric signals, and vice versa. A few types:
:*Sensor or pickup coils - these are used to detect external time-varying magnetic fields 
:*Inductive sensor - a coil which senses when a magnet or iron object passes near it 
:*Recording head - a coil which is used to create a magnetic field to write data to a magnetic storage medium, such as magnetic tape, or a hard disk. Conversely it is also used to read the data in the form of changing magnetic fields in the medium.
:*Induction heating coil - an AC coil used to heat an object by inducing eddy currents in it, a process called induction heating.
:*Loop antenna - a coil which serves as a radio antenna, to convert radio waves to electric currents. 
:*Rogowski coil - a toroidal coil used as an AC measuring device
:*Musical instrument pickup - a coil used to produce the output audio signal in an electric guitar or electric bass.
:*Flux gate - a sensor coil used in a magnetometer
:*Magnetic phonograph cartridge - a sensor in a record player that uses a coil to translate vibration of a needle to an audio signal in playing vinyl phonograph records.

There are also types of coil which don&#x27;t fit into these categories.

<doc id="7426" wikidata="Q81506" url="?curid=7426" title="Charles I of England">
<text>Charles I (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649) was King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.

Charles was born into the House of Stuart as the second son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1612 upon the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to Infanta Maria Anna of Spain culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiation. Two years later, shortly after his accession, he married Henrietta Maria of France.

After his accession in 1625, Charles quarrelled with the English Parliament, which sought to curb his royal prerogative. He believed in the divine right of kings and was determined to govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without Parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated antipathy and mistrust from Reformed religious groups such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church Anglican ecclesiastics and failed to aid continental Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops&#x27; Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments, and helped precipitate his own downfall.

From 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645 at the hands of the Parliamentarian New Model Army, he fled north from his base at Oxford. Charles surrendered to a Scottish force and, after lengthy negotiations between the English and Scottish parliaments, was handed over to the Long Parliament in London. Charles refused to accept his captors&#x27; demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, he forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648, the New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and the Commonwealth of England was established as a republic. The monarchy was restored in 1660, with Charles&#x27;s son Charles II as king.

==Early life==
The second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in Dunfermline Palace, Fife, on 19 November 1600. At a Protestant ceremony in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, and created Duke of Albany, the traditional title of the second son of the king of Scotland, with the subsidiary titles of Marquess of Ormond, Earl of Ross and Lord Ardmannoch.

James VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and when she died childless in March 1603, he became king of England as James I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant, and while his parents and older siblings left for England in April and early June that year, due to his fragile health, he remained in Scotland with his father&#x27;s friend Lord Fyvie appointed as his guardian.

By 1604, when Charles was three-and-a-half, he was able to walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, he left Dunfermline for England, where he was to spend most of the rest of his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help strengthen his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he had a stammer for the rest of his life.

In January 1605, Charles was created Duke of York, as is customary in the case of the English sovereign&#x27;s second son, and made a Knight of the Bath. Thomas Murray, a presbyterian Scot, was appointed as a tutor. Charles learnt the usual subjects of classics, languages, mathematics and religion. In 1611, he was made a Knight of the Garter.

Eventually, Charles apparently conquered his physical infirmity, which might have been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. But in early November 1612, Henry died at the age of 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, he automatically gained several titles, including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay. In November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.

==Heir apparent==
In 1613, Charles&#x27;s sister Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and moved to Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The next year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian Diet chose Frederick, who led the Protestant Union, as their monarch, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick&#x27;s acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the Emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, King Frederick was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between Prince Charles and Ferdinand&#x27;s niece, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.

Unfortunately for James, negotiation with Spain proved unpopular with both the public and James&#x27;s court. The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of recusancy laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. James&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon, was impeached before the House of Lords for corruption. The impeachment was the first since 1459 without the King&#x27;s official sanction in the form of a bill of attainder. The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Archbishop William Laud, and Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons&#x27; walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant princess of Wales. Like his father, Charles considered discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father&#x27;s royal prerogative. In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members&#x27; impudence and intransigence.

Charles and Buckingham, James&#x27;s favourite and a man who had great influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. The trip was an embarrassing failure. The &quot;infanta&quot; thought Charles little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Catholicism as a condition of the match. They insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the English penal laws, which Charles knew Parliament would not agree to, and that the &quot;infanta&quot; remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the treaty&#x27;s terms. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When he returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed the reluctant James to declare war on Spain.

With the encouragement of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 to request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and quickly fell in much the same manner Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned Charles that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An underfunded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.

By 1624, the increasingly ill James was finding it difficult to control Parliament. By the time of his death in March 1625, Charles and Buckingham had already assumed &quot;de facto&quot; control of the kingdom.

==Early reign==

With the failure of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their attention to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the 15-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of Notre Dame de Paris. He had seen her in Paris while en route to Spain. They met in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the marriage was consummated, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons opposed his marriage to a Catholic, fearing that he would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Charles told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, but promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that were used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side, because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.

Distrust of Charles&#x27;s religious policies increased with his support of a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet &quot;A New Gag for an Old Goose&quot; (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet &quot;A New Gag for the New Gospel&quot;, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that God preordained salvation and damnation. Anti-Calvinistsknown as Arminiansbelieved that people could accept or reject salvation by exercising free will. Arminian divines had been one of the few sources of support for Charles&#x27;s proposed Spanish marriage. With King James&#x27;s support, Montagu produced another pamphlet, &quot;Appello Caesarem&quot;, published in 1625 shortly after James&#x27;s death and Charles&#x27;s accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made him a royal chaplain, heightening many Puritans&#x27; suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid Catholicism&#x27;s resurgence.

Rather than direct involvement in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, an insufficient sum for Charles&#x27;s war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of tonnage and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading. Although no act of Parliament for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.

A poorly conceived and executed naval expedition against Spain under Buckingham&#x27;s leadership went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the Duke. In May 1626, Charles nominated Buckingham as Chancellor of Cambridge University in a show of support, and had two members who had spoken against BuckinghamDudley Digges and Sir John Eliotarrested at the door of the House. The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members, and after about a week in custody, both were released. On 12 June 1626, the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham, stating, &quot;We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from intermeddling with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given.&quot; Despite the protests, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.

Meanwhile, domestic quarrels between Charles and Henrietta Maria were souring the early years of their marriage. Disputes over her jointure, appointments to her household, and the practice of her religion culminated in the King expelling the vast majority of her French attendants in August 1626. Despite Charles&#x27;s agreement to provide the French with English ships as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria, in 1627 he launched an attack on the French coast to defend the Huguenots at La Rochelle. The action, led by Buckingham, was ultimately unsuccessful. Buckingham&#x27;s failure to protect the Huguenotsand his retreat from Saint-Martin-de-Réspurred Louis XIII&#x27;s siege of La Rochelle and furthered the English Parliament&#x27;s and people&#x27;s detestation of the Duke.

Charles provoked further unrest by trying to raise money for the war through a &quot;forced loan&quot;: a tax levied without parliamentary consent. In November 1627, the test case in the King&#x27;s Bench, the &quot;Five Knights&#x27; Case&quot;, found that the King had a prerogative right to imprison without trial those who refused to pay the forced loan. Summoned again in March 1628, Parliament adopted a Petition of Right on 26 May, calling upon Charles to acknowledge that he could not levy taxes without Parliament&#x27;s consent, impose martial law on civilians, imprison them without due process, or quarter troops in their homes. Charles assented to the petition on 7 June, but by the end of the month he had prorogued Parliament and reasserted his right to collect customs duties without authorisation from Parliament.

On 23 August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated. Charles was deeply distressed. According to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, he &quot;threw himself upon his bed, lamenting with much passion and with abundance of tears&quot;. He remained grieving in his room for two days. In contrast, the public rejoiced at Buckingham&#x27;s death, accentuating the gulf between the court and the nation and between the Crown and the Commons. Buckingham&#x27;s death effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue, but it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament. It did, however, coincide with an improvement in Charles&#x27;s relationship with his wife, and by November 1628 their old quarrels were at an end. Perhaps Charles&#x27;s emotional ties were transferred from Buckingham to Henrietta Maria. She became pregnant for the first time, and the bond between them grew stronger. Together, they embodied an image of virtue and family life, and their court became a model of formality and morality.

==Personal rule==
===Parliament prorogued===
In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles&#x27;s policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. This was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs and giving popular cause to their protest.

Personal rule necessitated peace. Without the means in the foreseeable future to raise funds from Parliament for a European war, or Buckingham&#x27;s help, Charles made peace with France and Spain. The next 11 years, during which Charles ruled England without a Parliament, are known as the Personal Rule or the &quot;eleven years&#x27; tyranny&quot;. Ruling without Parliament was not exceptional, and was supported by precedent. But only Parliament could legally raise taxes, and without it Charles&#x27;s capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was limited to his customary rights and prerogatives.

===Finances===

A large fiscal deficit had arisen during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckingham&#x27;s short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, Charles had little financial capacity to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign, he was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister Elizabeth and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the &quot;Distraint of Knighthood&quot;, in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king&#x27;s coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined those who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626.

The chief tax Charles imposed was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than tonnage and poundage. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. But Charles argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but England&#x27;s 12 common law judges ruled the tax within the King&#x27;s prerogative, though some had reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges found against Hampden only by the narrow margin of 7–5.

Charles also derived money by granting monopolies, despite a statute forbidding such action, which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s. One such monopoly was for soap, pejoratively called &quot;popish soap&quot; because some of its backers were Catholics. Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation (1625), whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent. In addition, the boundaries of the royal forests in England were restored to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the reasserted boundaries for encroachment. The programme&#x27;s focus was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for conversion to pasture and arable farming, or in the case of the Forest of Dean, development for the iron industry. Disafforestation frequently caused riots and disturbances, including those known as the Western Rising.

Against the background of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to him, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company&#x27;s stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.

==Religious conflicts==
Throughout Charles&#x27;s reign, the English Reformation was in the forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual&#x27;s ability to reject or accept salvation, which opponents viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Catholicism. Puritan reformers considered Charles too sympathetic to Arminianism, and opposed his desire to move the Church of England in a more traditional and sacramental direction. In addition, his Protestant subjects followed the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles&#x27;s diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.

In 1633, Charles appointed William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury. They initiated a series of reforms to promote religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed by the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, organising the internal architecture of English churches to emphasise the sacrament of the altar, and reissuing King James&#x27;s Declaration of Sports, which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. The Feoffees for Impropriations, an organisation that bought benefices and advowsons so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. Laud prosecuted those who opposed his reforms in the Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, the two most powerful courts in the land. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views and unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. For example, in 1637 William Prynne, Henry Burton and John Bastwick were pilloried, whipped and mutilated by cropping and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets.

When Charles attempted to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from it; his first visit since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted using the Anglican rite. In 1637, he ordered the use of a new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk. Although it had been written, under Charles&#x27;s direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing it as a vehicle to introduce Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, riots erupted in Edinburgh on the first Sunday of the prayer book&#x27;s usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished episcopal church government, and adopted presbyterian government by elders and deacons.

===Bishops&#x27; Wars===

Charles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops&#x27; War in 1639. He did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, instead raising an army without parliamentary aid and marching to Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the Scottish border. The army did not engage the Covenanters, as the King feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters&#x27; interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.

The military failure in the First Bishops&#x27; War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives led to the public humiliation of the Battle of the Downs, where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet off the coast of Kent in sight of the impotent English navy.

Charles continued peace negotiations with the Scots in a bid to gain time before launching a new military campaign. Because of his financial weakness, he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture. Both the English and Irish parliaments were summoned in the early months of 1640. In March 1640, the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May. But in the English general election in March, court candidates fared badly, and Charles&#x27;s dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate. The earls of Northumberland and Strafford attempted to broker a compromise whereby the King would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £650,000 (although the cost of the coming war was estimated at £1 million). Nevertheless, this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons. The Parliamentarians&#x27; calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still retained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of the Earl of Northumberland, the Short Parliament (as it came to be known) was dissolved in May 1640, less than a month after it assembled.

By this stage the Earl of Strafford, Lord Deputy of Ireland since 1632, had emerged as Charles&#x27;s right-hand man and, together with Archbishop Laud, pursued a policy that he termed &quot;Thorough&quot;, which aimed to make central royal authority more efficient and effective at the expense of local or anti-government interests. Although originally a critic of the King, Strafford defected to royal service in 1628, in part due to the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s persuasion, and had since emerged, alongside Laud, as the most influential of Charles&#x27;s ministers.

Bolstered by the failure of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament declared itself capable of governing without the King&#x27;s consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of Lord Northumberland, who was the King&#x27;s commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, had far greater morale and training than their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring County Palatine of Durham.

As demands for a parliament grew, Charles took the unusual step of summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. This stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day indefinitely until a final settlement was negotiated and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, his supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, more than 350 opposed the King.

==Long Parliament==

===Tensions escalate===

The Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the King&#x27;s leading counsellors for high treason. Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the next day, and fled to The Hague with Charles&#x27;s permission on 21 December. To prevent the King from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the King failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.

Strafford had become the principal target of the Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, and he went on trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. But Sir Henry Vane&#x27;s key allegation that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated, and on 10 April Pym&#x27;s case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.

Charles assured Strafford that &quot;upon the word of a king you shall not suffer in life, honour or fortune&quot;, and the attainder could not succeed if Charles withheld assent. Furthermore, many members and most peers opposed the attainder, not wishing, in the words of one, to &quot;commit murder with the sword of justice&quot;. But increased tensions and an attempted coup by royalist army officers in support of Strafford and in which Charles was involved began to sway the issue. The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a large margin (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 230 abstained), and the Lords acquiesced (by 26 votes to 19, with 79 absent) in May. On 3 May, Parliament&#x27;s Protestation attacked the &quot;wicked counsels&quot; of Charles&#x27;s &quot;arbitrary and tyrannical government&quot;. While those who signed the petition undertook to defend the King&#x27;s &quot;person, honour and estate&quot;, they also swore to preserve &quot;the true reformed religion&quot;, Parliament, and the &quot;rights and liberties of the subjects&quot;. Fearing for his family&#x27;s safety in the face of unrest, Charles reluctantly assented to Strafford&#x27;s attainder on 9 May after consulting his judges and bishops. Strafford was beheaded three days later.

Also in early May, Charles assented to an unprecedented Act that forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.

Charles had made important concessions in England, and temporarily improved his position in Scotland by signing a final settlement of the Bishops&#x27; Wars, then securing the Scots&#x27; favour on a visit from August to November 1641 during which he conceded to the official establishment of presbyterianism in Scotland. But after an attempted royalist coup in Scotland, known as the Incident, Charles&#x27;s credibility was significantly undermined.

===Irish rebellion===
Ireland&#x27;s population was split into three main sociopolitical groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford&#x27;s administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the King and weakened the Irish Parliament&#x27;s authority, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford&#x27;s impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the King had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the King was directly involved in governance.

Strafford&#x27;s fall from power weakened Charles&#x27;s influence in Ireland. The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford&#x27;s imprisonment, until lack of money eventually forced Charles to disband the army at the end of Strafford&#x27;s trial. Disputes over the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the King.

In November 1641, the House of Commons passed the Grand Remonstrance, a long list of grievances against actions by Charles&#x27;s ministers committed since the beginning of his reign (that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy of which the King was an unwitting member), but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes, 159 to 148. Furthermore, the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords, which the Remonstrance attacked. The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion, coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charles&#x27;s complicity. Throughout November, a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland, including massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords. Rumours of &quot;papist&quot; conspiracies circulated in England, and English anti-Catholic opinion was strengthened, damaging Charles&#x27;s reputation and authority. The English Parliament distrusted Charles&#x27;s motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons suspected that forces he raised might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym&#x27;s Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the King, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the King. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into lawlessness, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, he decided to take drastic action.

===Five members===
Charles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five specific members of the Commons—Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig—and one peer, Lord Mandeville, on the grounds of high treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which he resolved to do personally. But news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January. Having displaced Speaker William Lenthall from his chair, the King asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, famously replied, &quot;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.&quot; Charles abjectly declared &quot;all my birds have flown&quot;, and was forced to retire empty-handed.

The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters&#x27; efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.

Parliament quickly seized London, and Charles fled the capital for Hampton Court Palace on 10 January, moving two days later to Windsor Castle. After sending his wife and eldest daughter to safety abroad in February, he travelled northwards, hoping to seize the military arsenal at Hull. To his dismay, he was rebuffed by the town&#x27;s Parliamentary governor, Sir John Hotham, who refused him entry in April, and Charles was forced to withdraw.

==English Civil War==


In mid-1642, both sides began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method of commission of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. The negotiations proved futile, and Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. By then, his forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at Oxford. Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.

After a few skirmishes, the opposing forces met in earnest at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles&#x27;s nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine disagreed with the battle strategy of the royalist commander Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth. Rupert&#x27;s cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.

In his own words, the experience of battle had left Charles &quot;exceedingly and deeply grieved&quot;. He regrouped at Oxford, turning down Rupert&#x27;s suggestion of an immediate attack on London. After a week, he set out for the capital on 3 November, capturing Brentford on the way while simultaneously continuing to negotiate with civic and parliamentary delegations. At Turnham Green on the outskirts of London, the royalist army met resistance from the city militia, and faced with a numerically superior force, Charles ordered a retreat. He overwintered in Oxford, strengthening the city&#x27;s defences and preparing for the next season&#x27;s campaign. Peace talks between the two sides collapsed in April.

The war continued indecisively over the next couple of years, and Henrietta Maria returned to Britain for 17 months from February 1643. After Rupert captured Bristol in July 1643, Charles visited the port city and laid siege to Gloucester, further up the river Severn. His plan to undermine the city walls failed due to heavy rain, and on the approach of a parliamentary relief force, Charles lifted the siege and withdrew to Sudeley Castle. The parliamentary army turned back towards London, and Charles set off in pursuit. The two armies met at Newbury, Berkshire, on 20 September. Just as at Edgehill, the battle stalemated at nightfall, and the armies disengaged. In January 1644, Charles summoned a Parliament at Oxford, which was attended by about 40 peers and 118 members of the Commons; all told, the Oxford Parliament, which sat until March 1645, was supported by the majority of peers and about a third of the Commons. Charles became disillusioned by the assembly&#x27;s ineffectiveness, calling it a &quot;mongrel&quot; in private letters to his wife.

In 1644, Charles remained in the southern half of England while Rupert rode north to relieve Newark and York, which were under threat from parliamentary and Scottish Covenanter armies. Charles was victorious at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge in late June, but the royalists in the north were defeated at the Battle of Marston Moor just a few days later. The King continued his campaign in the south, encircling and disarming the parliamentary army of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. Returning northwards to his base at Oxford, he fought at Newbury for a second time before the winter closed in; the battle ended indecisively. Attempts to negotiate a settlement over the winter, while both sides rearmed and reorganised, were again unsuccessful.

At the Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, Rupert&#x27;s horsemen again mounted a successful charge against the flank of Parliament&#x27;s New Model Army, but elsewhere on the field, opposing forces pushed Charles&#x27;s troops back. Attempting to rally his men, Charles rode forward, but as he did so, Robert Dalzell, 1st Earl of Carnwath seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the King&#x27;s safety. The royalist soldiers misinterpreted Carnwath&#x27;s action as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. The military balance tipped decisively in Parliament&#x27;s favour. There followed a series of defeats for the royalists, and then the siege of Oxford, from which Charles escaped (disguised as a servant) in April 1646. He put himself into the hands of the Scottish Presbyterian army besieging Newark, and was taken northwards to Newcastle upon Tyne. After nine months of negotiations, the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament: in exchange for £100,000, and the promise of more money in the future, the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647.

===Captivity===
Parliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army. By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by congregationalist Independents, who sought a greater political role. Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce&#x27;s actions as an opportunity rather than a threat. He was taken first to Newmarket, at his own suggestion, and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court, while more fruitless negotiations took place. By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape—perhaps to France, Southern England or Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border. He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond, Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic. But Hammond confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody.

From Carisbrooke, Charles continued to try to bargain with the various parties. In direct contrast to his previous conflict with the Scottish Kirk, on 26 December 1647 he signed a secret treaty with the Scots. Under the agreement, called the &quot;Engagement&quot;, the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles&#x27;s behalf and restore him to the throne on condition that Presbyterianism be established in England for three years.

The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the Second Civil War, and as agreed with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in Kent, Essex, and Cumberland, and a rebellion in South Wales, were put down by the New Model Army, and with the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648, the royalists lost any chance of winning the war.

Charles&#x27;s only recourse was to return to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the King, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed in the custody of the army the following day. In Pride&#x27;s Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.

==Trial==

Charles was moved to Hurst Castle at the end of 1648, and thereafter to Windsor Castle. In January 1649, the Rump Parliament House of Commons indicted him for treason; however, the House of Lords rejected the charge. The idea of trying a king was novel. The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England—Henry Rolle, Oliver St John and John Wilde—all opposed the indictment as unlawful. 

The Rump Commons declared itself capable of legislating alone, passed a bill creating a separate court for Charles&#x27;s trial, and declared the bill an act without the need for royal assent. The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 commissioners, but many either refused to serve or chose to stay away. Only 68 (all firm Parliamentarians) attended Charles&#x27;s trial on charges of high treason and &quot;other high crimes&quot; that began on 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall. John Bradshaw acted as President of the Court, and the prosecution was led by Solicitor General John Cook.

Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of the country. The charge stated that he was devising &quot;a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people&quot;. In carrying this out he had &quot;traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented&quot;, and that the &quot;wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the said Charles Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation.&quot; 

Presaging the modern concept of command responsibility, the indictment held him &quot;guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby.&quot; An estimated 300,000 people, or 6% of the population, died during the war.

Over the first three days of the trial, whenever Charles was asked to plead, he refused, stating his objection with the words: &quot;I would know by what power I am called hither, by what lawful authority...?&quot; He claimed that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch, that his own authority to rule had been given to him by God and by the traditional laws of England, and that the power wielded by those trying him was only that of force of arms. Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining that, The court, by contrast, challenged the doctrine of sovereign immunity and proposed that &quot;the King of England was not a person, but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern &#x27;by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise&#x27;.&quot;

At the end of the third day, Charles was removed from the court, which then heard more than 30 witnesses against him in his absence over the next two days, and on 26 January condemned him to death. The next day, the King was brought before a public session of the commission, declared guilty, and sentenced. The judgement read, &quot;For all which treasons and crimes this court doth adjudge that he, the said Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy to the good people of this nation, shall be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.&quot; Fifty-nine of the commissioners signed Charles&#x27;s death warrant.

==Execution==
Charles&#x27;s execution was scheduled for Tuesday, 30 January 1649. Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians: Elizabeth and Henry. They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. The next morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: &quot;the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear. I would have no such imputation.&quot;

He walked under guard from St James&#x27;s Palace, where he had been confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House. Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: &quot;An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me.&quot; He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, &quot;but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government ... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things.&quot; He continued, &quot;I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be.&quot;

At about 2:00 p.m., Charles put his head on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by stretching out his hands; he was then beheaded in one clean stroke. According to observer Philip Henry, a moan &quot;as I never heard before and desire I may never hear again&quot; rose from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the King&#x27;s blood as a memento.

The executioner was masked and disguised, and there is debate over his identity. The commissioners approached Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200—a considerably large sum for the time. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but others have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the King&#x27;s body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.

It was common practice for the severed head of a traitor to be held up and exhibited to the crowd with the words &quot;Behold the head of a traitor!&quot; Charles&#x27;s head was exhibited, but those words were not used, possibly because the executioner did not want his voice recognised. On the day after the execution, the King&#x27;s head was sewn back onto his body, which was then embalmed and placed in a lead coffin.

The commission refused to allow Charles&#x27;s burial at Westminster Abbey, so his body was conveyed to Windsor on the night of 7 February. He was buried in private on 9 February 1649 in the Henry VIII vault in the chapel&#x27;s quire, alongside the coffins of Henry VIII and Henry&#x27;s third wife, Jane Seymour, in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The King&#x27;s son, Charles II, later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in Hyde Park, London, but it was never built.

==Legacy==

Ten days after Charles&#x27;s execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purportedly written by him appeared for sale. This book, the &quot;Eikon Basilike&quot; (Greek for the &quot;Royal Portrait&quot;), contained an &quot;apologia&quot; for royal policies, and proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda. John Milton wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the &quot;Eikonoklastes&quot; (&quot;The Iconoclast&quot;), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book. Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom, and in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660 King Charles the Martyr was added to the Church of England&#x27;s liturgical calendar. High church Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death. Churches, such as those at Falmouth and Tunbridge Wells, and Anglican devotional societies such as the Society of King Charles the Martyr, were founded in his honour.

With the monarchy overthrown, England became a republic or &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons, and a Council of State assumed executive power. All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the Anglo-Scottish War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653, thereby establishing the Protectorate with himself as Lord Protector. Upon his death in 1658, he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son, Richard. Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was restored to Charles I&#x27;s eldest son, Charles II, in 1660.

Charles&#x27;s unprecedented 1642 invasion of the House of Commons&#x27; chamber, a grave violation of the liberties of Parliament, and his unsuccessful attempt to arrest five Members of Parliament are commemorated annually at the State Opening of Parliament.

===Art===

Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Peter Paul Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as Gerard van Honthorst, Daniel Mytens, and Anthony van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, Andrea del Sarto and Andrea Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein the Younger, Wenceslaus Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles&#x27;s death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.

===Assessments===
In the words of John Philipps Kenyon, &quot;Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy&quot;. Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr, he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional. In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, the main exception being Kevin Sharpe, who offered a more sympathetic view that has not been widely adopted. Sharpe argued that the King was a dynamic man of conscience, but Barry Coward thought Charles &quot;the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI&quot;, a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him &quot;the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages&quot;.

Archbishop William Laud, whom Parliament beheaded during the war, called Charles a &quot;mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be, or how to be made, great.&quot; Charles was more sober and refined than his father, but he was intransigent. He deliberately pursued unpopular policies that brought ruin on himself. Both Charles and James were advocates of the divine right of kings, but while James&#x27;s ambitions concerning absolute prerogative were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles believed he had no need to compromise or even to explain his actions. He thought he was answerable only to God. &quot;Princes are not bound to give account of their actions,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but to God alone&quot;.

<text>Counter-Strike (also known as Half-Life: Counter-Strike or Counter-Strike 1.6) is a 2000 tactical first-person shooter game developed by Valve and published by both Valve and Sierra Studios. A team-based game, players assume the roles of counter-terrorist forces and terrorist militants opposing them.

Plans of a game based on counterterrorism were made in 1998 by Minh &quot;Gooseman&quot; Le and Jess &quot;Cliffe&quot; Cliffe, however actual development began the next year, with the first few betas being released. It resulted in increased popularity and interest and attracted Valve. They later acquired the game&#x27;s intellectual property and announced a partnership with Le and Cliffe. Following a series of updates, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was released by Valve for Microsoft Windows in November 2000, as the first installment in the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series. Several remakes and ports were released on Xbox, as well as OS X and Linux.

Upon release, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; received widespread acclaim for its tactical depth, teamwork emphasis, and fast-paced gameplay, although its graphics and technical issues were noted. The game became a major success, selling over 1.5 million copies by 2003, and grossing $40 million. By 2004, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; had earned $75 million, with the franchise ultimately selling over 25 million copies by 2008. Its success played a pivotal role in the rise of professional gaming and multiplayer FPS titles. 

Following the success of the original &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, several sequels and updates were released. &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot;, released in 2004, introduced a single-player campaign alongside enhanced multiplayer features. It was followed by &quot;Counter-Strike: Source&quot;, released the same year, which ran on Valve&#x27;s Source engine, offering improved graphics and physics. In 2012, &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; was launched, further expanding the series with new modes, maps, and improved matchmaking. The latest sequel, &quot;Counter-Strike 2&quot;, was released in 2023.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Counter-Strike&quot; is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game in which players can join either the terrorists (T) or the counter-terrorists (CT). If one team has more players than the other, the server settings may automatically balance. Each game begins with both teams spawning simultaneously as one of eight possible default character models (four each for counter-terrorist and terrorist). Each player begins with $800, two magazines of ammo, a knife, and a handgun: a Heckler &amp; Koch USP for the counter-terrorists or a Glock 18c for the terrorists. Players are usually allowed a few seconds before the round starts to purchase equipment but not move. Players may purchase equipment whenever they are in a buy zone for their team.

The scoreboard displays team results as well as information about each player, including their name, score, deaths, and ping/latency (ms) on the map, it also displays if each player is dead, carrying a bomb (in bomb defusal maps), or a VIP (in assassination maps), albeit the player must be killed during the round to gain this information about opposing team members. Players that are killed become &quot;ghosts&quot; for the rest of the round; they are unable to alter their names or receive chat/voice messages from live players, unless the console command sv_alltalk is set to 1. They may typically watch the rest of the round from a variety of chosen observer modes (free-look mode, locked chasecam and free chase chasecam), but some servers limit some of these views to prevent dead players from conveying information about surviving players to their teammates via alternate media (most notably voice in Internet cafés). Many players believe the practice known as &quot;ghosting&quot; to be cheating. Players receive standard bonuses, such as $3500 for winning a round, $1500 for losing one, and $300 for killing an enemy. They can have up to $16000 via earning and can be fined (e.g. killing a teammate fines the perpetrator $3300).

Currently, there are three objectives depending on the map:
:* Bomb defusal: The terrorist team has a bomb when the round starts. The goal of the terrorists is to plant the bomb at a bomb site—usually called Bombsite A or Bombsite B on the map—and make sure it explodes. The counter-terrorist team wins if they are able to defuse the bomb within a set time limit. If either team is eliminated before the bomb is planted, the other team wins. Bomb defusal maps start with the prefix &quot;de_&quot; (e.g de_dust2).
:* Hostage rescue: Four hostages are often located close to the terrorist base on the map. The goal of the counter-terrorists is to lead the captives to a location on the map where they are rescued. A team wins if every member of that team has been eliminated. The counter-terrorists win and get $2400 for each captive that survives, provided that the number of rescued hostages is at least half of the original hostage count. The terrorists win when the round ends. Maps with this objective start with the prefix &quot;cs_&quot; (e.g cs_office).
:* Assassination: In this objective, one counter-terrorist member becomes into a VIP, armed with 200 units of Kevlar vest and nothing more than the counter-terrorist standard-issue USP handgun and one additional magazine. Except for their own handgun, the VIP is not permitted to retrieve dropped firearms. The VIP&#x27;s goal is to get at an extraction zone (1, typically), which is when the counter-terrorists triumph. The terrorists win if the VIP dies. The counter-terrorists win if every terrorist dies, while the terrorists also win when time runs out. A VIP shouldn&#x27;t expect to escape without the team&#x27;s help due to the gun&#x27;s shortage of ammo, but the unique armor and the pistol together offer sufficient protection.
Formerly, there was a fourth objective called Escape. The scenario is that the terrorist team must &quot;escape&quot; to one of the designated escape points after beginning their mission in a protected area. Before they can flee, the counter-terrorist team needs to kill them. Once half of the team has managed to escape, the terrorists win the round. Following each of the eight rounds of play, the two sides will trade roles. If one team eliminates the other, both teams can also win the scenario.

Three categories exist for weapons: Melee (knife), Secondary (handguns), and Primary (rifles, shotguns, machine and submachine guns). There is a separate category for equipment like defusing kits and hand grenades. With the exception of equipment, which may hold many items at once, players are only allowed to carry one item in each of these categories at a time.

==Development==
Minh Le was previously involved in developing mods, such as &quot;Navy SEALs&quot; for &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Action Quake 2&quot;. However, seeking more control over development, he decided to create his own mod. Having already worked with the &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake 2&quot; engines, Le chose the GoldSrc engine as a natural progression. The &quot;Half-Life&quot; engine&#x27;s realistic setting made it well-suited for his concept of a mod involving terrorists and counter-terrorists. Development began in January 1999, but as the &quot;Half-Life&quot; software development kit (SDK) was not yet released, Le initially created new weapon and player models. In February 1999, the first screenshots of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; were released, accompanied by an interview about the mod. Le and Jess Cliffe, who had both worked on &quot;Action Quake 2&quot;, connected through an IRC chat, during which Le shared his idea for the mod. Cliffe, excited by the concept, offered to create a website for it, thus becoming involved in the project. 

Many movies served as sources of inspiration for prospective weapon candidates. For instance, the Krieg 552 and M249 were included in &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; due to inspiration from the 1998 film &quot;Ronin&quot;. Additionally, the films &quot;Air Force One&quot; and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; served as further influences for weapon selection. Gun magazines and the internet were key sources for the team to gather information about the actual firearms used in the game. A few weapon models in &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; deviate from their real-world counterparts because Minh Le, the game&#x27;s main developer, had to make assumptions about how certain weapons would behave during animation due to limited information. The weapons had to not only look and sound good but also feel satisfying to use. Realism, as well as the type of weapons the groups would likely use in real-life scenarios, were prioritized when selecting the weapons for the game.

On March 15, 1999, the mod received its name following an ICQ chat between Le and Cliffe. Le suggested names based on his favorite TV shows and movies, with options like &quot;Counterrorism&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Strike Force&quot;, &quot;FRAG HEADS&quot;, &quot;Counter-Terror&quot;, &quot;Terrorist Wars&quot;, &quot;Terror-Force&quot;, and &quot;Counter Force&quot;. They eventually chose &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; as the title. The official &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; website was launched on March 24, 1999. It was hosted by GameSpy&#x27;s Joost Schurr on Planet Half-Life. When the &quot;Half-Life&quot; SDK was released on April 7, 1999, mod development officially began. Although the mod had not been officially released, Minh Le&#x27;s reputation from his previous work on &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; sparked significant interest. The mod&#x27;s official website quickly attracted 10,000 visitors.

Le focused on the player models, taking him 40 hours for each one. Cliffe contributed to the game&#x27;s design, sound, art and public relations, while closely following the development of &quot;Half-Life&quot; and reading interviews with Gabe Newell.

In May 1999, the mod&#x27;s most pressing issue was a shortage of mappers. Despite several requests for mappers posted on the official website, the response was minimal. Cliffe began directly contacting &quot;Half-Life&quot; mappers. Jess Cliffe reached out to many people who had previously submitted maps to Radium, an old &quot;Half-Life&quot; mapping site. A contest was held to select maps for the initial beta, though some maps were discarded.

Before the first Beta&#x27;s official release, a pre-Beta build was leaked online, potentially accelerating the release of the mod. The first Beta, released on July 15, 1999, featured a hostage rescue scenario, 9 weapons, 4 maps, and one player model per side. Jess Cliffe reported that the release was well-received by the community. Beta 2 and Beta 3 followed, adding new weapons, maps, and factions. Beta 3 introduced a controversial change: the removal of frags from the scoreboard, a change later reversed. Beta 4 introduced the bomb defusal scenario, a significant new feature, and many map designs incorporated this scenario. The interest in the game drew numerous players to Cliffe&#x27;s website, which helped both him and Le to make revenue from advertisements hosted on the site. Another website related to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was launched by John &quot;Rizzuh&quot; Jensen as a source for information about the game, tactics, skins and sounds.

In late 1999, Minh Le began working at Barking Dog Studios while finishing his studies. When Valve Software learned of this, they asked Barking Dog to assist in developing Beta 5, offering to finance the project and acquire the game&#x27;s intellectual property. The development was mainly handled by Barking Dog, as Le was occupied with his university studies. Valve contributed by cleaning up code, fixing bugs, and enhancing the interface. New hostage models were introduced, and the development of the game was further supported with the release of Beta 5.2. With Beta 6.0, new scenarios, such as assassination and escape, were added. While assassination found moderate success, the escape scenario was later removed.

Following the acquisition of the game by Valve, while Cliffe continued working for them, Le did additional work towards a &quot;Counter-Strike 2.0&quot; based on Valve&#x27;s upcoming Source engine, but left to start his own studio after Valve opted to shelve the sequel.

==Release==
On April 12, 2000, Valve Software announced a partnership with the Counter-Strike Team, confirming that &quot;Counter-Strike 1.0&quot; would be included in an upcoming &quot;Half-Life&quot; patch. Though not explicitly stated, it is widely believed that this followed Valve&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. Statements suggest the rights were sold in early 2000, involving a financial transaction.

Despite the partnership, two more beta versions were released. Beta 6.5 (June 8, 2000) introduced an updated netcode, while Beta 7.0 (August 26, 2000) added driveable vehicles.

Valve planned to release &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; both as a Half-Life mod and a standalone retail product, scheduled for August 31, 2000. The decision aimed to increase accessibility and test market demand for a multiplayer game independent of &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Legal issues arose before the retail release, particularly regarding weapon names, which were changed to fictional alternatives. Valve also had to secure rights for maps and textures, leading to modifications and removals of certain assets. Minh Le, one of the original developers, compensated mappers whose work Valve did not purchase.

The retail version included new content, such as three additional weapons designed by Minh Le and updated player models provided by Valve. Maverick Developments created a training map for the retail edition. On November 9, 2000, Valve announced that the retail version had gone gold, and the mod version was released shortly after.

After launch, Valve continued releasing updates. Version 1.1 implemented a new spectator mode, version 1.3 introduced voice chat and version 1.4 added anti-cheat measures. &quot;Counter-Strike 1.5&quot;, released on June 12, 2002, was the last update before transitioning to Steam. &quot;Counter-Strike 1.6&quot; was the last major content update. While minor patches continued, plans for &quot;Counter-Strike 1.7&quot;—which aimed to merge the player bases of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Condition Zero&quot;—were never realized.

The game faced scrutiny in Germany after being linked to the Erfurt school massacre in 2002, as it was found on the computer of perpetrator Robert Steinhäuser. Politicians, including CSU&#x27;s Günther Beckstein, and media outlets, particularly Bild, popularized the term &quot;killer game&quot; in reference to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. Calls for banning violent video games intensified, with politicians like Beckstein advocating for penalties against users of such games. Media outlets like Frontal 21 on ZDF often portrayed players negatively.

In 2002, Germany&#x27;s BPjM considered indexing &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; but ultimately rejected it, concluding that the game&#x27;s objectives could be achieved without violence and that its communication aspects were beneficial. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder criticized the decision, citing it as irresponsible.

In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; for OS X and Linux, eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its retail release, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; received highly favorable reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that success in the game often relied on teamwork, with Scott Osborne stating, &quot;Despite simple mechanics, the focus on teamwork added depth and complexity.&quot; He also highlighted how decisions like purchasing weapons or saving money for future rounds could have a significant impact on match outcomes. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Clayton Wolfe praised the game for its strategic depth and intense, fast-paced action, as well as emphasizing the importance of the &quot;money system&quot; and stating, &quot;It encouraged teamwork by rewarding victories rather than individual kills.&quot;

&quot;GameRevolution&quot;″s Joe Dodson described the game as one of the top multiplayer titles of 2000, saying it was &quot;a man-eating leviathan,&quot; with a blend of realism and strategic gameplay. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s Bill Hiles referred to it as a &quot;phenomenon,&quot; noting its immense popularity and the intense atmosphere it created. He captured the game&#x27;s broad appeal by stating, &quot;The combination of action and strategy, with diverse map objectives like hostage rescue and bomb planting, contributed to its broad appeal.&quot;

However, some critics pointed out the dated visuals due to the &quot;Half-Life&quot; engine, which was already a couple of years old by the time &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was released. While this didn’t detract from the overall experience, it was mentioned as a limitation for players accustomed to newer graphical standards. Hiles acknowledged this by mentioning, &quot;There were some complaints about the character animations in the current version,&quot; with some models appearing &quot;awkwardly detailed.&quot; He also highlighted technical issues, such as clipping problems that caused &quot;odd behaviors&quot; with the characters.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; noted the steep learning curve for newcomers, with their review pointing out that the game&#x27;s complexity could be frustrating for new players. However, the review also stated, &quot;The game&#x27;s rewarding depth for those who invested time into mastering its mechanics&quot; made it an enduring experience. 

However, the Xbox edition of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; received mixed reviews, with many critics praising the core gameplay but highlighting several issues. As &quot;GameInformer&quot;″s Matthew Kato noted, the game’s single-player mode was a disappointment, reduced to battling bots. He stated, &quot;While the AI provides a decent learning experience, it lacks the depth and challenge of human opponents,&quot; and criticized the absence of a true campaign. However, he acknowledged the new maps and features like the riot shield, calling them a &quot;nice touch&quot; for fans. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin emphasized the strength of the game&#x27;s multiplayer, despite control limitations. He wrote, &quot;While the control scheme isn&#x27;t perfect for a fast-paced shooter, the game still captures the essence of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;″s team-based strategy.&quot; He also praised Xbox Live support, calling it &quot;a saving grace&quot; for the overall experience. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Aaron Boulding pointed out that the port was &quot;a faithful recreation of the PC mod&quot; but wasn&#x27;t a standout title for the console. He said the lack of a single-player campaign and key PC features were &quot;missed opportunities.&quot; Despite the issues, Boulding praised the multiplayer, saying it &quot;remained fun for fans of tactical team-based shooters.&quot;

The transition to console had its drawbacks. The Xbox version&#x27;s controls made precise aiming harder, and the graphics were a step down from the PC version, with Boulding calling them &quot;barely an upgrade.&quot; Despite these issues, the game&#x27;s addictive multiplayer kept it enjoyable, though it felt &quot;outdated&quot; compared to the PC version.

Despite these critiques, the game&#x27;s emphasis on teamwork, tactical depth, and strategic planning made it an influential title in the multiplayer FPS genre.
In 2003, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that E-Sports Entertainment ESEA League started the first professional fantasy e-sports league in 2004 with the game &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. Some credit the move into professional competitive team play with prizes as a major factor in &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; longevity and success.

===Sales===
&quot;Counter-Strike&quot; became the first fan-made video game to be released commercially. By July 2001, global retail sales of the game had surpassed 250,000 units. By October 2002, sales had exceeded 1.3 million copies. Sales continued to rise, reaching 1.5 million units and generating $40 million in revenue by February 2003.

By August 2004, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; had grossed $75 million in revenue and had an estimated two million players worldwide. In the United States, its retail version sold 550,000 copies and earned $15.7 million by August 2006, making it the 22nd best-selling PC game in the country between January 2000 and August 2006. The Xbox version of the game sold 1.5 million copies.

As of December 2008, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; had sold approximately 4.2 million copies, surpassing all other Valve games except &quot;Half-Life&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. The success of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; contributed to the overall franchise selling over 25 million copies.

A portion of &quot;Half-Life&quot; sales is often attributed to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; since the game was originally available as a modification of &quot;Half-Life&quot;. &quot;Half-Life&quot; experienced an unusual increase in sales year-over-year following its release, which Gabe Newell attributed to the popularity of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. He described the release of the mod as one of the best things that could have happened to &quot;Half-Life&quot;.

===Brazilian sale ban===
On January 17, 2008, a Brazilian federal court order prohibiting all sales of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;EverQuest&quot; began to be enforced. The federal Brazilian judge Carlos Alberto Simões de Tomaz ordered the ban in October 2007 because, as argued by the judge, the games &quot;bring imminent stimulus to the subversion of the social order, attempting against the democratic state and the law and against public security.&quot; As of June 18, 2009, a regional federal court order lifting the prohibition on the sale of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was published. The game is now being sold again in Brazil.

==Competitive play==
The original &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; has been played in competitive tournaments since 2000, with the first major event taking place at the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) Winter Championship in 2001. The CPL announced a transition from &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; to &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; for the Winter Championship. Prior to this, the 2000 Babbage&#x27;s event featured a Counter-Strike competition sponsored by Kärna, the parent company of Razer, offering a $15,000 prize pool. However, Kärna experienced financial difficulties, leading to delays in prize payouts. On March 14, 2001, the CPL issued a statement confirming that alternative arrangements would be made if the payments were not received by April 2, 2001.

On April 12, 2001, the CPL Winter Championship commenced at the Hyatt Regency in Dallas, Texas. The event featured 48 competing teams, marking the first large-scale &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament. The competition attracted over 800 attendees, including participants and Bring Your Own Computer (BYOC) players. Many professional &quot;Quake&quot; players were notably absent, while the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; community saw an influx of new competitors. This tournament was the largest &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; event at the time and contributed to the game&#x27;s rise in professional esports.

In 2003, the Esports World Convention (formerly known as the Electronic Sports World Cup) hosted a &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament featuring 37 teams competing for a $100,000 prize pool.

In 2012, the Electronic Sports League removed the game from the main titles for the 2012–2013 Intel Extreme Masters due to its decreasing popularity outside of Europe.

==Sequels==

Following the success of the first &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, Valve went on to make multiple sequels to the game. &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot;, a game using &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;″s GoldSrc engine, was released in 2004. &quot;Counter-Strike: Source&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, was the first in the series to use Valve&#x27;s Source engine and was also released in 2004, eight months after the release of &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot;. The next game in the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; series to be developed primarily by Valve was &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2012. &quot;Counter-Strike 2&quot;, an updated version of &quot;Global Offensive&quot;, was released in 2023.

The game spawned multiple spin-offs for the Asian gaming market. The first, &quot;Counter-Strike Neo&quot;, was an arcade game developed by Namco and released in Japan in 2003. In 2008, Nexon Corporation released &quot;Counter-Strike Online&quot;, a free-to-play instalment in the series monetized via microtransactions. &quot;Counter-Strike Online&quot; was followed by &quot;Counter-Strike Online 2&quot; in 2013. In 2014, Nexon released &quot;Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies&quot; worldwide via Steam.

<doc id="7434" wikidata="Q134741" url="?curid=7434" title="Camille Pissarro">
<text>Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro ( ; ; 10 July 1830 – 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas (now in the US Virgin Islands, but then in the Danish West Indies). His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.

In 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the &quot;pivotal&quot; figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the &quot;dean of the Impressionist painters&quot;, not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also &quot;by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality&quot;. Paul Cézanne said &quot;he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord&quot;, and he was also one of Paul Gauguin&#x27;s masters. Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to his work as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, through his artistic portrayals of the &quot;common man&quot;, as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without &quot;artifice or grandeur&quot;.

Pissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886. He &quot;acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists&quot; but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, Cézanne, Seurat, Gauguin, and van Gogh.

==Early years==
Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro was born on 10 July 1830 on the island of St. Thomas to Frederick Abraham Gabriel Pissarro and Rachel Manzano-Pomié. His father was of Portuguese Jewish descent and held French nationality. His mother was from a French-Jewish family from St. Thomas with Provençal Jewish roots. His father was a merchant who came to the island from France to deal with the hardware store of a deceased uncle, Isaac Petit, and married his widow. The marriage caused a stir within St. Thomas&#x27;s small Jewish community because she was previously married to Frederick&#x27;s uncle and according to Jewish law a man is forbidden from marrying his aunt. In subsequent years his four children attended the all-black primary school. Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas&#x27; Protestant church.

When Pissarro was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas.

After his schooling, Pissarro returned to St. Thomas at the age of sixteen or seventeen, where his father advocated Pissarro to work in his business as a port clerk. Nevertheless, Pissarro took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practice drawing during breaks and after work.

Visual theorist Nicholas Mirzoeff claims that the young Pissarro was inspired by the artworks of James Gay Sawkins, a British painter and geologist who lived in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas circa 1847. Pissarro may have attended art classes taught by Sawkins and seen Sawkins&#x27;s paintings of Mitla, Mexico. Mirzoeff states, &quot;A formal analysis suggests that [Sawkins&#x27;s] work influenced the young Pissarro, who had just returned to the island from his school in France. Soon afterward, Pissarro began his own drawings of the local African population in apparent imitation of Sawkins,&quot; creating &quot;sketches for a postslavery imagination.&quot;

When Pissarro turned twenty-one, Danish artist Fritz Melbye, then living on St. Thomas, inspired him to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in Venezuela, where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in Caracas and La Guaira. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks.

==Life in France==

In 1855, Pissarro moved back to Paris where he began working as an assistant to Anton Melbye, Fritz Melbye&#x27;s brother and also a painter. He also studied paintings by other artists whose style impressed him: Courbet, Charles-François Daubigny, Jean-François Millet, and Corot. He also enrolled in various classes taught by masters, at schools such as École des Beaux-Arts and Académie Suisse. But Pissarro eventually found their teaching methods &quot;stifling,&quot; states art historian John Rewald. This prompted him to search for alternative instruction, which he requested and received from Corot.

===Paris Salon and Corot&#x27;s influence===

His initial paintings were in accord with the standards at the time to be displayed at the Paris Salon, the official body whose academic traditions dictated the kind of art that was acceptable. The Salon&#x27;s annual exhibition was essentially the only marketplace for young artists to gain exposure. As a result, Pissarro worked in the traditional and prescribed manner to satisfy the tastes of its official committee.

In 1859 his first painting was accepted and exhibited. His other paintings during that period were influenced by Camille Corot, who tutored him. He and Corot shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature. It was by Corot that Pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors, also called &quot;plein air&quot; painting. Pissarro found Corot, along with the work of Gustave Courbet, to be &quot;statements of pictorial truth,&quot; writes Rewald. He discussed their work often. Jean-François Millet was another whose work he admired, especially his &quot;sentimental renditions of rural life&quot;.

===Use of natural outdoor settings===
During this period Pissarro began to understand and appreciate the importance of expressing on canvas the beauties of nature without adulteration. After a year in Paris, he therefore began to leave the city and paint scenes in the countryside to capture the daily reality of village life. He found the French countryside to be &quot;picturesque,&quot; and worthy of being painted. It was still mostly agricultural and sometimes called the &quot;golden age of the peasantry&quot;. Pissarro later explained the technique of painting outdoors to a student:

:&quot;Work at the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it. Paint generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the first impression.&quot;

Corot would complete his paintings back in his studio, often revising them according to his preconceptions. Pissarro, however, preferred to finish his paintings outdoors, often at one sitting, which gave his work a more realistic feel. As a result, his art was sometimes criticised as being &quot;vulgar,&quot; because he painted what he saw: &quot;rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes, mounds of earth, and trees in various stages of development.&quot; According to one source, such details were equivalent to today&#x27;s art showing garbage cans or beer bottles on the side of a street. This difference in style created disagreements between Pissarro and Corot.

===With Monet, Cézanne, and Guillaumin===

In 1859, while attending the free school, the Académie Suisse, Pissarro became friends with a number of younger artists who likewise chose to paint in the more realistic style. Among them were Claude Monet, Armand Guillaumin and Paul Cézanne. What they shared in common was their dissatisfaction with the dictates of the Salon. Cézanne&#x27;s work had been mocked at the time by the others in the school, and, writes Rewald, in his later years Cézanne &quot;never forgot the sympathy and understanding with which Pissarro encouraged him.&quot; As a part of the group, Pissarro was comforted from knowing he was not alone, and that others similarly struggled with their art.

Pissarro agreed with the group about the importance of portraying individuals in natural settings, and expressed his dislike of any artifice or grandeur in his works, despite what the Salon demanded for its exhibits. In 1863 almost all of the group&#x27;s paintings were rejected by the Salon, and French Emperor Napoleon III instead decided to place their paintings in a separate exhibit hall, the Salon des Refusés. However, only works of Pissarro and Cézanne were included, and the separate exhibit brought a hostile response from both the officials of the Salon and the public.

In subsequent Salon exhibits of 1865 and 1866, Pissarro acknowledged his influences from Melbye and Corot, whom he listed as his masters in the catalogue. But in the exhibition of 1868 he no longer credited other artists as an influence, in effect declaring his independence as a painter. This was noted at the time by art critic and author Émile Zola, who offered his opinion:

:&quot;Camille Pissarro is one of the three or four true painters of this day ... I have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure.&quot;

Another writer tries to describe elements of Pissarro&#x27;s style:
:&quot;The brightness of his palette envelops objects in atmosphere ... He paints the smell of the earth.&quot;
And though, on orders from the hanging Committee and the Marquis de Chennevières, Pissarro&#x27;s paintings of Pontoise for example had been skyed, hung near the ceiling, this did not prevent Jules-Antoine Castagnary from noting that the qualities of his paintings had been observed by art lovers. At the age of thirty-eight, Pissarro had begun to win himself a reputation as a landscapist to rival Corot and Daubigny.

In the late 1860s or early 1870s, Pissarro became fascinated with Japanese prints, which influenced his desire to experiment in new compositions. He described the art to his son Lucien:

:&quot;It is marvelous. This is what I see in the art of this astonishing people ... nothing that leaps to the eye, a calm, a grandeur, an extraordinary unity, a rather subdued radiance ...&quot;

===Marriage and children===
In 1871 in Croydon, England, he married his mother&#x27;s maid, Julie Vellay, a vineyard grower&#x27;s daughter, with whom he had seven children, six of whom would become painters: Lucien Pissarro (1863–1944), Georges Henri Manzana Pissarro (1871–1961), Félix Pissarro (1874–1897), (1878–1952), (1881–1948), and Paul-Émile Pissarro (1884–1972). They lived outside Paris in Pontoise and later in Louveciennes, both of which places inspired many of his paintings including scenes of village life, along with rivers, woods, and people at work. He also kept in touch with the other artists of his earlier group, especially Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, and Frédéric Bazille.

=== Political thought ===
Pissarro was involved in anarchist circles and held strong views of egalitarianism. Pissarro was a subscriber to the radical anarchist publication Le Révolté and was in consistent communication with leading anarchist theorizer Jean Grave as well as fellow anarchist artists such as Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. His political philosophies also motivated some of his art. For instance, in 1889, Pissarro created an album of 30 drawings titled Turpitudes Sociales, using a style of caricature and allegory to critique modern societal issues. The purpose of the album was political, Pissarro created the album as a gift for his niece aiming to solidify her anarchist tendencies.

==The London years==

After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, having only Danish nationality and being unable to join the army, he moved his family to Norwood, then a village on the edge of London. However, his style of painting, which was a forerunner of what was later called &quot;Impressionism&quot;, did not do well. He wrote to his friend, Théodore Duret, that &quot;my painting doesn&#x27;t catch on, not at all ...&quot;

Pissarro met the Paris art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, in London, who became the dealer who helped sell his art for most of his life. Durand-Ruel put him in touch with Monet who was likewise in London during this period. They both viewed the work of British landscape artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner, which confirmed their belief that their style of open air painting gave the truest depiction of light and atmosphere, an effect that they felt could not be achieved in the studio alone. Pissarro&#x27;s paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look, with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of impasto, giving more depth to the work.

===Paintings===
Through the paintings Pissarro completed at this time, he records Sydenham and the Norwoods at a time when they were just recently connected by railways, but prior to the expansion of suburbia. One of the largest of these paintings is a view of &quot;St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church&quot; at Lawrie Park Avenue, commonly known as &quot;The Avenue, Sydenham&quot;, in the collection of the National Gallery in London. Twelve oil paintings date from his stay in Upper Norwood and are listed and illustrated in the catalogue raisonné prepared jointly by his fifth child Ludovic-Rodolphe Pissarro and Lionello Venturi and published in 1939. These paintings include &quot;Lower Norwood Under Snow&quot;, and &quot;Lordship Lane Station&quot;, views of The Crystal Palace relocated from Hyde Park, &quot;Dulwich College&quot;, &quot;Sydenham Hill&quot;, &quot;All Saints Church Upper Norwood&quot;, and a lost painting of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church.

Returning to France, Pissarro lived in Pontoise from 1872 to 1884. In 1890 he again visited England and painted some ten scenes of central London. He came back again in 1892, painting in Kew Gardens and Kew Green, and also in 1897, when he produced several oils described as being of Bedford Park, Chiswick, but in fact all being of the nearby Stamford Brook area except for one of Bath Road, which runs from Stamford Brook along the south edge of Bedford Park.

==French Impressionism==

When Pissarro returned to his home in France after the war, he discovered that of the 1,500 paintings he had done over 20 years, which he was forced to leave behind when he moved to London, only 40 remained. The rest had been damaged or destroyed by the soldiers, who often used them as floor mats outside in the mud to keep their boots clean. It is assumed that many of those lost were done in the Impressionist style he was then developing, thereby &quot;documenting the birth of Impressionism.&quot; Armand Silvestre, a critic, went so far as to call Pissarro &quot;basically the inventor of this [Impressionist] painting&quot;; however, Pissarro&#x27;s role in the Impressionist movement was &quot;less that of the great man of ideas than that of the good counselor and appeaser ...&quot; &quot;Monet ... could be seen as the guiding force.&quot;

He soon reestablished his friendships with the other Impressionist artists of his earlier group, including Cézanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir, and Degas. Pissarro now expressed his opinion to the group that he wanted an alternative to the Salon so their group could display their own unique styles.

To assist in that endeavour, in 1873 he helped establish a separate collective, called the &quot;Société Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs,&quot; which included fifteen artists. Pissarro created the group&#x27;s first charter and became the &quot;pivotal&quot; figure in establishing and holding the group together. One writer noted that with his prematurely grey beard, the forty-three-year-old Pissarro was regarded as a &quot;wise elder and father figure&quot; by the group. Yet he was able to work alongside the other artists on equal terms due to his youthful temperament and creativity. Another writer said of him that &quot;he has unchanging spiritual youth and the look of an ancestor who remained a young man&quot;.

===Impressionist exhibitions that shocked the critics===

The following year, in 1874, the group held their First Impressionist Exhibition, which shocked and &quot;horrified&quot; the critics, who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious, historical, or mythological settings. They found fault with the Impressionist paintings on many grounds:
*The subject matter was considered &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;commonplace,&quot; with scenes of street people going about their everyday lives. Pissarro&#x27;s paintings, for instance, showed scenes of muddy, dirty, and unkempt settings;
*The manner of painting was too sketchy and looked incomplete, especially compared to the traditional styles of the period. The use of visible and expressive brushwork by all the artists was considered an insult to the craft of traditional artists, who often spent weeks on their work. Here, the paintings were often done in one sitting and the paints were applied wet-on-wet;
*The use of color by the Impressionists relied on new theories they developed, such as having shadows painted with the reflected light of surrounding, and often unseen, objects.

===A &quot;revolutionary&quot; style===
Pissarro showed five of his paintings, all landscapes, at the exhibit, and again Émile Zola praised his art and that of the others. In the Impressionist exhibit of 1876, however, art critic Albert Wolff complained in his review, &quot;Try to make M. Pissarro understand that trees are not violet, that sky is not the color of fresh butter ...&quot; Journalist and art critic Octave Mirbeau on the other hand, writes, &quot;Camille Pissarro has been a revolutionary through the revitalized working methods with which he has endowed painting&quot;.
According to Rewald, Pissarro had taken on an attitude more simple and natural than the other artists. He writes:

:&quot;Rather than glorifying—consciously or not—the rugged existence of the peasants, he placed them without any &#x27;pose&#x27; in their habitual surroundings, thus becoming an objective chronicler of one of the many facets of contemporary life.&quot;

In later years, Cézanne also recalled this period and referred to Pissarro as &quot;the first Impressionist&quot;. In 1906, a few years after Pissarro&#x27;s death, Cézanne, then 67 and a role model for the new generation of artists, paid Pissarro a debt of gratitude by having himself listed in an exhibition catalogue as &quot;Paul Cézanne, pupil of Pissarro&quot;.

Pissarro, Degas, and American impressionist Mary Cassatt planned a journal of their original prints in the late 1870s, a project that nevertheless came to nothing when Degas withdrew. Art historian and the artist&#x27;s great-grandson Joachim Pissarro notes that they &quot;professed a passionate disdain for the Salons and refused to exhibit at them.&quot; Together they shared an &quot;almost militant resolution&quot; against the Salon, and through their later correspondences it is clear that their mutual admiration &quot;was based on a kinship of ethical as well as aesthetic concerns&quot;.

Cassatt had befriended Degas and Pissarro years earlier when she joined Pissarro&#x27;s newly formed French Impressionist group and gave up opportunities to exhibit in the United States. She and Pissarro were often treated as &quot;two outsiders&quot; by the Salon since neither were French or had become French citizens. However, she was &quot;fired up with the cause&quot; of promoting Impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting &quot;out of solidarity with her new friends&quot;. Towards the end of the 1890s she began to distance herself from the Impressionists, avoiding Degas at times as she did not have the strength to defend herself against his &quot;wicked tongue&quot;. Instead, she came to prefer the company of &quot;the gentle Camille Pissarro&quot;, with whom she could speak frankly about the changing attitudes toward art. She once described him as a teacher &quot;that could have taught the stones to draw correctly.&quot;

=== Other mediums ===
Pissarro was also known to experiment with lithographs, woodblock engravings, and original techniques in multicolor etching and monotype. Art historian Cora Michael notes that “of the Impressionists, Pissarro was perhaps the one most devoted to printmaking and…approached prints from the point of view of an avant-garde artist.” In the 1880s to early 1890s, Pissarro returned to his studio in Pontoise, where he worked with many different print mediums to produce works such as “Vegetable Market at Pontoise” and “The Road to Rouen: The Hills of Pontoise&quot;.

==Neo-Impressionist period==
By the 1880s, Pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting to break out of what he felt was an artistic &quot;mire&quot;. As a result, Pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people, which he had done in Venezuela in his youth. Degas described Pissarro&#x27;s subjects as &quot;peasants working to make a living&quot;.

However, this period also marked the end of the Impressionist period due to Pissarro&#x27;s leaving the movement. As Joachim Pissarro points out:

&quot;Once such a die-hard Impressionist as Pissarro had turned his back on Impressionism, it was apparent that Impressionism had no chance of surviving ...&quot;

It was Pissarro&#x27;s intention during this period to help &quot;educate the public&quot; by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings, without idealising their lives. Pierre-Auguste Renoir, in 1882, referred to Pissarro&#x27;s work during this period as &quot;revolutionary,&quot; in his attempt to portray the &quot;common man.&quot; Pissarro himself did not use his art to overtly preach any kind of political message, however, although his preference for painting humble subjects was intended to be seen and purchased by his upper class clientele. He also began painting with a more unified brushwork along with pure strokes of color.

===Studying with Seurat and Signac===

In 1885 he met Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, both of whom relied on a more &quot;scientific&quot; theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colours to create the illusion of blended colours and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as pointillism. The paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son Lucien.

All four works were considered an &quot;exception&quot; to the eighth exhibition. Joachim Pissarro notes that virtually every reviewer who commented on Pissarro&#x27;s work noted &quot;his extraordinary capacity to change his art, revise his position and take on new challenges.&quot; One critic writes:

:&quot;It is difficult to speak of Camille Pissarro ... What we have here is a fighter from way back, a master who continually grows and courageously adapts to new theories.&quot;

Pissarro explained the new art form as a &quot;phase in the logical march of Impressionism&quot;, but he was alone among the other Impressionists with this attitude, however. Joachim Pissarro states that Pissarro thereby became the &quot;only artist who went from Impressionism to Neo-Impressionism&quot;.

In 1884, art dealer Theo van Gogh asked Pissarro if he would take in his older brother, Vincent, as a boarder in his home. Lucien Pissarro wrote that his father was impressed by Van Gogh&#x27;s work and had &quot;foreseen the power of this artist&quot;, who was 23 years younger. Although Van Gogh never boarded with him, Pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color, ideas which he later used in his paintings, notes Lucien.

===Abandoning Neo-Impressionism===

Pissarro eventually turned away from Neo-Impressionism, claiming its system was too artificial. He explains in a letter to a friend:

:&quot;Having tried this theory for four years and having then abandoned it ... I can no longer consider myself one of the neo-impressionists ... It was impossible to be true to my sensations and consequently to render life and movement, impossible to be faithful to the effects, so random and so admirable, of nature, impossible to give an individual character to my drawing, [that] I had to give up.&quot;

However, after reverting to his earlier style, his work became, according to Rewald, &quot;more subtle, his color scheme more refined, his drawing firmer ... So it was that Pissarro approached old age with an increased mastery.&quot;

But the change also added to Pissarro&#x27;s continual financial hardship which he felt until his 60s. His &quot;headstrong courage and a tenacity to undertake and sustain the career of an artist&quot;, writes Joachim Pissarro, was due to his &quot;lack of fear of the immediate repercussions&quot; of his stylistic decisions. In addition, his work was strong enough to &quot;bolster his morale and keep him going&quot;, he writes. His Impressionist contemporaries, however, continued to view his independence as a &quot;mark of integrity&quot;, and they turned to him for advice, referring to him as &quot;Père Pissarro&quot; (father Pissarro).

==Later years==
In his older age Pissarro suffered from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As a result of this disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.

Pissarro died in Paris on 13 November 1903 and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Legacy and influence==

During the period Pissarro exhibited his works, art critic Armand Silvestre had called Pissarro the &quot;most real and most naive member&quot; of the Impressionist group. His work has also been described by art historian Diane Kelder as expressing &quot;the same quiet dignity, sincerity, and durability that distinguished his person.&quot; She adds that &quot;no member of the group did more to mediate the internecine disputes that threatened at times to break it apart, and no one was a more diligent proselytizer of the new painting.&quot;

According to Pissarro&#x27;s son, Lucien, his father painted regularly with Cézanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked a few miles to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro&#x27;s eyes, as he admired Pissarro&#x27;s landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that &quot;he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord.&quot;

Lucien Pissarro was taught painting by his father, and described him as a &quot;splendid teacher, never imposing his personality on his pupil.&quot; Gauguin, who also studied under him, referred to Pissarro &quot;as a force with which future artists would have to reckon&quot;. Art historian Diane Kelder notes that it was Pissarro who introduced Gauguin, who was then a young stockbroker studying to become an artist, to Degas and Cézanne. Gauguin, near the end of his career, wrote a letter to a friend in 1902, shortly before Pissarro&#x27;s death:

:&quot;If we observe the totality of Pissarro&#x27;s work, we find there, despite fluctuations, not only an extreme artistic will, never belied, but also an essentially intuitive, purebred art ... He was one of my masters and I do not deny him.&quot;

The American impressionist Mary Cassatt, who at one point lived in Paris to study art, and joined his Impressionist group, noted that he was &quot;such a teacher that he could have taught the stones to draw correctly.&quot;

Caribbean author and scholar Derek Walcott based his book-length poem, &quot;Tiepolo&#x27;s Hound&quot; (2000), on Pissarro&#x27;s life.

Camille Pissarro is a pivotal character in the historical fiction novels, The Dream Collector, Books I &amp; II by R.w. Meek, depicting his major role among the Impressionists and his open-mindedness toward the Post-Impressionist art of George Seurat, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.

===The legacy of Nazi-looted Pissarros===

During the early 1930s throughout Europe, Jewish owners of numerous fine art masterpieces found themselves forced to give up or sell off their collections for minimal prices due to anti-Jewish laws created by the new Nazi regime. Many Jews were forced to flee Germany starting in 1933, and then, as the Nazis expanded their hold over all of Europe, Austria, France, Holland, Poland, Italy and other countries. The Nazis created special looting organizations like the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce whose mission it was to seize Jewish property notably valuable artworks. When those forced into exile or deported to extermination camps owned valuables, including artwork, they were often sold to finance the Nazi war effort, sent to Hitler&#x27;s personal museum, traded or seized by officials for personal gain. Several artworks by Pissarro were looted from their Jewish owners in Germany, France and elsewhere by the Nazis.

Pissarro&#x27;s &quot;Shepherdess Bringing Home the Sheep&quot; (La Bergère Rentrant des Moutons&quot;) was looted from the Jewish art collectors Yvonne et Raoul Meyer in France in 1941 and transited via Switzerland and New York before entering the Fred Jones Jr Museum at the University of Oklahoma. In 2014, Meyer&#x27;s daughter, Léonie-Noëlle Meyer filed a restitution claim which resulted in years of court battle. The lawsuit resulted in the recognition of Meyer&#x27;s ownership and its transfer to France for five years, coupled with an agreement to shuttle the painting back and forth between Paris and Oklahoma every three years after that. However, in 2020 Meyer filed suit in a French court to challenge the accord. After Fred Jones Jr Museum sued Meyer requesting heavy financial penalties, the Holocaust survivor abandoned her effort to recover the Pissarro, saying, &quot;I have no other choice.

Pissarro&#x27;s Picking Peas (La Cueillette) was looted from Jewish businessman Simon Bauer, in addition to 92 other artworks seized in 1943 by the Vichy collaborationist regime in France.

Pissarro&#x27;s &quot;Sower And Ploughman&quot;, was owned by Dr Henri Hinrichsen, a Jewish music publisher from Leipzig, until 11 January 1940, when he was forced to relinquish the painting to Hildebrand Gurlitt in Nazi-occupied Brussels, before being murdered in Auschwitz in September 1942.

Pissarro&#x27;s &quot;Le Quai Malaquais, Printemps&quot;, owned by German Jewish publisher Samuel Fischer, founder of the famous S. Fischer Verlag, passed through the hands of infamous Nazi art looter Bruno Lohse.

Pissarro&#x27;s &quot;Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matinée de Printemps&quot;, owned by Max Silberberg, a German Jewish industrialist whose renowned art collection was considered &quot;one of the best in pre-war Germany&quot;, was seized and sold in a forced auction before Silberberg and his wife Johanna were murdered in Auschwitz.

In the decades after World War II, many art masterpieces were found on display in various galleries and museums in Europe and the United States, often with false provenances and labels missing. Some, as a result of legal action, were later returned to the families of the original owners. Many of the recovered paintings were then donated to the same or other museums as a gift.

One such lost piece, Pissarro&#x27;s 1897 oil painting, &quot;Rue St. Honoré, Apres Midi, Effet de Pluie&quot;, was discovered hanging at Madrid&#x27;s government-owned museum, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza. In January 2011 the Spanish government denied a request by the US ambassador to return the painting. At the subsequent trial in Los Angeles, the court ruled that the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Foundation was the rightful owner. In 1999, Pissarro&#x27;s 1897 &quot;Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matinée de Printemps&quot; appeared in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, its donor having been unaware of its pre-war provenance. In January 2012, &quot;Le Marché aux Poissons&quot; (The Fish Market), a color monotype, was returned after 30 years.

During his lifetime, Camille Pissarro sold few of his paintings. By the 21st century, however, his paintings were selling for millions. An auction record for the artist was set on 6 November 2007 at Christie&#x27;s in New York, where a group of four paintings, &quot;Les Quatre Saisons&quot; (the Four Seasons), sold for $14,601,000 (estimate $12,000,000 – $18,000,000). In November 2009 &quot;Le Pont Boieldieu et la Gare d&#x27;Orléans, Rouen, Soleil&quot; sold for $7,026,500 at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York.

In February 2014 the 1897 &quot;Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matinée de Printemps&quot;, originally owned by the German industrialist and Holocaust victim Max Silberberg (de), sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London for £19.9M, nearly five times the previous record.

In October 2021 Berlin&#x27;s Alte Nationalgalerie restituted Pissarro&#x27;s &quot;A Square in La Roche-Guyon&quot; (1867) to the heirs of Armand Dorville, a French Jewish art collector whose family was persecuted by the Nazis and whose paintings had been sold at a 1942 auction in Nice that was overseen by the Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives. The museum then purchased the Pissarro back.
==A family of painters==

Camille&#x27;s son Lucien was an Impressionist and Neo-impressionist painter as were his second and third sons Georges Henri Manzana Pissarro and Félix Pissarro. Lucien&#x27;s daughter Orovida Pissarro was also a painter. Camille&#x27;s great-grandson, Joachim Pissarro, became Head Curator of Drawing and Painting at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and a professor in Hunter College&#x27;s Art Department. Camille&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Lélia Pissarro, has had her work exhibited alongside her great-grandfather. Another great-granddaughter, Julia Pissarro, a Barnard College graduate, is also active in the art scene. From the only daughter of Camille, Jeanne Pissarro, other painters include Henri Bonin-Pissarro (1918–2003) and Claude Bonin-Pissarro (born 1921), who is the father of the Abstract artist Frédéric Bonin-Pissarro (born 1964).

The grandson of Camille Pissarro, Hugues Claude Pissarro (dit Pomié), was born in 1935 in the western section of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and began to draw and paint as a young child under his father&#x27;s tutelage. During his adolescence and early twenties he studied the works of the great masters at the Louvre. His work has been featured in exhibitions in Europe and the United States, and he was commissioned by the White House in 1959 to paint a portrait of U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. He now lives and paints in Donegal, Ireland, with his wife Corinne also an accomplished artist and their children.

<text>The diagnostic tests in cardiology are methods of identifying heart conditions associated with healthy vs. unhealthy, pathologic heart function.

==Bedside==

===History===
Obtaining a medical history is always the first &quot;test&quot;, part of understanding the likelihood of significant disease, as detectable within the current limitations of clinical medicine. Yet heart problems often produce no symptoms until very advanced, and many symptoms, such as palpitations and sensations of extra or missing heart beats correlate poorly with relative heart health &quot;vs&quot; disease. Hence, a history alone is rarely sufficient to diagnose a heart condition.

===Auscultation===
&quot;Auscultation&quot; employs a stethoscope to more easily hear various normal and abnormal sounds, such as normal heart beat sounds and the usual heart beat sound changes associated with breathing versus heart murmurs.

==Laboratory==

===Blood tests===
A variety of &quot;blood tests&quot; are available for analyzing cholesterol transport behavior, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, lipoprotein little a, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, blood sugar control: fasting, after eating or averages using glycated albumen or hemoglobin, myoglobin, creatine kinase, troponin, brain-type natriuretic peptide, etc. to assess the evolution of coronary artery disease and evidence of existing damage. A great many more physiologic markers related to atherosclerosis and heart function are used and being developed and evaluated in research.
(*) due to the high cost, LDL is usually calculated instead of being measured directly&lt;br&gt;

==Electrophysiology==

===Electrocardiogram===
&quot;Electrocardiography&quot; (ECG/EKG in German vernacular. Elektrokardiogram) monitors electrical activity of the heart, primarily as recorded from the skin surface. A 12 lead recording, recording the electrical activity in three planes, anterior, posterior, and lateral is the most commonly used form. The ECG allows observation of the heart electrical activity by visualizing waveform beat origin (typically from the sinoatrial or SA node) following down the bundle of HIS and ultimately stimulating the ventricles to contract forcing blood through the body. Much can be learned by observing the QRS morphology (named for the respective portions of the polarization/repolarization waveform of the wave, P,Q,R,S,T wave). Rhythm abnormalities can also be visualized as in slow heart rate bradycardia, or fast heart rate tachycardia.

===Fasegram===
A &quot;Fasegraphy&quot; allows expanding the system of Electrocardiography diagnostic features, based on the evaluation of the speed characteristics of the process, and thereby increasing the sensitivity and specificity of ECG-diagnostics.

Fasegraphy allows determining the initial features of changes in the cardiac muscle, even on a single-channel ECG, which are underestimated in traditional ECG diagnostics.

===Holter monitor===
A &quot;Holter monitor&quot; records a continuous EKG rhythm pattern (rarely a full EKG) for 24 hours or more. These monitors are used for suspected frequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer may not recognize by symptoms. They are more expensive than event monitors.

===Event monitor===
An &quot;event monitor&quot; records short term EKG rhythm patterns, generally storing the last 2 to 5 minutes, adding in new and discarding old data, for 1 to 2 weeks or more. There are several different types with different capabilities. When the wearer presses a button on the monitor, it quits discarding old and continues recording for a short additional period. The wearer then plays the recording, via a standard phone connection, to a center with compatible receiving and rhythm printing equipment, after which the monitor is ready to record again. These monitors are used for suspected infrequent rhythm abnormalities, especially ones the wearer does recognize by symptoms. They are less expensive than Holter monitors.

===Cardiac stress testing===
&quot;Cardiac stress testing&quot; is used to determine to assess cardiac function and to disclose evidence of exertion-related cardiac hypoxia. Radionuclide testing using thallium or technetium can be used to demonstrate areas of perfusion abnormalities. With a maximal stress test the level of exercise is increased until the person&#x27;s heart rate will not increase any higher, despite increased exercise. A fairly accurate estimate of the target heart rate, based on extensive clinical research, can be estimated by the formula 220 beats per minute minus patient&#x27;s age. This linear relation is accurate up to about age 30, after which it mildly underestimates typical maximum attainable heart rates achievable by healthy individuals. Other formulas exist, such as that by Miller (217 - (0.85 × Age)) and others. Achieving a high enough heart rate at the end of exercise is critical to improving the sensitivity of the test to detect high grade heart artery stenosis. High frequency analysis of the QRS complex may be useful for detection of coronary artery disease during an exercise stress test.

===Electrophysiology study===
The electrophysiology study or EP study is the end all of electrophysiological tests of the heart. It involves a catheter with electrodes probing the endocardium, the inside of the heart, and testing the conduction pathways and electrical activity of individual areas of the heart.

==Medical imaging==

Cardiac imaging techniques include coronary catheterization, echocardiogram, intravascular ultrasound, retinal vessel analysis and the coronary calcium scan.

<doc id="7437" wikidata="Q199588" url="?curid=7437" title="Carlo Collodi">
<text>Carlo Lorenzini (; 24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), better known by the pen name Carlo Collodi ( ; ), was an Italian author, humourist, and journalist, widely known for his fairy tale novel &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;.

==Early life==
Collodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826. His mother Angiolina Orzali Lorenzini was a seamstress from Collodi, the town from which he later took the pen name, and his father Domenico Lorenzini was a cook. Both parents worked for the &#x27; Ginori Lisci. Carlo was the eldest child in the family and he had ten siblings; seven died at a young age. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. He lived there with his maternal grandmother. After attending primary school, he was sent to study at a theological seminary in Colle Val d&#x27;Elsa. An account at the seminary shows that the &#x27; had offered financial aid, but the boy found that he did not want to be a priest so he continued his education at the College of the Scolopi Fathers in Florence. In 1844, he started working at the Florentine bookstore Libreria Piatti, where he assisted Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist.

==Career==
During the Italian Wars of Independence in 1848 and 1860, Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan Army. His active interest in political matters can be seen in his earliest literary works, as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854, he published his second newspaper, &#x27; (&quot;The Controversy&quot;). Lorenzini&#x27;s first publications were in his periodicals. A debut came in 1856 with the play &#x27; and parodic guidebook , both in 1856. By 1860, he published his first notable work called &quot;&quot; (Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother&#x27;s hometown.

Collodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as &#x27;; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including &#x27; (1880), &#x27; (1881), and &#x27; (1887).

Collodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterwards, so he turned to children&#x27;s literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian. In 1875, for instance, he completed &#x27;, a translation of French fairy tales by Charles Perrault. In 1876, Collodi wrote &#x27; (inspired by Alessandro Luigi Parravicini&#x27;s &quot;Giannetto&quot;), the &#x27;, and &#x27;, a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character Giannettino.

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through allegory. In 1880, he began writing &#x27; (&quot;Story of a Marionette&quot;), also called &quot;Le avventure di Pinocchio&quot;, which was published weekly in &#x27;. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was adapted into a 1940 film by Disney that is considered to be one of Disney&#x27;s greatest films.

Collodi died suddenly in Florence on 26 October 1890 at the age of 63 and is interred at Cimitero Monumentale Delle Porte Sante in Florence. The National Carlo Collodi Foundation was established in 1962 to promote education and the works of Collodi, and Pinocchio Park, which was opened in 1956 in the town of Collodi and remains a popular attraction today.

<doc id="7439" wikidata="Q1321926" url="?curid=7439" title="Constructible number">
<text>In geometry and algebra, a real number formula_1 is constructible if and only if, given a line segment of unit length, a line segment of length formula_2 can be constructed with compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps. Equivalently, formula_1 is constructible if and only if there is a closed-form expression for formula_1 using only integers and the operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.

The geometric definition of constructible numbers motivates a corresponding definition of constructible points, which can again be described either geometrically or algebraically. A point is constructible if it can be produced as one of the points of a compass and straightedge construction (an endpoint of a line segment or crossing point of two lines or circles), starting from a given unit length segment. Alternatively and equivalently, taking the two endpoints of the given segment to be the points (0, 0) and (1, 0) of a Cartesian coordinate system, a point is constructible if and only if its Cartesian coordinates are both constructible numbers. Constructible numbers and points have also been called ruler and compass numbers and ruler and compass points, to distinguish them from numbers and points that may be constructed using other processes.

The set of constructible numbers forms a field: applying any of the four basic arithmetic operations to members of this set produces another constructible number. This field is a field extension of the rational numbers and in turn is contained in the field of algebraic numbers. It is the Euclidean closure of the rational numbers, the smallest field extension of the rationals that includes the square roots of all of its positive numbers.

The proof of the equivalence between the algebraic and geometric definitions of constructible numbers has the effect of transforming geometric questions about compass and straightedge constructions into algebra, including several famous problems from ancient Greek mathematics. The algebraic formulation of these questions led to proofs that their solutions are not constructible, after the geometric formulation of the same problems previously defied centuries of attack.

== Geometric definitions ==
===Geometrically constructible points===
Let formula_5 and formula_6 be two given distinct points in the Euclidean plane, and define formula_7 to be the set of points that can be constructed with compass and straightedge starting with formula_5 and formula_6. Then the points of formula_7 are called constructible points. formula_5 and formula_6 are, by definition, elements of formula_7. To more precisely describe the remaining elements of formula_7, make the following two definitions:
* a line segment whose endpoints are in formula_7 is called a constructed segment, and
* a circle whose center is in formula_7 and which passes through a point of formula_7 (alternatively, whose radius is the distance between some pair of distinct points of formula_7) is called a constructed circle.
Then, the points of formula_7, besides formula_5 and formula_6 are:
* the intersection of two non-parallel constructed segments, or lines through constructed segments,
* the intersection points of a constructed circle and a constructed segment, or line through a constructed segment, or
* the intersection points of two distinct constructed circles.

As an example, the midpoint of constructed segment formula_22 is a constructible point. One construction for it is to construct two circles with formula_22 as radius, and the line through the two crossing points of these two circles. Then the midpoint of segment formula_22 is the point where this segment is crossed by the constructed line.

===Geometrically constructible numbers===
The starting information for the geometric formulation can be used to define a Cartesian coordinate system in which the point formula_5 is associated to the origin having coordinates formula_26 and in which the point formula_6 is associated with the coordinates formula_28. The points of formula_7 may now be used to link the geometry and algebra by defining a constructible number to be a coordinate of a constructible point.

Equivalent definitions are that a constructible number is the formula_30-coordinate of a constructible point formula_31 or the length of a constructible line segment. In one direction of this equivalence, if a constructible point has coordinates formula_32, then the point formula_31 can be constructed as its perpendicular projection onto the formula_30-axis, and the segment from the origin to this point has length formula_30. In the reverse direction, if formula_30 is the length of a constructible line segment, then intersecting the formula_30-axis with a circle centered at formula_5 with radius formula_30 gives the point formula_31. It follows from this equivalence that every point whose Cartesian coordinates are geometrically constructible numbers is itself a geometrically constructible point. For, when formula_30 and formula_42 are geometrically constructible numbers, point formula_32 can be constructed as the intersection of lines through formula_31 and formula_45, perpendicular to the coordinate axes.

==Algebraic definitions==
===Algebraically constructible numbers===
The algebraically constructible real numbers are the subset of the real numbers that can be described by formulas that combine integers using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, multiplicative inverse, and square roots of positive numbers. Even more simply, at the expense of making these formulas longer, the integers in these formulas can be restricted to be only 0 and 1. For instance, the square root of 2 is constructible, because it can be described by the formulas formula_46 or formula_47.

Analogously, the algebraically constructible complex numbers are the subset of complex numbers that have formulas of the same type, using a more general version of the square root that is not restricted to positive numbers but can instead take arbitrary complex numbers as its argument, and produces the principal square root of its argument. Alternatively, the same system of complex numbers may be defined as the complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are both constructible real numbers. For instance, the complex number formula_48 has the formulas formula_49 or formula_50, and its real and imaginary parts are the constructible numbers 0 and 1 respectively.

These two definitions of the constructible complex numbers are equivalent. In one direction, if formula_51 is a complex number whose real part formula_30 and imaginary part formula_42 are both constructible real numbers, then replacing formula_30 and formula_42 by their formulas within the larger formula formula_56 produces a formula for formula_57 as a complex number. In the other direction, any formula for an algebraically constructible complex number can be transformed into formulas for its real and imaginary parts, by recursively expanding each operation in the formula into operations on the real and imaginary parts of its arguments, using the expansions
*formula_58
*formula_59
*formula_60
*formula_61, where formula_62 and formula_63.

===Algebraically constructible points===
The algebraically constructible points may be defined as the points whose two real Cartesian coordinates are both algebraically constructible real numbers. Alternatively, they may be defined as the points in the complex plane given by algebraically constructible complex numbers. By the equivalence between the two definitions for algebraically constructible complex numbers, these two definitions of algebraically constructible points are also equivalent.

==Equivalence of algebraic and geometric definitions==
If formula_64 and formula_65 are the non-zero lengths of geometrically constructed segments then elementary compass and straightedge constructions can be used to obtain constructed segments of lengths formula_66, formula_67, formula_68, and formula_69. The latter two can be done with a construction based on the intercept theorem. A slightly less elementary construction using these tools is based on the geometric mean theorem and will construct a segment of length formula_70 from a constructed segment of length formula_64. It follows that every algebraically constructible number is geometrically constructible, by using these techniques to translate a formula for the number into a construction for the number.

In the other direction, a set of geometric objects may be specified by algebraically constructible real numbers: coordinates for points, slope and formula_42-intercept for lines, and center and radius for circles. It is possible (but tedious) to develop formulas in terms of these values, using only arithmetic and square roots, for each additional object that might be added in a single step of a compass-and-straightedge construction. It follows from these formulas that every geometrically constructible number is algebraically constructible.

==Algebraic properties==
The definition of algebraically constructible numbers includes the sum, difference, product, and multiplicative inverse of any of these numbers, the same operations that define a field in abstract algebra. Thus, the constructible numbers (defined in any of the above ways) form a field. More specifically, the constructible real numbers form a Euclidean field, an ordered field containing a square root of each of its positive elements. Examining the properties of this field and its subfields leads to necessary conditions on a number to be constructible, that can be used to show that specific numbers arising in classical geometric construction problems are not constructible.

It is convenient to consider, in place of the whole field of constructible numbers, the subfield formula_73 generated by any given constructible number formula_74, and to use the algebraic construction of formula_74 to decompose this field. If formula_74 is a constructible real number, then the values occurring within a formula constructing it can be used to produce a finite sequence of real numbers formula_77 such that, for each formula_48, formula_79 is an extension of formula_80 of degree 2. Using slightly different terminology, a real number is constructible if and only if it lies in a field at the top of a finite tower of real quadratic extensions,
formula_81
starting with the rational field formula_82 where formula_74 is in formula_84 and for all formula_85, formula_86. It follows from this decomposition that the degree of the field extension formula_87 is formula_88, where formula_1 counts the number of quadratic extension steps.

Analogously to the real case, a complex number is constructible if and only if it lies in a field at the top of a finite tower of complex quadratic extensions. More precisely, formula_74 is constructible if and only if there exists a tower of fields
formula_91
where formula_74 is in formula_93, and for all formula_94, formula_95. The difference between this characterization and that of the real constructible numbers is only that the fields in this tower are not restricted to being real. Consequently, if a complex number a complex number formula_74 is constructible, then the above characterization implies that formula_87 is a power of two. However, this condition is not sufficient - there exist field extensions whose degree is a power of two, but which cannot be factored into a sequence of quadratic extensions. 

To obtain a sufficient condition for constructibility, one must instead consider the splitting field formula_98 obtained by adjoining all roots of the minimal polynomial of formula_74. If the degree of extension is a power of two, then its Galois group formula_100 is a 2-group, and thus admits a descending sequence of subgroups
formula_101
with formula_102 for formula_103 By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there is a corresponding tower of quadratic extensions
formula_104
whose topmost field contains formula_105 and from this it follows that formula_74 is constructible.

The fields that can be generated from towers of quadratic extensions of formula_82 are called &quot;&quot; of formula_82. The fields of real and complex constructible numbers are the unions of all real or complex iterated quadratic extensions of formula_82.

==Trigonometric numbers==

Trigonometric numbers are the cosines or sines of angles that are rational multiples of formula_110. These numbers are always algebraic, but they may not be constructible. The cosine or sine of the angle formula_111 is constructible only for certain special numbers formula_112:
*The powers of two
*The Fermat primes, prime numbers that are one plus a power of two
*The products of powers of two and any number of distinct Fermat primes.
Thus, for example, formula_113 is constructible because 15 is the product of the Fermat primes 3 and 5; but formula_114 is not constructible (not being the product of Fermat primes) and neither is formula_115 (being a non-Fermat prime).

== Impossible constructions ==

The ancient Greeks thought that certain problems of straightedge and compass construction they could not solve were simply obstinate, not unsolvable. However, the non-constructibility of certain numbers proves that these constructions are logically impossible to perform. (The problems themselves, however, are solvable using methods that go beyond the constraint of working only with straightedge and compass, and the Greeks knew how to solve them in this way. One such example is Archimedes&#x27; Neusis construction solution of the problem of Angle trisection.)

In particular, the algebraic formulation of constructible numbers leads to a proof of the impossibility of the following construction problems:

;Doubling the cube
:The problem of doubling the unit square is solved by the construction of another square on the diagonal of the first one, with side length formula_46 and area formula_117. Analogously, the problem of doubling the cube asks for the construction of the length formula_118 of the side of a cube with volume formula_117. It is not constructible, because the minimal polynomial of this length, formula_120, has degree 3 over formula_121. As a cubic polynomial whose only real root is irrational, this polynomial must be irreducible, because if it had a quadratic real root then the quadratic conjugate would provide a second real root.
;Angle trisection
:In this problem, from a given angle formula_122, one should construct an angle formula_123. Algebraically, angles can be represented by their trigonometric functions, such as their sines or cosines, which give the Cartesian coordinates of the endpoint of a line segment forming the given angle with the initial segment. Thus, an angle formula_122 is constructible when formula_125 is a constructible number, and the problem of trisecting the angle can be formulated as one of constructing formula_126. For example, the angle formula_127 of an equilateral triangle can be constructed by compass and straightedge, with formula_128. However, its trisection formula_129 cannot be constructed, because formula_130 has minimal polynomial formula_131 of degree 3 over formula_121. Because this specific instance of the trisection problem cannot be solved by compass and straightedge, the general problem also cannot be solved.
;Squaring the circle
:A square with area formula_110, the same area as a unit circle, would have side length formula_134, a transcendental number. Therefore, this square and its side length are not constructible, because it is not algebraic over formula_121.
;Regular polygons
:If a regular formula_112-gon is constructed with its center at the origin, the angles between the segments from the center to consecutive vertices are formula_111. The polygon can be constructed only when the cosine of this angle is a trigonometric number. Thus, for instance, a 15-gon is constructible, but the regular heptagon is not constructible, because 7 is prime but not a Fermat prime. For a more direct proof of its non-constructibility, represent the vertices of a regular heptagon as the complex roots of the polynomial formula_138. Removing the factor formula_139, dividing by formula_140, and substituting formula_141 gives the simpler polynomial formula_142, an irreducible cubic with three real roots, each two times the real part of a complex-number vertex. Its roots are not constructible, so the heptagon is also not constructible.
;Alhazen&#x27;s problem
:If two points and a circular mirror are given, where on the circle does one of the given points see the reflected image of the other? Geometrically, the lines from each given point to the point of reflection meet the circle at equal angles and in equal-length chords. However, it is impossible to construct a point of reflection using a compass and straightedge. In particular, for a unit circle with the two points formula_143 and formula_144 inside it, the solution has coordinates forming roots of an irreducible degree-four polynomial formula_145. Although its degree is a power of two, the splitting field of this polynomial has degree divisible by three, so it does not come from an iterated quadratic extension and Alhazen&#x27;s problem has no compass and straightedge solution.

==History==

The birth of the concept of constructible numbers is inextricably linked with the history of the three impossible compass and straightedge constructions: doubling the cube, trisecting an angle, and squaring the circle. The restriction of using only compass and straightedge in geometric constructions is often credited to Plato due to a passage in Plutarch. According to Plutarch, Plato gave the duplication of the cube (Delian) problem to Eudoxus and Archytas and Menaechmus, who solved the problem using mechanical means, earning a rebuke from Plato for not solving the problem using pure geometry. However, this attribution is challenged, due, in part, to the existence of another version of the story (attributed to Eratosthenes by Eutocius of Ascalon) that says that all three found solutions but they were too abstract to be of practical value. Proclus, citing Eudemus of Rhodes, credited Oenopides ( 450 BCE) with two ruler and compass constructions, leading some authors to hypothesize that Oenopides originated the restriction. The restriction to compass and straightedge is essential to the impossibility of the classic construction problems. Angle trisection, for instance, can be done in many ways, several known to the ancient Greeks. The Quadratrix of Hippias of Elis, the conics of Menaechmus, or the marked straightedge (neusis) construction of Archimedes have all been used, as has a more modern approach via paper folding.
Although not one of the classic three construction problems, the problem of constructing regular polygons with straightedge and compass is often treated alongside them. The Greeks knew how to construct regular with formula_146 (for any integer formula_147), 3, 5, or the product of any two or three of these numbers, but other regular eluded them. In 1796 Carl Friedrich Gauss, then an eighteen-year-old student, announced in a newspaper that he had constructed a regular 17-gon with straightedge and compass. Gauss&#x27;s treatment was algebraic rather than geometric; in fact, he did not actually construct the polygon, but rather showed that the cosine of a central angle was a constructible number. The argument was generalized in his 1801 book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; giving the condition for the construction of a regular Gauss claimed, but did not prove, that the condition was also necessary and several authors, notably Felix Klein, attributed this part of the proof to him as well. Alhazen&#x27;s problem is also not one of the classic three problems, but despite being named after Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), a medieval Islamic mathematician, it already appears in Ptolemy&#x27;s work on optics from the second century.

Pierre Wantzel proved algebraically that the problems of doubling the cube and trisecting the angle are impossible to solve using only compass and straightedge. In the same paper he also solved the problem of determining which regular polygons are constructible:
a regular polygon is constructible if and only if the number of its sides is the product of a power of two and any number of distinct Fermat primes (i.e., the sufficient conditions given by Gauss are also necessary). An attempted proof of the impossibility of squaring the circle was given by James Gregory in &quot;&quot; (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667. Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of . It was not until 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann rigorously proved its impossibility, by extending the work of Charles Hermite and proving that is a transcendental number. Alhazen&#x27;s problem was not proved impossible to solve by compass and straightedge until the work of Jack Elkin.

The study of constructible numbers, per se, was initiated by René Descartes in La Géométrie, an appendix to his book &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; published in 1637. Descartes associated numbers to geometrical line segments in order to display the power of his philosophical method by solving an ancient straightedge and compass construction problem put forth by Pappus.

<text>Carson City, officially the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, is an independent city and the capital of the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,639, making it the 6th most populous city in the state. The majority of the city&#x27;s population lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada, about south of Reno. The city is named after the mountain man Kit Carson (1809-1868). The town began as a stopover for California-bound immigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as Nevada&#x27;s capital since statehood in 1864; for much of its history it was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in 1950.

Before 1969, Carson City was the county seat of Ormsby County. That year, after a referendum approved merging the city and the county, the state legislature issued a revised city charter that merged them into the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With the consolidation, the city limits extend west across the Sierra Nevada to the California-Nevada state line in the middle of Lake Tahoe. Like other independent cities in the United States, it is treated as a county-equivalent for census purposes.

==History==
The Washoe people have inhabited the valley and surrounding areas for about 6,000 years.

The first European Americans to arrive in what is now known as Eagle Valley were John C. Frémont and his exploration party in January 1843. Fremont named the river flowing through the valley Carson River in honor of Kit Carson,(1809-1868), the mountain man, explorer and scout he had hired for his expedition. Later, settlers named the area Washoe, in reference to the indigenous people.

By 1851, the Eagle Station ranch along the Carson River was a trading post and stop-over for westbound travelers and wagons on the California Trail&#x27;s Carson Branch, which ran through Eagle Valley. The valley and trading post received their name from a bald eagle that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured pinned on a wall inside the post.

As the area was part of the larger Utah Territory (1850-1896), it was governed from the territorial (and later state) capital of Salt Lake City on the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake, where the territorial government was headquartered there several hundred miles further east with Mormon (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) patriarch of Brigham Young (1801-1877), as first Governor of Utah. Early settlers bristled at the control by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the provisional Nevada Territory with Isaac Roop (1822-1869, served 1859-1861), as provisional Governor. A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry (1815-1873), sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned future separate territory. In 1858, Abraham Curry bought Eagle Station and the settlement was thereafter renamed Carson City. Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development. Curry decided Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a plot in the center of town for a capitol building.

After gold and silver ore were discovered in 1859 on the nearby newly-named Comstock Lode, Carson City&#x27;s population began to grow. Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of the town center. When new territorial governor James W. Nye (1815-1876, served 1861-1864), traveled east to Nevada, he chose Carson City as the territorial capital instead of earlier Genoa, which had functioned temporarily as such for the past few years. Influenced by Carson City lawyer William M. Stewart (1827-1909), who escorted him from the port of San Francisco, California where he arrived onboard a passenger steamboat liner, then journeying uphill past Sacramento to Nevada. As such, Carson City bested Virginia City and American Flat. Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a temporary meeting hall. The Legislature named Carson City to be the county seat of Ormsby County and also selected the hotel as the territorial prison, with Curry serving as its first warden. Today, the property is still part of the state prison.

When Nevada became the 36th state in 1864 during the American Civil War (1861-1865), Carson City was confirmed as Nevada&#x27;s permanent state capital. Carson City&#x27;s development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center. The Virginia and Truckee Railroad was built between Virginia City and Carson City. A log flume was also built from the Sierra Nevada mountains range into Carson City. The current Nevada State Capitol building was constructed from 1869 to 1871. The United States Mint also operated its branch of the Carson City Mint between the years of 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins of United States currency. People came from China during that time, many to work on the transcontinental railroad being constructed. Some of them owned businesses and taught school. By 1880, almost a thousand Chinese people, &quot;one for every five Caucasians&quot;, lived in Carson City.

Carson City&#x27;s population and transportation traffic decreased when the Central Pacific Railroad built a branch line through Donner Pass to connect with the Carson and Colorado Railroad. The new branch also bypassed the Virginia &amp; Truckee line, and ran too far to the north to benefit Carson City. The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in nearby Tonopah and Goldfield. The United States federal building (now renamed the Paul Laxalt Building) was completed in 1890 as was the Stewart Indian School. Even these developments could not prevent its population from dropping to just over 1,500 people by 1930. Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as &quot;America&#x27;s smallest capital&quot;. The city slowly grew after World War II (1939/1941-1945); by 1960, it had reached its former 1880 mining boom-town era population size of 80 years before.

===20th-century revitalization and growth===
As early as the late 1940s, discussions began about merging Ormsby County and Carson City. By this time, the county was little more than Carson City and a few hamlets to the west. By the 1960 census, all but 2,900 of the county&#x27;s residents lived in Carson City. However, the effort did not pay off until 1966, when a statewide referendum approved the merger. The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968. On April 1, 1969, Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as Empire City, which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current U.S. Route 50. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America&#x27;s largest state capitals with its of city limits.

In 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying no building within of the capitol would surpass it in height. This plan effectively prohibited future high-rise development in the center of downtown. The Ormsby House is the tallest building in downtown Carson City, at a height of . The structure was completed in 1972.

==Geography==
Most of the city proper resides in the Eagle Valley. The Carson River flows from Douglas County through the southwestern edge of both the valley and Carson City. Since the consolidation, the city limits today include several small populated areas outside of this valley. Today the city limits include several peaks in the Sierra Nevada, small portions of both the Virginia Range and the Pine Nut Mountains and portions of Marlette Lake and Lake Tahoe. The highest elevation in city limits is Snow Valley Peak at an elevation of . Carson City is one of two state capitals that border another state, the other being Trenton, New Jersey.

==Government and politics==

Ormsby County consolidated with Carson City in 1969, and the county simultaneously dissolved. The city is now governed by a five-member board of supervisors, consisting of a mayor and four supervisors. All members are elected at-large, but each of the four supervisors must reside in respective wards, numbered 1 through 4. The mayor and supervisors serve four year terms. Elections are staggered so the mayor and the supervisors from Wards 2 and Ward 4 are elected in presidential election years, and the supervisors from Wards 1 and 3 are elected in the even-numbered years in between (i.e., the same year as gubernatorial elections).

The city is generally considered a Republican stronghold, often voting for Republicans by wide margins. In 2004, George W. Bush defeated John Kerry 57–40%. In 2008, however, Barack Obama became the first Democrat since 1964 to win Ormsby County/Carson City, defeating John McCain 49–48%, by 204 votes, a margin of under 1%.











Carson City, being the state capital, has seen many political protests and demonstrations.

In an attempt to either make a proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility at Yucca Mountain prohibitively expensive (by raising property tax rates to the maximum allowed) or to allow the state to collect the potential federal payments of property taxes on the facility, the state government in 1987 carved Yucca Mountain out of Nye County and created a new county with no residents out of the area surrounding Yucca called Bullfrog County. Carson City became the county seat of Bullfrog County, even though it was not in Bullfrog County and is more than from Yucca Mountain. A state judge found the process unconstitutional in 1989, and Bullfrog County&#x27;s territory was retroceded to Nye County.

==Culture==

There are four highways in the city: Nevada State Route 28, U.S. Route 395, U.S. Route 50, and Interstate 580, its only freeway. Phase 1 of the Carson City Freeway Project from US 395, just north of the city, to US 50 was completed in February 2006, and Phase 2A, extending from Rt. 50 to Fairview Drive, was officially opened on September 24, 2009. Phase 2B, Fairview Drive to Rt. 50, was completed in August 2017. Prior to 2012, Carson City was one of only five state capitals not directly served by an interstate highway; the city lost this distinction when I-580 was extended into the city limits.

Carson City&#x27;s first modern bus system, Jump Around Carson, or JAC, opened to the public in October 2005. JAC uses a smaller urban bus ideal for Carson City. Tahoe Transportation District connects Gardnerville with Carson City.

However, there is virtually no ground public transportation to other destinations. Passenger trains have not served Carson City since 1950, when the Virginia and Truckee Railroad was shut down. Greyhound Lines stopped their bus services to the town in 2006 and Amtrak discontinued their connecting thruway bus to Sacramento, California, in 2008. There is now only a limited Monday – Friday RTC bus service, to Reno which is still served by both Greyhound and Amtrak, as well as Eastern Sierra Transit Authority service from Lone Pine to Reno.

Carson City is also served by the Carson Airport, which is a regional airport in the northern part of the city. Reno–Tahoe International Airport, which is away, handles domestic commercial flights.
==Education==
The Carson City School District, the sole public school district of the city, operates ten schools there. The six elementary schools are Bordewich-Bray Elementary School, Empire Elementary School, Fremont Elementary School, Fritsch Elementary School, Mark Twain Elementary School, and Al Seeliger Elementary School. The two middle schools are Carson Middle School and Eagle Valley Middle School. Carson High School and the alternative Pioneer High School serve high school students. Carson High is on Saliman Road.

The district sponsors Carson Montessori School, a public charter school serving grades K-6. Students residing in any Nevada county may enroll. Carson Montessori School is the only school in district operating with a balanced budget. In 2019 Carson Montessori School received the Governor&#x27;s STEM Schools Designation, an official recognition given to 25 schools statewide which causes a short ceremony attended by the governor during which receiving schools are assigned a 10-foot banner.

Western Nevada College (WNC) is a regionally accredited, two-year and four-year institution which is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education. The college offers many programs including education, arts and science.

Carson City has a public library, the Carson City Library.

<doc id="7445" wikidata="Q1340623" url="?curid=7445" title="Classification of finite simple groups">
<text>In mathematics, the classification of finite simple groups (popularly called the enormous theorem) is a result of group theory stating that every finite simple group is either cyclic, or alternating, or belongs to a broad infinite class called the groups of Lie type, or else it is one of twenty-six exceptions, called sporadic (the Tits group is sometimes regarded as a sporadic group because it is not strictly a group of Lie type, in which case there would be 27 sporadic groups). The proof consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004. 

Simple groups can be seen as the basic building blocks of all finite groups, reminiscent of the way the prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the natural numbers. The Jordan–Hölder theorem is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups. However, a significant difference from integer factorization is that such &quot;building blocks&quot; do not necessarily determine a unique group, since there might be many non-isomorphic groups with the same composition series or, put in another way, the extension problem does not have a unique solution.

Daniel Gorenstein (1923-1992), Richard Lyons, and Ronald Solomon are gradually publishing a simplified and revised version of the proof.

==Statement of the classification theorem==

The classification theorem has applications in many branches of mathematics, as questions about the structure of finite groups (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups. Thanks to the classification theorem, such questions can sometimes be answered by checking each family of simple groups and each sporadic group.

Daniel Gorenstein announced in 1983 that the finite simple groups had all been classified, but this was premature as he had been misinformed about the proof of the classification of quasithin groups. The completed proof of the classification was announced by after Aschbacher and Smith published a 1221-page proof for the missing quasithin case.

==Overview of the proof of the classification theorem==
 wrote two volumes outlining the low rank and odd characteristic part of the proof, and 
wrote a 3rd volume covering the remaining characteristic 2 case. The proof can be broken up into several major pieces as follows:

===Groups of small 2-rank===
The simple groups of low 2-rank are mostly groups of Lie type of small rank over fields of odd characteristic, together with five alternating and seven characteristic 2 type and nine sporadic groups.

The simple groups of small 2-rank include:
*Groups of 2-rank 0, in other words groups of odd order, which are all solvable by the Feit–Thompson theorem.
*Groups of 2-rank 1. The Sylow 2-subgroups are either cyclic, which is easy to handle using the transfer map, or generalized quaternion, which are handled with the Brauer–Suzuki theorem: in particular there are no simple groups of 2-rank 1 except for the cyclic group of order two. 
*Groups of 2-rank 2. Alperin showed that the Sylow subgroup must be dihedral, quasidihedral, wreathed, or a Sylow 2-subgroup of &quot;U&quot;3(4). The first case was done by the Gorenstein–Walter theorem which showed that the only simple groups are isomorphic to &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;q&quot;) for &quot;q&quot; odd or &quot;A&quot;7, the second and third cases were done by the Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem which implies that the only simple groups are isomorphic to &quot;L&quot;3(&quot;q&quot;) or &quot;U&quot;3(&quot;q&quot;) for &quot;q&quot; odd or &quot;M&quot;11, and the last case was done by Lyons who showed that &quot;U&quot;3(4) is the only simple possibility.
*Groups of sectional 2-rank at most 4, classified by the Gorenstein–Harada theorem.
The classification of groups of small 2-rank, especially ranks at most 2, makes heavy use of ordinary and modular character theory, which is almost never directly used elsewhere in the classification.

All groups not of small 2 rank can be split into two major classes: groups of component type and groups of characteristic 2 type. This is because if a group has sectional 2-rank at least 5 then MacWilliams showed that its Sylow 2-subgroups are connected, and the balance theorem implies that any simple group with connected Sylow 2-subgroups is either of component type or characteristic 2 type. (For groups of low 2-rank the proof of this breaks down, because theorems such as the signalizer functor theorem only work for groups with elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 3.)

===Groups of component type===
A group is said to be of component type if for some centralizer &quot;C&quot; of an involution, &quot;C&quot;/&quot;O&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) has a component (where &quot;O&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is the core of &quot;C&quot;, the maximal normal subgroup of odd order).
These are more or less the groups of Lie type of odd characteristic of large rank, and alternating groups, together with some sporadic groups.
A major step in this case is to eliminate the obstruction of the core of an involution. This is accomplished by the B-theorem, which states that every component of &quot;C&quot;/&quot;O&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is the image of a component of &quot;C&quot;.

The idea is that these groups have a centralizer of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case and have to be treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.

===Groups of characteristic 2 type===

A group is of characteristic 2 type if the generalized Fitting subgroup &quot;F&quot;*(&quot;Y&quot;) of every 2-local subgroup &quot;Y&quot; is a 2-group.
As the name suggests these are roughly the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2, plus a handful of others that are alternating or sporadic or of odd characteristic. Their classification is divided into the small and large rank cases, where the rank is the largest rank of an odd abelian subgroup normalizing a nontrivial 2-subgroup, which is often (but not always) the same as the rank of a Cartan subalgebra when the group is a group of Lie type in characteristic 2.

The rank 1 groups are the thin groups, classified by Aschbacher, and the rank 2 ones are the notorious quasithin groups, classified by Aschbacher and Smith. These correspond roughly to groups of Lie type of ranks 1 or 2 over fields of characteristic 2.

Groups of rank at least 3 are further subdivided into 3 classes by the trichotomy theorem, proved by Aschbacher for rank 3 and by Gorenstein and Lyons for rank at least 4.
The three classes are groups of GF(2) type (classified mainly by Timmesfeld), groups of &quot;standard type&quot; for some odd prime (classified by the Gilman–Griess theorem and work by several others), and groups of uniqueness type, where a result of Aschbacher implies that there are no simple groups.
The general higher rank case consists mostly of the groups of Lie type over fields of characteristic 2 of rank at least 3 or 4.

===Existence and uniqueness of the simple groups===

The main part of the classification produces a characterization of each simple group. It is then necessary to check that there exists a simple group for each characterization and that it is unique. This gives a large number of separate problems; for example, the original proofs of existence and uniqueness of the monster group totaled about 200 pages, and the identification of the Ree groups by Thompson and Bombieri was one of the hardest parts of the classification. Many of the existence proofs and some of the uniqueness proofs for the sporadic groups originally used computer calculations, most of which have since been replaced by shorter hand proofs.

==History of the proof==

===Gorenstein&#x27;s program===
In 1972 announced a program for completing the classification of finite simple groups, consisting of the following 16 steps:
# Groups of low 2-rank. This was essentially done by Gorenstein and Harada, who classified the groups with sectional 2-rank at most 4. Most of the cases of 2-rank at most 2 had been done by the time Gorenstein announced his program.
# The semisimplicity of 2-layers. The problem is to prove that the 2-layer of the centralizer of an involution in a simple group is semisimple.
# Standard form in odd characteristic. If a group has an involution with a 2-component that is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic, the goal is to show that it has a centralizer of involution in &quot;standard form&quot; meaning that a centralizer of involution has a component that is of Lie type in odd characteristic and also has a centralizer of 2-rank 1.
# Classification of groups of odd type. The problem is to show that if a group has a centralizer of involution in &quot;standard form&quot; then it is a group of Lie type of odd characteristic. This was solved by Aschbacher&#x27;s classical involution theorem.
# Quasi-standard form
# Central involutions
# Classification of alternating groups.
# Some sporadic groups
# Thin groups. The simple thin finite groups, those with 2-local &quot;p&quot;-rank at most 1 for odd primes &quot;p&quot;, were classified by Aschbacher in 1978
# Groups with a strongly p-embedded subgroup for &quot;p&quot; odd
# The signalizer functor method for odd primes. The main problem is to prove a signalizer functor theorem for nonsolvable signalizer functors. This was solved by McBride in 1982.
# Groups of characteristic &quot;p&quot; type. This is the problem of groups with a strongly &quot;p&quot;-embedded 2-local subgroup with &quot;p&quot; odd, which was handled by Aschbacher.
# Quasithin groups. A quasithin group is one whose 2-local subgroups have &quot;p&quot;-rank at most 2 for all odd primes &quot;p&quot;, and the problem is to classify the simple ones of characteristic 2 type. This was completed by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004.
# Groups of low 2-local 3-rank. This was essentially solved by Aschbacher&#x27;s trichotomy theorem for groups with &quot;e&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)=3. The main change is that 2-local 3-rank is replaced by 2-local &quot;p&quot;-rank for odd primes.
# Centralizers of 3-elements in standard form. This was essentially done by the Trichotomy theorem.
# Classification of simple groups of characteristic 2 type. This was handled by the Gilman–Griess theorem, with 3-elements replaced by &quot;p&quot;-elements for odd primes.

===Timeline of the proof===

Many of the items in the table below are taken from . The date given is usually the publication date of the complete proof of a result, which is sometimes several years later than the proof or first announcement of the result, so some of the items appear in the &quot;wrong&quot; order.
==Second-generation classification==
The proof of the theorem, as it stood around 1985 or so, can be called &quot;first generation&quot;. Because of the extreme length of the first generation proof, much effort has been devoted to finding a simpler proof, called a second-generation classification proof. This effort, called &quot;revisionism&quot;, was originally led by Daniel Gorenstein.

, ten volumes of the second generation proof have been published (Gorenstein, Lyons &amp; Solomon 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2018a, 2018b; &amp; Capdeboscq, 2021, 2023). In 2012 Solomon estimated that the project would need another 5 volumes, but said that progress on them was slow. It is estimated that the new proof will eventually fill approximately 5,000 pages. (This length stems in part from the second generation proof being written in a more relaxed style.) However, with the publication of volume 9 of the GLS series, and including the Aschbacher–Smith contribution, this estimate was already reached, with several more volumes still in preparation (the rest of what was originally intended for volume 9, plus projected volumes 10 and 11). Aschbacher and Smith wrote their two volumes devoted to the quasithin case in such a way that those volumes can be part of the second generation proof.

Gorenstein and his collaborators have given several reasons why a simpler proof is possible.
* The most important thing is that the correct, final statement of the theorem is now known. Simpler techniques can be applied that are known to be adequate for the types of groups we know to be finite simple. In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the Janko groups) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.
*Because the conclusion was unknown, the first generation proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much of the work of proving these theorems was devoted to the analysis of numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.
*Many first generation theorems overlap, and so divide the possible cases in inefficient ways. As a result, families and subfamilies of finite simple groups were identified multiple times. The revised proof eliminates these redundancies by relying on a different subdivision of cases.
*Finite group theorists have more experience at this sort of exercise, and have new techniques at their disposal.

 has called the work on the classification problem by Ulrich Meierfrankenfeld, Bernd Stellmacher, Gernot Stroth, and a few others, a third generation program. One goal of this is to treat all groups in characteristic 2 uniformly using the amalgam method.

===Length of proof===

Gorenstein has discussed some of the reasons why there might not be a short proof of the classification similar to the classification of compact Lie groups.

*The most obvious reason is that the list of simple groups is quite complicated: with 26 sporadic groups there are likely to be many special cases that have to be considered in any proof. So far no one has yet found a clean uniform description of the finite simple groups similar to the parameterization of the compact Lie groups by Dynkin diagrams.
*Atiyah and others have suggested that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated with a simple group. In some sense, the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes at the end of a very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.
*Another suggestion for simplifying the proof is to make greater use of representation theory. The problem here is that representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank, one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In the early days of the classification, there was a considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.

<text>The Chalcolithic ( ) (also called the Copper Age and Eneolithic) was an archaeological period characterized by the increasing use of smelted copper. It followed the Neolithic and preceded the Bronze Age. It occurred at different periods in different areas, but was absent in some parts of the world, such as Russia, where there was no well-defined Copper Age between the Stone and Bronze Ages. Stone tools were still predominantly used during this period.

The Chalcolithic covers both the early cold working (hammering) of near pure copper ores, as exhibited by the likes of North American Great Lakes Old Copper complex, from around 6,500 BC, through the later copper smelting cultures. The archaeological site of Belovode, on Rudnik mountain in Serbia, has the world&#x27;s oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting at high temperature, from . The transition from Copper Age to Bronze Age in Europe occurred between the late 5th and the late In the Ancient Near East the Copper Age covered about the same period, beginning in the late and lasting for about a millennium before it gave rise to the Early Bronze Age.

A study in the journal &quot;Antiquity&quot; from 2013 reporting the discovery of a tin bronze foil from the Pločnik archaeological site dated to , as well as 14 other artefacts from Bulgaria and Serbia dated to before 4,000 BC, showed that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought and developed independently in Europe 1,500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the Near East. In Britain, the Chalcolithic is a short period between about 2,500 and 2,200 BC, characterized by the first appearance of objects of copper and gold, a new ceramic culture and the immigration of Beaker culture people, heralding the end of the local late Neolithic.

==Terminology==

The multiple names result from multiple definitions of the period. Originally, the term Bronze Age meant that either copper or bronze was being used as the chief hard substance for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Ancient writers, who provided the essential cultural references for educated people during the 19th century, used the same name for both copper- and bronze-using ages.

The concept of the Copper Age was put forward by Hungarian scientist Ferenc Pulszky in the 1870s, when, on the basis of the significant number of large copper objects unearthed within the Carpathian Basin, he suggested that the previous threefold division of the Prehistoric Age – the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages – should be further divided with the introduction of the Copper Age.

In 1881, John Evans recognized that use of copper often preceded the use of bronze, and distinguished between a &quot;transitional Copper Age&quot; and the &quot;Bronze Age proper&quot;. He did not include the transitional period in the Bronze Age, but described it separately from the customary stone / bronze / iron system, at the Bronze Age&#x27;s beginning. He did not, however, present it as a fourth age but chose to retain the tripartite system.

In 1884, Gaetano Chierici, perhaps following the lead of Evans, renamed it in Italian as the &quot;eneo-litica&quot;, or &quot;bronze–stone&quot; transition. The phrase was never intended to mean that the period was the only one in which both bronze and stone were used. The Copper Age features the use of copper, excluding bronze; moreover, stone continued to be used throughout both the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The part &quot;-litica&quot; simply names the Stone Age as the point from which the transition began and is not another &quot;-lithic&quot; age.

Subsequently, British scholars used either Evans&#x27;s &quot;Copper Age&quot; or the term &quot;Eneolithic&quot; (or Æneolithic), a translation of Chierici&#x27;s &quot;eneo-litica&quot;. After several years, a number of complaints appeared in the literature that &quot;Eneolithic&quot; seemed to the untrained eye to be produced from &quot;e-neolithic&quot;, &quot;outside the Neolithic&quot;, clearly not a definitive characterization of the Copper Age. Around 1900, many writers began to substitute &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; for Eneolithic, to avoid the false segmentation. The term chalcolithic is a combination of two words- Chalco+Lithic, derived from the Greek words &quot;khalkos&quot; meaning &quot;copper&quot;, and &quot;líthos&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot;.

But &quot;chalcolithic&quot; could also mislead: For readers unfamiliar with the Italian language, &quot;chalcolithic&quot; seemed to suggest another &quot;-lithic&quot; age, paradoxically part of the Stone Age despite the use of copper. Today, &quot;Copper Age&quot;, &quot;Eneolithic&quot;, and &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; are used synonymously to mean Evans&#x27;s original definition of Copper Age.

==Regions==

===Near East===

The emergence of metallurgy may have occurred first in the Fertile Crescent.

Lead may have been the first ore that humans smelted, since it can be easily obtained by heating galena.

Possible early examples of lead smelting, supported by the extreme rarity of native lead, include: lead beads, found on Level IX of Chatal/Çatal Hüyük in central Anatolia, though they might be made of galena, cerussite, or metallic lead, and accordingly might or might not be evidence of early smelting; a lead bead, found in a GK59 group test square in the 4th level of Jarmo, dated to the 7th millennium BCE, though it is small enough that its human usage is doubtful; a lead bracelet, found in level XII of Yarim Tepe I, dated to the 6th millennium BC; a small cone-shaped piece of lead, found in the &quot;Burnt House&quot; in TT6 at Arpachiyah, dated to the Halaf period or slightly later than the Yarim Tepe bracelet; and more.

Copper smelting is also documented at this site at about the same time period (soon after 6000 BC). However, the use of lead seems to precede copper smelting. Early metallurgy is also documented at the nearby site of Tell Maghzaliyah, which seems to be dated even earlier, and completely lacks pottery.

The Timna Valley contains evidence of copper mining in 7000–5000 BC. The process of transition from Neolithic to Chalcolithic in the Middle East is characterized in archaeological stone tool assemblages by a decline in high quality raw material procurement and use. This dramatic shift is seen throughout the region, including the Tehran Plain, Iran. Here, analysis of six archaeological sites determined a marked downward trend in not only material quality, but also in aesthetic variation in the lithic artefacts. Fazeli &amp; Coningham use these results as evidence of the loss of craft specialisation caused by increased use of copper tools.

The Tehran Plain findings illustrate the effects of the introduction of copper working technologies on the in-place systems of lithic craft specialists and raw materials. Networks of exchange and specialized processing and production that had evolved during the Neolithic seem to have collapsed by the Middle Chalcolithic () and been replaced by the use of local materials by a primarily household-based production of stone tools.

Arsenical copper or bronze was produced in eastern Turkey (Malatya Province) at two ancient sites, Norşuntepe and Değirmentepe, around 4200 BC. According to Boscher (2016), hearths or natural draft furnaces, slag, ore, and pigment had been recovered throughout these sites. This was in the context of Ubaid period architectural complexes typical of southern Mesopotamian architecture. Norşuntepe site demonstrates that some form of arsenic alloying was indeed taking place by the 4th millennium BC. Since the slag identified at Norşuntepe contains no arsenic, this means that arsenic in some form was added separately.

===Europe===
A copper axe found at Prokuplje, Serbia contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper-making, (7,500 years ago). The find in June 2010 extends the known record of copper smelting by about 800 years, and suggests that copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of Asia and Europe at that time rather than spreading from a single source.

In Britain and central and northern Europe a Chalcolithic period has never been defined. However, copper artefacts have been found in archaeological groups. Copper artefacts found in northern Germany and Denmark date from between 4000 and 3300 BC, with most finds dating from 3500 - 3300 BC. They belong to the Funnel Beaker group. The copper was mined in Serbian mines, as researchers from Kiel have recently discovered.

Knowledge of the use of copper was far more widespread than the metal itself. Many European archaeological Cultures used stone axes modeled on copper axes, even with moulding carved in the stone, such as the Battle Axe culture or the late Funnel Beaker Culture. Ötzi the Iceman, who was found in the Ötztal Alps in 1991 and whose remains have been dated to about 3300 BC, was found with a Mondsee copper axe.

Examples of Chalcolithic cultures in Europe include Vila Nova de São Pedro and Los Millares on the Iberian Peninsula. Pottery of the Beaker people has been found at both sites, dating to several centuries after copper-working began there. The Beaker culture appears to have spread copper and bronze technologies in Europe, along with Indo-European languages. In Britain, copper was used between the 25th and , but some archaeologists do not recognise a British Chalcolithic because production and use was on a small scale.

===South Asia===
Ceramic similarities between the Indus Valley civilisation, southern Turkmenistan, and northern Iran during 4300–3300 BC of the Chalcolithic period suggest considerable mobility and trade.

The term &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; has also been used in the context of the South Asian Stone Age.

In Bhirrana, the earliest Indus civilization site, copper bangles and arrowheads were found. The inhabitants of Mehrgarh in present-day Pakistan fashioned tools with local copper ore between 7000 and 3300 BC.

The Nausharo site was a pottery workshop in province of Balochistan, Pakistan, that dates to 4,500 years ago; 12 blades and blade fragments were excavated there. These blades are long, wide, and relatively thin. Archaeological experiments show that these blades were made with a copper indenter and functioned as a potter&#x27;s tool to trim and shape unfired pottery. Petrographic analysis indicates local pottery manufacturing, but also reveals the existence of a few exotic black-slipped pottery items from the Indus Valley.

In India, Chalcolithic culture flourished in mainly four farming communities – Ahar or Banas, Kayatha, Malwa, and Jorwe. These communities had some common traits like painted pottery and use of copper, but they had a distinct ceramic design tradition. Banas culture (2000–1600 BC) had ceramics with red, white, and black design. Kayatha culture (2450–1700 BC) had ceramics painted with brown colored design. Malwa culture (1900–1400 BC) had profusely decorated pottery with red or black colored design. Jorwe culture (1500–900 BC) had ceramics with matte surface and black-on-red design.

Pandu Rajar Dhibi (2000–1600 BC) is a Chalcolithic site in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is located on the south bank of Ajay River in West Bengal. Blackware, painted Koshi ware, pottery, various ornaments made of pearl and copper, various types of tools, pieces of fabric woven from Shimul cotton thread, human and various animal skeletons, burnt clay fragments have been found at the site.

In March 2018, archaeologists had discovered three carts and copper artifacts including weapons dating to 1800 BC in Sanauli village of Uttar Pradesh. The artifacts belongs to Ochre Coloured Pottery culture.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used which does not include metal ages, though metalworking technology did precede European contact in some areas.

Andean civilizations in South America appear to have independently invented copper smelting.

The term &quot;Chalcolithic&quot; is also applied to American civilizations that already used copper and copper alloys thousands of years before Europeans immigrated. Besides cultures in the Andes and Mesoamerica, the Old Copper complex mined and fabricated copper as tools, weapons, and personal ornaments in an area centered in the upper Great Lakes region (present-day Michigan and Wisconsin).

The evidence of smelting or alloying that has been found in North America is subject to some dispute and a common assumption by archaeologists is that objects were cold-worked into shape. Artifacts from some of these sites have been dated to 6500–1000 BC, making them some of the oldest Chalcolithic sites in the world. Some archaeologists find artifactual and structural evidence of casting by Hopewellian and Mississippian peoples to be demonstrated in the archaeological record.

===East Asia===
In the 5th millennium BC copper artifacts start to appear in East Asia, such as in the Jiangzhai and Hongshan cultures, but those metal artifacts were not widely used during this early stage.

Copper manufacturing gradually appeared in the Yangshao period (5000–3000 BC). Jiangzhai is the only site where copper artifacts were found in the Banpo culture. Archaeologists have found remains of copper metallurgy in various cultures from the late fourth to the early third millennia BC. These include the copper-smelting remains and copper artifacts of the Hongshan culture (4700–2900) and copper slag at the Yuanwozhen site. This indicates that inhabitants of the Yellow River valley had already learned how to make copper artifacts by the later Yangshao period.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

In the region of the Aïr Mountains, Niger, independent copper smelting developed between 3000 and 2500 BC. The process was not in a developed state, indicating smelting was not foreign. It became mature about 1500 BC.

<text>Laws restricting, regulating, or banning circumcision, some dating back to ancient times, have been enacted in many countries and communities. In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision of children, proponents of laws in favor of the procedure often point to the rights of the parents or practitioners, namely the right of freedom of religion. Those against the procedure point to the boy&#x27;s right of freedom from religion. In several court cases, judges have pointed to the irreversible nature of the act, the grievous harm to the boy&#x27;s body, and the right to self-determination, and bodily integrity.

== History==

=== Judaism ===

There are ancient religious requirements for circumcision. The Hebrew Bible commands Jews to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male slaves.

Laws which ban circumcision are also ancient. The ancient Greeks prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision. 1 Maccabees, 1:60–61 states that King Antiochus IV of Syria, the occupying power of Judea in 170 BCE, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death, one of the grievances leading to the Maccabean Revolt.

According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, the Roman emperor Hadrian issued a decree which banned circumcision in the empire, and some modern scholars argue that this was a main cause of the Jewish Bar Kokhba revolt of 132 CE. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, however, made no mention of such a law, instead, he blamed the Jewish uprising on Hadrian&#x27;s decision to rebuild Jerusalem and rename it Aelia Capitolina, a city dedicated to Jupiter.

Antoninus Pius permitted Jews to circumcise their own sons. However, he forbade the circumcision of non-Jewish males who were either foreign-born slaves of Jews and the circumcision of non-Jewish males who were members of Jewish households, in violation of Genesis 17:12. He also banned non-Jewish men from converting to Judaism. Antoninus Pius exempted the Egyptian priesthood from the otherwise universal ban on circumcision.

Constantine the Great made it illegal to circumcise Christian slaves, and punished the owners who allowed it by freeing the Christian from slavery.

=== Ecclesiastical canon law in Christianity ===

Circumcision has also played a major role in Christian history and theology. The Council of Jerusalem in the early Christian Church declared that circumcision was not necessary for Christians; covenant theology largely views the Christian sacrament of baptism as fulfilling the Israelite practice of circumcision, both being signs and seals of the covenant of grace. Though mainstream Christian denominations maintain a neutral position on routine circumcision, it is widely practiced in many Christian communities.

Historically, the Lutheran Churches have also not practiced circumcision among their communicants. Currently the Catholic Church maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision. Today, many Christian denominations are neutral about ritual male circumcision, not requiring it for religious observance, but neither forbidding it for cultural or other reasons.

On the other hand, in Oriental Christianity, the Coptic Orthodox Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church require that their male members undergo circumcision.

=== Soviet Union ===
Before glasnost, according to an article in &quot;The Jewish Press&quot;, Jewish ritual circumcision was forbidden in the Soviet Union. However, David E. Fishman, professor of Jewish History at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, states that, whereas the &quot;heder&quot; and &quot;yeshiva&quot;, the organs of Jewish education, &quot;were banned by virtue of the law separating church and school, and subjected to tough police and administrative actions&quot;, circumcision was not proscribed by law or suppressed by executive measures.
Jehoshua A. Gilboa writes that while circumcision was not officially or explicitly banned, pressure was exerted to make it difficult. &quot;Mohels&quot; in particular were concerned that they could be punished for any health issue that might develop, even if it arose some time after the circumcision.

=== Albania ===
In 1967, all religion in Communist Albania was banned, along with the practice of circumcision. The practice was driven underground and many boys were secretly circumcised.

== International law ==
=== Council of Europe ===
On 1 October 2013, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a non-binding resolution in which they state they are &quot;particularly worried about a category of violation of the physical integrity of children&quot;, and included in this category &quot;circumcision of young boys for religious reasons&quot;. On 7 October, Israel&#x27;s president Shimon Peres wrote a personal missive to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland, to stop the &quot;ban&quot;, arguing: &quot;The Jewish communities across Europe would be greatly afflicted to see their cultural and religious freedom impeded upon by the Council of Europe, an institution devoted to the protection of these very rights.&quot; Two days later, Jagland clarified that the resolution was non-binding and that &quot;Nothing in the body of our legally binding standards would lead us to put on equal footing the issue of female genital mutilation and the circumcision of young boys for religious reasons.&quot;

=== European Union === 
A study commissioned by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs published in February 2013 stated that &quot;Male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons appears to be practiced with relative regularity and frequency throughout Europe,&quot; and said it was &quot;the only scenario, among the topics discussed in the present chapter, in which the outcome of the balancing between the right to physical integrity and religious freedom is in favour of the latter.&quot; The study recommended that &quot;the best interests of children should be paramount, while acknowledging the relevance of this practice for Muslims and Jews. Member States should ensure that circumcision of underage children is performed according to the medical profession&#x27;s art and under conditions that do not put the health of minors at risk. The introduction of regulations by the Member States in order to set the conditions and the appropriate medical training for those called to perform it is warranted.&quot;

=== 2013 Nordic ombudsmen statement ===
On 30 September 2013, the children&#x27;s ombudsmen of all five Nordic countries – Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden – together with the children&#x27;s spokesperson from Greenland and representatives of associations of Nordic paediatricians and paediatric surgeons, gathered in Oslo to discuss the issue, and released a joint declaration proposing a ban on non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors:

== Modern laws by country ==

As of February 2018, no European country has a ban on male circumcision.

Whereas child custody regulations have been applied to cases involving circumcision, there seems to be no state which currently unequivocally bans infant male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons, albeit the legality of such circumcision is disputed in some legislations.

The present table provides a non-exhaustive overview comparing legal restrictions and requirements on non-therapeutic infant circumcision in several countries. Some countries require one or both parents to consent to the operation; some of these (Finland, United Kingdom) have experienced legal battles between parents when one of them had their son&#x27;s circumcision carried out or planned without the other&#x27;s consent. Some countries require the procedure to be performed by or supervised by a qualified physician (or a qualified nurse in Sweden), and with (local) anaesthesia applied to the boy or man.

=== Australia ===
The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) finds that routine infant circumcision is not warranted in Australia and New Zealand and that, since circumcision involves physical injury, physicians ought to raise and consider with parents and considered the option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself:

In 1993, a non-binding research paper of the Queensland Law Reform Commission (&quot;Circumcision of Male Infants&quot;) concluded that &quot;On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act,&quot; and that doctors who perform circumcision on male infants may be liable to civil claims by that child at a later date. No prosecutions have occurred in Queensland, and circumcisions continue to be performed.

In 1999, a Perth man won A$360,000 in damages after a doctor admitted he botched a circumcision operation at birth which left the man with a badly deformed penis.

In 2002, Queensland police charged a father with grievous bodily harm for having his two sons, then aged nine and five, circumcised without the knowledge and against the wishes of the mother. The mother and father were in a family court dispute. The charges were dropped when the police prosecutor revealed that he did not have all family court paperwork in court and the magistrate refused to grant an adjournment.

Cosmetic circumcision for newborn males is currently banned in all Australian public hospitals, South Australia being the last state to adopt the ban in 2007; the procedure was not forbidden from being performed in private hospitals. In the same year, the Tasmanian President of the Australian Medical Association, Haydn Walters, stated that they would support a call to ban circumcision for non-medical, non-religious reasons. In 2009, the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute released its Issues Paper investigating the law relating to male circumcision in Tasmania, it &quot;highlights the uncertainty in relation to whether doctors can legally perform circumcision on infant males&quot;.

The Tasmania Law Reform Institute released its recommendations for reform of Tasmanian law relative to male circumcision on 21 August 2012. The report makes fourteen recommendations for reform of Tasmanian law relative to male circumcision.

=== Belgium ===
The Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics finds that circumcision is a radical operation, and that physical integrity of the child takes precedence over parents&#x27; belief systems.

In 2012, &quot;Le Soir&quot; reported a 21% increase in the amount of circumcisions in Belgium from 2006 and 2011. In the previous 25 years, one in three Belgian-born boys had allegedly been circumcised. A questionnaire to hospitals in Wallonia and Brussels showed that about 80 to 90% of the procedures had religious or cultural motives. The Ministry of Health stressed the importance of safe circumstances, physicians warned that &quot;no surgical procedure is without risk&quot; and that circumcision was &quot;not a necessary procedure&quot;.

In 2017, it was estimated that about 15% of Belgian men were circumcised. The incidence has been gradually rising: in 2002, about 17,800 boys or men underwent circumcision, which increased to almost 26,200 in 2016. The expenses of undergoing circumcision are covered by the National Institute for Disease and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI), costing about 2.7 million euros in 2016. After inquiries were submitted to the Belgian Bioethics Advisory Committee in early 2014, an ethics commission was set up to review the morality of covering the costs of medically unnecessary surgery through taxpayer money, especially considering that many taxpayers regard the practice as immoral. By July 2017, the commission reportedly reached consensus on discontinuing the financial coverage of non-medical circumcision, but was still debating whether to advise the government to institute a total ban of the practice. The commission&#x27;s final (non-binding) recommendation, presented on 19 September 2017, was to cease public funding for non-medical circumcision, and to not circumcise anyone underage until they can consent or reject the procedure after being properly informed. This was in line with the 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child, and mirrors the 2013 non-binding Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&#x27;s resolution against underage non-therapeutic circumcision. However, Health Minister Maggie De Block rejected the commission&#x27;s advice, arguing the RIZIV &quot;cannot know whether there is a medical motive or not&quot; when parents request a circumcision, and when they are denied a professional procedure, chances are parents will have a non-expert perform it, leading to worse results for the children. The Health Minister&#x27;s response was received with mixed reactions.

=== Canada ===

The Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend routine circumcision, finding that medical necessity has not been clearly established, and as such, that it should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make his own choices.

According to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia:

=== Denmark ===
Circumcision is legal in Denmark, and each year 1,000 to 2,000 boys are circumcised for non-medical reasons, the Danish Health Authority estimated in 2013, with most circumcisions being performed on Muslim or Jewish boys in private clinics or private homes. For boys below the age of 15, circumcision requires consent from the parents, while the boy can consent when he is 15 years or older. Circumcision is classified as an operation and reserved for doctors, though the responsible doctor can delegate the actual operation to non-medical person, as long as the doctor is present. The operation requires &quot;sufficient pain relief (analgesic) and sedation (Anesthesia)&quot; The doctor is responsible for having the necessary qualifications (both for the operation and the pain relief) and for being informed about the newest scientific developments in the area.

The current guidelines for non-medical circumcision are from 2013, and , a committee under the Danish Patient Health Authority are in the process of updating them. In August 2020, the Danish Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine withdrew from the committee, because they disagreed with the Authority&#x27;s opinion that local anaesthesia was sufficient, instead saying the scientific literature showed that general anaesthesia was necessary. Other professional organizations followed them, and according to DR, only the Authority and two private clinics that perform circumcisions remain in the committee.

The Danish population overwhelmingly support a ban on non-medical circumcision of boys below the age of 18. A 2020 survey measured the support at 86%, while surveys in 2018, 2016 and 2014 measured the support at 83%, 87% and 74%, respectively In 2018, a citizen&#x27;s initiative calling for such a ban reached the threshold of 50.000 signatures to be put forward in the Folketing. It was subsequently found compliant with the Danish Constitution, in particularly §67 on religious freedom. The Danish Medical Association believes boys should decide for themselves after they turn 18 years old, but does not call for a ban. Politicians are hesitant in supporting a ban, with protection of religious freedom, in particular the Jewish practice of circumcision, and potential foreign policy and national security ramifications mentioned as some of the reasons. , the Social Democrats and Venstre, who together hold a majority in the Folketing, oppose a ban, while the Danish People&#x27;s Party, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, Red-Green Alliance, The Alternative, The New Right and Liberal Alliance favour a ban. The Conservative and the Social Liberal Party have no official opinion on the question.

===Finland===
The Finnish Ombudsman for Equality finds that circumcising young boys without a medical reason is legally highly questionable, The Finnish Supreme Court found that non-therapeutic circumcision of boys is assault, and the Finnish Ombudsman for Children proposed that Finland should ban non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys: 
In August 2006, a Finnish court ruled that the circumcision of a four-year-old boy arranged by his mother, who is Muslim, to be an illegal assault. The boy&#x27;s father, who had not been consulted, reported the incident to the police. A local prosecutor stated that the prohibition of circumcision is not gender-specific in Finnish law. A lawyer for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health stated that there is neither legislation nor prohibition on male circumcision, and that &quot;the operations have been performed on the basis of common law.&quot; The case was appealed and in October 2008 the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that the circumcision, &quot;carried out for religious and social reasons and in a medical manner, did not have the earmarks of a criminal offence. It pointed out in its ruling that the circumcision of Muslim boys is an established tradition and an integral part of the identity of Muslim men&quot;. In 2008, the Finnish government was reported to be considering a new law to legalise circumcision if the practitioner is a doctor and if the child consents. In December 2011, Helsinki District Court said that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision does not mean that circumcision is legal for any non-medical reasons. The court referred to the Convention on Human rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe, which was ratified in Finland in 2010.

In February 2010, a Jewish couple were fined for causing bodily harm to their then infant son who was circumcised in 2008 by a mohel brought in from the UK. Normal procedure for persons of Jewish faith in Finland is to have a locally certified mohel who works in Finnish healthcare perform the operation. In the 2008 case, the infant was not anesthetized and developed complications that required immediate hospital care. The parents were ordered to pay 1500 euros in damages to their child.

In November 2020, the Finnish Parliament passed a new law on female genital mutilation. An earlier version of the draft law could also have criminalised nonmedical infant circumcision, but due to intense lobbying by several Islamic and Jewish organisations including the Central Council of Finnish Jewish Communities, Milah UK, and the European Jewish Congress, the wording was changed and instead, the law passed in Parliament now states that the issue of circumcision of boys should be &quot;clarified&quot; in the future.

=== Germany ===

The German Association of Pediatricians (BVKJ) finds no medical reason for non-therapeutic circumcision and that the AAP (2012) recommendation scientifically unsustainable, and that boys should have the same constitutional legal right to physical integrity as girls:

In October 2006, a Turkish national who performed ritual circumcisions on seven boys was convicted of causing dangerous bodily harm by the state court in Düsseldorf.

In September 2007, a Frankfurt am Main appeals court found that the circumcision of an 11-year-old boy without his approval was an unlawful personal injury. The boy, whose parents were divorced, was visiting his Muslim father during a vacation when his father forced him to be ritually circumcised. The boy had planned to sue his father for .

In May 2012, the Cologne regional appellate court ruled that religious circumcision of male children amounts to bodily injury, and is a criminal offense in the area under its jurisdiction. The decision based on the article &quot;Criminal Relevance of Circumcising Boys. A Contribution to the Limitation of Consent in Cases of Care for the Person of the Child&quot; published by Holm Putzke, a German law professor at the University of Passau. The court arrived at its judgment by application of the human rights provisions of the Basic Law, a section of the Civil Code, and some sections of the Criminal Code to non-therapeutic circumcision of male children. Some observers said it could set a legal precedent that criminalizes the practice. Jewish and Muslim groups were outraged by the ruling, viewing it as trampling on freedom of religion.

The German ambassador to Israel, Andreas Michaelis, told Israeli lawmakers that Germany was working to resolve the issue and that it does not apply at a national level, but instead only to the local jurisdiction of the court in Cologne. The Council of the Coordination of Muslims in Germany condemned the ruling, stating that it is &quot;a serious attack on religious freedom&quot;. Ali Kizilkaya, a spokesman of the council, stated that, &quot;The ruling does not take everything into account, religious practice concerning circumcision of young Muslims and Jews has been carried out over the millennia on a global level.&quot; The Roman Catholic archbishop of Aachen, Heinrich Mussinghoff, said that the ruling was &quot;very surprising&quot;, and the contradiction between &quot;basic rights on freedom of religion and the well-being of the child brought up by the judges is not convincing in this very case&quot;. Hans Ulrich Anke, the head of the Protestant Church in Germany, said the ruling should be appealed since it did not &quot;sufficiently&quot; consider the religious significance of the rite. A spokesman, Steffen Seibert, for German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that Jewish and Muslim communities will be free to practice circumcision responsibly, and the government would find a way around the local ban in Cologne. The spokesman stated &quot;For everyone in the government it is absolutely clear that we want to have Jewish and Muslim religious life in Germany. Circumcision carried out in a responsible manner must be possible in this country without punishment.&quot;

In July 2012, a group of rabbis, imams, and others said that they view the ruling against circumcision &quot;an affront on our basic religious and human rights&quot;. The joint statement was signed by leaders of groups including Germany&#x27;s Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, the Islamic Center Brussels, the Rabbinical Centre of Europe, the European Jewish Parliament and the European Jewish Association, who met with members of European Parliament from Germany, Finland, Belgium, Italy, and Poland. European rabbis, who urged Jews to continue circumcision, planned further talks with Muslim and Christian leaders to determine how they can oppose the ban together. The Jewish Hospital of Berlin suspended the practice of male circumcision. On 19 July 2012, a joint resolution of the CDU/CSU, SPD and FDP factions in the Bundestag requesting the executive branch to draft a law permitting circumcision of boys to be performed without unnecessary pain in accordance with best medical practice carried with a broad majority.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the German Medical Association &quot;condemned the ruling for potentially putting children at risk by taking the procedure out of the hands of doctors, but it also warned surgeons note to perform circumcisions for religious reasons until legal clarity was established&quot;. The ruling was supported by Deutsche Kinderhilfe, a German child rights organization, which asked for a two-year moratorium to discuss the issue and pointed out that religious circumcision may contravene the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 24.3: &quot;States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children.&quot;).

The German Academy for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (Deutsche Akademie für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin e.V., DAKJ), the German Association for Pediatric Surgery (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kinderchirurgie, DGKCH) and the Professional Association of Pediatric and Adolescent Physicians (Berufsverband der Kinder- und Jugendärzte) took a firm stand against non-medical routine infant circumcision.

In July, in Berlin, a criminal complaint was lodged against Rabbi Yitshak Ehrenberg for &quot;causing bodily harm&quot; by performing religious circumcision, and for vocal support of the continuation of the practice. In September, the prosecutors dismissed the complaint, concluding that &quot;there is no proof to establish that the rabbi&#x27;s conduct met the &#x27;condition of a criminal&#x27; violation&quot;.

In September, Reuters reported &quot;Berlin&#x27;s senate said doctors could legally circumcise infant boys for religious reasons in its region, given certain conditions.&quot;

On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the Bundestag adopted the proposed law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions; it is now §1631(d) in the German Civil Code. The vote tally was 434 ayes, 100 noes, and 46 abstentions. Following approval by the Bundesrat and signing by the Bundespräsident, the new law became effective on 28 December 2012 a day after its publication in the Federal Gazette.

=== Iceland ===
In May 2005, Iceland amended its General Penal Code to criminalise female genital mutilation

In February 2018, the Progressive Party proposed a bill that would change the words &quot;girl child&quot; to &quot;child&quot; and &quot;her sexual organs&quot; to &quot;[their] sexual organs&quot;, thereby making Iceland the first European country to ban male circumcision for non-medical reasons. The bill was ultimately put on hold later that year following pressure from the United States, Israel, and various lobbyist groups.

=== Ireland ===
The legality of non-therapeutic circumcision of infants is unclear in Ireland. In 2003, an expert in medical law suggested that the Constitution of Ireland&#x27;s guarantees of family autonomy would probably trump concern for the child&#x27;s bodily autonomy. Until the 1990s the practice was largely confined to the brit milah of the small Jewish community, generally performed by a mohel travelling from Great Britain and certified there by the Initiation Society, with no concern from law enforcement. The increased immigration beginning in the Celtic Tiger period included people with Muslim or African traditions of circumcision. 

In August 2003 in Waterford, the 29-day-old son of a Nigerian father and Irish mother died from hemorrhage and shock after an attempted circumcision by a Nigerian &quot;fourth-generation circumcisionist&quot;, who was charged with reckless endangerment. The boy&#x27;s parents had enquired about circumcision within the health service, but such requests were routinely declined by the local health board until a review after the death. At the 2005 trial, the prosecution argued that &quot;the carrying out of a circumcision by a non-medical person was not an offence in Ireland&quot;, but that the accused had failed to provide aftercare support and advice, so that the parents had waited too long (12 hours) before taking the infant to hospital. The judge instructed the jury &#x27;not to bring their &quot;white Western values&quot; to bear upon their deliberations&#x27;; the accused was found not guilty. Kevin Myers commented, &#x27;May you ineptly circumcise an Irish boy-child and cause him to die if you are African because of your &quot;culture&quot;, but not if you are Irish?&#x27; Jurist Máiréad Enright questioned the judge&#x27;s &quot;radical cultural relativism&quot; and felt as a Circuit Court case it had &quot;limited precedential value&quot;.

While the Waterford case was pending, the Minister for Health established an advisory committee on &quot;cultural male circumcision&quot;. Its 2006 report recommended that circumcision be provided within the health service as an outpatient procedure by trained surgeons and anaesthetists. Circumcisions carried out by &quot;untrained people&quot; should be investigated by the Health Service Executive and might be prosecuted as child abuse. In 2020 another Nigerian traditional circumcisionist was jailed for 3 years after pleading guilty to reckless endangerment of a 10-month-old, who spent two weeks in hospital after a 2015 procedure without anaesthetic or proper sterilisation. The judge called it &quot;a barbaric act of cruelty&quot; and said the man should abide by Irish cultural norms. 

On 30 July 2024 a London-based rabbi was arrested after performing a circumcision in a Dublin house with the parents&#x27; consent. He was charged with carrying out a surgical procedure without being a registered medical practitioner, contrary to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. The accused is a mohel registered with the Initiation Society. The Chief Rabbi of Ireland said that the client family was not Jewish, but the Jewish community would be offering assistance to the mohel. &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; suggested the reason the case was singled out for prosecution was because it was a &quot;non-religious circumcision&quot;; &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; linked it to an alleged increase in Irish antisemitism due to the Israel–Hamas war. On 6 August he was remanded for a further two weeks in anticipation of &quot;multiple further charges&quot; from the Director of Public Prosecutions. On 22 August he was granted bail at a hearing which was told no mohel had previously been prosecuted in such a case.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, Jewish circumcision is entirely legal. The circumcision rate is very high in Israel, although some limited data suggests the practice is slowly declining. According to an online survey by the parents&#x27; portal Mamy in 2006, the rate was 95%, while earlier estimates put it at 98–99%. Ben Shalem, an organisation dedicated to the abolition of circumcision, petitioned the Supreme Court in 1999 on the grounds that circumcision violated human dignity, children&#x27;s rights and criminal law. The petition was rejected. In 2013, a Rabbinical court in Israel ordered a mother in the midst of divorce proceedings to circumcise her son in accordance with the father&#x27;s wishes, or pay a fine of 500 Israeli Shekel for every day that the child is not circumcised. She appealed against the Rabbinical court ruling and the High Court ruled in her favour stating, among other considerations, the basic right of freedom from religion.

=== Netherlands ===

The Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) finds non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors to be in conflict with children&#x27;s right to autonomy and physical integrity, and that there are good reasons for its legal prohibition, as exists for female genital mutilation: 
In May 2008 a father who had his two sons, aged 3 and 6, circumcised against the will of their mother was found not guilty of abuse as the circumcision was performed by a physician and due to the court&#x27;s restraint in setting a legal precedent; instead he was given a 6-week suspended jail sentence for taking the boys away from their mother against her will.

The parquet of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands made an elaborate statement on the legal status of circumcision on 5 July 2011 in the course of a criminal case. First, the parquet notes that there is no law that specifically prohibits the circumcision of boys, nor that the practice falls under the more general crime of &quot;(zware) mishandeling&quot; (&#x27;(grave) assault&#x27;). &quot;Genital mutilation of girls in any case undoubtedly falls under &quot;(zware) mishandeling&quot; (Art. 300–303 Dutch Criminal Code). Whereas most forms of genital cutting of girls are generally marked as genital mutilation, a similar communis opinio regarding genital cutting of boys does not yet exist so far.&quot; The Supreme Court acknowledged that society&#x27;s attitudes on genital cutting of boys had been gradually shifting over the course of years, and that &quot;the increasing concern [in the medical world] about the harm and the risk of complications during a circumcision is indeed relevant&quot;, but that overall there were not enough reasons yet to proceed to criminalisation. Neither could intentional infliction of grave bodily harm (Art. 82 Dutch Criminal Code) be applied to the normal circumstances of a competently and hygienically performed circumcision in a clinic. And because young children are incapable of exercising the right to self-determination, parents ought to do this on their behalf. They can both request a circumcision to be performed, as well as consent to it being performed, on the grounds of their parental authority. However, it is important that both parents consent to the procedure.

=== Norway ===
The Norwegian Ombudsman for Children (&quot;Barneombudet&quot;) opposes circumcising children, and stated on 29 September 2013 that it is right to wait until children are old enough to decide for themselves: 
In June 2012, the centre-right Centre Party proposed a ban on circumcision on males under eighteen, after an Oslo infant died in May following a circumcision.

A bill on ritual circumcision of boys was passed (against two votes) in the Norwegian Parliament in June 2014, with the new law going into effect on 1 January 2015. This law explicitly allows Jews to practice brit milah and obligates the Norwegian Health Care regions to offer the Muslim minority a safe and affordable procedure. Local anaesthesia needs to be applied and a licensed physician needs to be present at the circumcision, which hospitals started to perform in March 2015.

In May 2017, the right-wing Progress Party proposed to ban circumcision for males under sixteen.

=== South Africa ===
The Children&#x27;s Act 2005 makes the circumcision of male children under 16 unlawful except for religious or medical reasons. In the Eastern Cape province the Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act, 2001, regulates traditional circumcision, which causes the death or mutilation of many youths by traditional surgeons each year. Among other provisions, the minimum age for circumcision is age 18.

In 2004, a 22-year-old Rastafarian convert was forcibly circumcised by a group of Xhosa tribal elders and relatives. When he first fled, two police returned him to those who had circumcised him. In another case, a medically circumcised Xhosa man was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. According to South African newspapers, the subsequent trial became &quot;a landmark case around forced circumcision&quot;. In October 2009, the Eastern Cape High Court at Bhisho (sitting as an Equality Court) clarified that circumcision is unlawful unless done with the full consent of the initiate.

=== Slovenia ===
The Slovenian Human Rights Ombudsman found in February 2012, after consulting various relevant expert bodies and studying relevant constitutional and legal stipulations, that circumcision for non-medical reasons is a violation of children&#x27;s rights, that ritual circumcision for religious reasons is unacceptable in Slovenia for both legal and ethical reasons and should not be performed by doctors:

=== Sweden ===
In 2001, the Parliament of Sweden enacted a law allowing only persons certified by the National Board of Health to circumcise infants. It requires a medical doctor or an anesthesia nurse to accompany the circumciser and for anaesthetic to be applied beforehand. After the first two months of life circumcisions can only be performed by a physician. The stated purpose of the law was to increase the safety of the procedure.

Swedish Jews and Muslims objected to the law, and in 2001, the World Jewish Congress called it &quot;the first legal restriction on Jewish religious practice in Europe since the Nazi era&quot;. The requirement for an anaesthetic to be administered by a medical professional is a major issue, and the low degree of availability of certified professionals willing to conduct circumcision has also been subject to criticism. According to a survey, two out of three paediatric surgeons said they refuse to perform non-therapeutic circumcision, and less than half of all county councils offer it in their hospitals. However, in 2006, the U.S. State Department stated, in a report on Sweden, that most Jewish mohels had been certified under the law and 3000 Muslim and 40–50 Jewish boys were circumcised each
year. An estimated 2000 of these are performed by persons who are neither physicians nor have officially recognised certification.

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare reviewed the law in 2005 and recommended that it be maintained, but found that the law had failed with regard to the intended consequence of increasing the safety of circumcisions. A later report by the Board criticised the low level of availability of legal circumcisions, partly due to reluctance among health professionals. To remedy this, the report suggested a new law obliging all county councils to offer non-therapeutic circumcision in their hospitals, but this was later abandoned in favour of a non-binding recommendation.

In January 2014, the Swedish Medical Association (SLF) found no known medical benefits to circumcision of children, and thus strong reasons to wait until the boy is old and mature enough (12 or 13 years old) to give informed consent, aiming at ceasing all non-medically justified circumcision without prior consent:

In October 2018, the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats party submitted a draft motion to parliament calling for a ban. At the annual conference of the Centre Party in September 2019, 314 to 166 commissioners voted in favor of prohibiting boys&#x27; circumcision. Several Jewish and Islamic organisations voiced their opposition to a potential ban. The Left Party has also expressed support for a prohibition on circumcising boys before the age of 18; other parties have so far not backed a potential ban, though the Green Party found the practice &quot;problematic&quot;.

=== Switzerland ===
According to a July 2012 survey by &quot;20 Minuten&quot; involving 8,000 participants, 64% of the Swiss population wanted religious circumcision to be banned. 67% of men and 56% of women were in favour. 93% of Muslim respondents and 75% of Jewish respondents opposed a ban. Over 25% of male respondents were themselves circumcised; 96% of Muslim men and 89% of Jewish men in the survey said they were circumcised, while 20% of circumcised men belonged to neither religion. Almost a third of circumcised men favoured a ban, with 12% wishing in hindsight that they had not been circumcised.

=== United Kingdom ===
Male circumcision has traditionally been presumed to be legal under British law, however some authors have argued that there is no solid foundation for this view in English law.

While legal, the British Medical Association finds it ethically unacceptable to circumcise a child or young person, either with or without competence, who refuses the procedure, irrespective of the parents&#x27; wishes, and that parental preference alone does not constitute sufficient grounds for performing NTMC on a child unable to express his own view:

The passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 has led to some speculation that the lawfulness of the circumcision of male children is unclear.

One 1999 case, &quot;Re &quot;J&quot; (child&#x27;s religious upbringing and circumcision)&quot; said that circumcision in Britain required the consent of all those with parental responsibility (however this comment was not part of the reason for the judgement and therefore is not legally binding), or the permission of the court, acting for the best interests of the child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing Muslim father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without medical necessity; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father for no good reason, refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.

In 2001 the General Medical Council had found a doctor who had botched circumcision operations guilty of abusing his professional position and that he had acted &quot;inappropriately and irresponsibly&quot;, and struck him off the register. A doctor who had referred patients to him, and who had pressured a mother into agreeing to the surgery, was also condemned. He was put on an 18-month period of review and retraining, and was allowed to resume unrestricted practice as a doctor in March 2003, after a committee found that he had complied with conditions it placed on him. According to the &quot;Northern Echo&quot;, he &quot;told the committee he has now changed his approach to circumcision referrals, accepting that most cases can be treated without the need for surgery&quot;.

Fox and Thomson (2005) argue that consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision. They say there is &quot;no compelling legal authority for the common view that circumcision is lawful&quot;.

In 2005 a Muslim man had his son circumcised against the wishes of the child&#x27;s mother who was the custodial parent.

In 2009 it was reported that a 20-year-old man whose father had him ritually circumcised as a baby is preparing to sue the doctor who circumcised him. This is believed to be the first time a person who was circumcised as an infant has made a claim in the UK. The case is expected to be heard in 2010.

In a 2015 case regarding female circumcision, a judge concluded that non-therapeutic circumcision of male children is a &quot;significant harm&quot;. In 2016, the Family Court in Exeter ruled that a Muslim father could not have his two sons (aged 6 and 4) circumcised after their mother disagreed. Mrs Justice Roberts declared that the boys should first grow old enough &quot;to the point where each of the boys themselves will make their individual choices once they have the maturity and insight to appreciate the consequences and longer-term effects of the decisions which they reach&quot;.

==== Nottingham case ====

In June 2017, Nottinghamshire Police arrested three people on suspicion of &quot;conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm&quot;. The alleged victim was purportedly circumcised while in its Muslim father&#x27;s care at his grandparents&#x27; in July 2013 without the consent of his mother (a non-religious white British woman who conceived the child after a casual affair with the man, whom she had separated from after the incident). The mother first contacted social services and eventually the police in November 2014. The police initially dismissed the complaint, but after the mother got help from the anti-circumcision group Men Do Complain and leading human rights lawyer Saimo Chahal QC, they reopened the case, and ended up arresting three suspects involved. In November 2017, the Crown Prosecution Service explained to the mother in a letter they were not going to prosecute the doctor, who claimed he was unaware of the mother&#x27;s non-consent. However, Chahal appealed this decision, which she said &quot;lacks any semblance of a considered and reasoned decision and is flawed and irrational&quot;, and threatened to bring the case to court. The by then 29-year-old mother finally sued the doctor in April 2018. Niall McCrae, mental health expert from King&#x27;s College London, argued that this case could mean &quot;the end of ritual male circumcision in the UK&quot;, drawing comparisons with earlier rulings against female genital mutilation.

=== United States ===

Circumcision of adults who grant personal informed consent for the surgical operation is legal.

In the United States, non-therapeutic circumcision of male children has long been assumed to be lawful in every jurisdiction provided that one parent grants surrogate informed consent. Adler (2013) has recently challenged the validity of this assumption. As with every country, doctors who circumcise children must take care that all applicable rules regarding informed consent and safety are satisfied.

While anti-circumcision groups have occasionally proposed legislation banning non-therapeutic child circumcision, it has not been supported in any legislature. After a failed attempt to adopt a local ordinance banning circumcision on a San Francisco ballot, the state of California enacted in October 2011 a law protecting circumcision from local attempts to ban the practice.

In 2012, New York City required those performing &quot;metzitzah b&#x27;peh&quot;, the oral suction of the open circumcision wound required by Hasidim, to obey stringent consent requirements, including documentation. Agudath Israel of America and other Jewish groups have planned to sue the city in response.

Disputes between parents

Occasionally the courts are asked to make a ruling when parents cannot agree on whether or not to circumcise a child.

In January 2001 a dispute between divorcing parents in New Jersey was resolved when the mother, who sought to have the boy circumcised withdrew her request. The boy had experienced two instances of foreskin inflammation and she wanted to have him circumcised. The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child, objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set. In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement. In July 2001 a dispute between parents in Kansas over circumcision was resolved when the mother&#x27;s request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs. (The woman&#x27;s pastor had stated that circumcision was &quot;important&quot; but was not necessary for salvation.) On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.

On 14 July 2004 a mother appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court to prevent the circumcision of her son after a county court and the Court of Appeals had denied her a writ of prohibition. However, in early August 2004, before the Supreme Court had given its ruling, the father, who had custody of the boy, had him circumcised.

In October 2006 a judge in Chicago granted an injunction blocking the circumcision of a 9-year-old boy. In granting the injunction the judge stated that &quot;the boy could decide for himself whether to be circumcised when he turns 18.&quot;

In November 2007, the Oregon Supreme Court heard arguments from a divorced Oregon couple over the circumcision of their son. The father wanted his son, who turned 13 on 2 March 2008, to be circumcised in accordance with the father&#x27;s religious views; the child&#x27;s mother opposes the procedure. The parents dispute whether the boy is in favor of the procedure. A group opposed to circumcision filed briefs in support of the mother&#x27;s position, while some Jewish groups filed a brief in support of the father. On 25 January 2008, the Court returned the case to the trial court with instructions to determine whether the child agrees or objects to the proposed circumcision. The father appealed to the US Supreme Court to allow him to have his son circumcised but his appeal was rejected. The case then returned to the trial court. When the trial court interviewed the couple&#x27;s son, now 14 years old, the boy stated that he did not want to be circumcised. This also provided the necessary circumstances to allow the boy to change residence to live with his mother. The boy was not circumcised.

Other disputes

In September 2004 the North Dakota Supreme Court rejected a mother&#x27;s attempt to prosecute her doctor for circumcising her child without fully informing her of the consequences of the procedure. The judge and jury found that the plaintiffs were adequately informed of possible complications, and the jury further found that it is not incumbent on the doctors to describe every &quot;insignificant&quot; risk.

In March 2009 a Fulton County, GA, State Court jury awarded $2.3 million in damages to a 4-year-old boy and his mother for a botched circumcision in which too much tissue was removed causing permanent disfigurement.

In August 2010 an eight-day-old boy was circumcised in a Florida hospital against the stated wishes of the parents. The hospital admitted that the boy was circumcised by mistake; the mother has sued the hospital and the doctor involved in the case.

<text>Called to Common Mission (CCM) is an agreement between The Episcopal Church (ECUSA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) in the United States, establishing full communion between them. It was ratified by the ELCA in 1999, the ECUSA in 2000, after the narrow failure of a previous agreement. Its principal author on the Episcopal side was theological professor J. Robert Wright. Under the agreement, they recognize the validity of each other&#x27;s baptisms and ordinations. The agreement provided that the ELCA would accept the historical episcopate and the &quot;threefold ministry&quot; of bishop - priest (or pastor) - deacon with respect to ministers of communicant churches serving ELCA congregations; the installation of the ELCA presiding bishop was performed through the laying on of hands by Lutheran bishops in the historic episcopate. This provision was opposed by some in the ELCA, which after its founding merger in 1988, held a lengthy study of the ministry which was undertaken with divided opinions. In response to concerns about the meaning of the CCM, synod bishops in the ELCA drafted the Tucson resolution which presented the official ELCA position. It made clear that there is no requirement to ordain deacons or accept their ministry. It also provided assurance that the ELCA did not and was not required by CCM to change its own theological stance.

Lutheran churches of Scandinavian origin, such as the Church of Sweden and Church in Kenya, affirm apostolic succession and are in the historical episcopate; nevertheless, some within the ELCA argued that the historical episcopate would contradict the doctrine that the church exists wherever the Word of God is preached and sacraments are practiced. The traditional ELCA doctrine is affirmed by the Tucson resolution. Others objected on the grounds that adopting the Episcopalian / Anglican view on priestly orders and hierarchical structure was contrary to the Evangelical Lutheran concept of the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot;, which holds that all Christians stand on equal footing before God. They argued that the Old Covenant required a priest to mediate between God and humanity, but that New Covenant explicitly abolishes the need for priestly role by making every Christian a priest with direct access to God&#x27;s grace. The Tucson resolution explained that the ELCA had not adopted the Episcopal view, but ECUSA or Reformed ordinands accepted by ELCA congregations would follow ELCA practice. Still others objected because of the implied directive that the use of a lay presidency would be abolished. This was a particular issue for rural congregations that periodically &quot;called&quot; a congregation member to conduct communion services consecrating the elements (of bread and wine for service) in the interim period or with the absence of ordained clergy (pastor). The Tucson resolution explicitly affirmed the continued use of lay ministry.

<doc id="7450" wikidata="Q734215" url="?curid=7450" title="Context menu">
<text>A context menu (also called contextual, shortcut, and pop up or pop-up menu) is a menu in a graphical user interface (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click mouse operation. A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. Usually the available choices are actions related to the selected object. From a technical point of view, such a context menu is a graphical control element.

== History ==
Context menus first appeared in the Smalltalk environment on the Xerox Alto computer, where they were called &quot;pop-up menus&quot;; they were invented by Dan Ingalls in the mid-1970s.

Microsoft Office v3.0 introduced the context menu for copy and paste functionality in 1990. Borland demonstrated extensive use of the context menu in 1991 at the Second Paradox Conference in Phoenix Arizona. Lotus 1-2-3/G for OS/2 v1.0 added additional formatting options in 1991. Borland Quattro Pro for Windows v1.0 introduced the Properties context menu option in 1992.

==Implementation==
Context menus are opened via various forms of user interaction that target a region of the GUI that supports context menus. The specific form of user interaction and the means by which a region is targeted vary:

* On a computer running Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Unix running the X Window System, clicking the secondary mouse button (usually the right button) opens a context menu for the region that is under the mouse pointer.
* For quickness, implementations may additionally support hold-and-release selection, meaning the pointer is held down and dragged, and released at desirable menu entry.
* On systems that support one-button mice, context menus are typically opened by pressing and holding the primary mouse button (this works on the icons in the Dock on macOS) or by pressing a keyboard/mouse button combination (e.g. Ctrl-mouse click in Classic Mac OS and macOS). A keyboard alternative for macOS is to enable Mouse keys in Universal Access. Then, depending on whether a laptop or compact or extended keyboard type is used, the shortcut is ++5 or +5 (numeric keypad) or ++i (laptop).
* On systems with a multi-touch interface such as MacBook or Surface, the context menu can be opened by pressing or tapping with two fingers instead of just one.

* Some cameras on smartphones for example recognize a QR code when a picture is taken. Then a pop-up appears if you want to &#x27;open&#x27; the QR content. This could be anything like a website or to configure your phone to connect to Wi-Fi. See image.
* On some user interfaces, context menu items are accompanied by icons for quicker recognition upon navigation. 
* Context menus can also have a top row of icons only for quick access to most frequently used options.

Windows mouse click behavior is such that the context menu doesn&#x27;t open while the mouse button is pressed, but only opens the menu when the button is released, so the user has to click again to select a context menu item. This behavior differs from that of macOS and most free software GUIs.
* In Microsoft Windows, pressing the Application key or Shift+F10 opens a context menu for the region that has focus.

Context menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. The implementations differ: Microsoft Word was one of the first applications to only show sub-entries of some menu entries after clicking an arrow icon on the context menu, otherwise executing an action associated with the parent entry. This makes it possible to quickly repeat an action with the parameters of the previous execution, and to better separate options from actions.

=== X Window Managers ===
The following window managers provide context menu functionality:

* Awesome
* IceWM—middle-click and right-click context menus on desktop, menu bar, title bars, and title icon
* olwm
* openbox
* sawfish

==Usability==
Context menus have received some criticism from usability analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features &quot;only&quot; available in context menus, which may confuse even experienced users (especially when the context menus can only be activated in a limited area of the application&#x27;s client window).

Context menus usually open in a fixed position under the pointer, but when the pointer is near a screen edge the menu will be displaced - thus reducing consistency and impeding use of muscle memory. If the context menu is being triggered by keyboard, such as by using Shift + F10, the context menu appears near the focused widget instead of the position of the pointer, to save recognition efforts.

==In documentation==
Microsoft&#x27;s guidelines call for always using the term &quot;context menu&quot;, and explicitly deprecate &quot;shortcut menu&quot;.

<text>In Judaism, the concept of the Jews as chosen people ( &quot;hāʿām hanīvḥar&quot;) is the belief that the Jews as a people, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are a chosen people, i.e. selected to be in a covenant with God. Israelites being properly the chosen people of God is found directly in the Book of Deuteronomy 7:6 as the verb &quot;baḥar&quot; (בָּחַר), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as &quot;holy people&quot; as &quot;goy&quot; or gentile, Book of Exodus 19:6. Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations—Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen by believers as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah. Isaiah and Jeremiah viewed God&#x27;s loving choice of Israel as a means to teaching monotheism, combatting idolatry, curbing human arrogance, ending violence, lust, greed, extreme chauvinism and warfare, and ushering in a new society.

While the concept of &quot;chosenness&quot; may be understood by some to connote ethnic supremacy, the status as a &quot;chosen people&quot; within Judaism does not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with &quot;all&quot; humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view: Moses refers to the &quot;God of the spirits of all flesh&quot;, the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel and the prophet Jonah is explicitly told to go prophesize to the non-Jewish people of Nineveh. Jewish tradition is clear that there were interactions of non-Jewish prophets with God which are not recounted in the Torah. Based on these statements and stories, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Natan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, &quot;God permitted to some people that which he forbade to others ... [and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.&quot; (Levine, 1907/1966) The Mishnah states that &quot;Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God&#x27;s greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other&quot; (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5).

According to the Israel Democracy Institute, approximately two thirds of Israeli Jews believe that Jews are the &quot;chosen people&quot;.

==Etymological background==
The term &quot;chosen people&quot; is free translated from the biblical terms ʿ&quot;am&quot; &quot;segullah&quot; (“treasure people”) and ʿ&quot;am&quot; &quot;nahallah&quot; (“heritage people”).

==In religious texts==
According to the Torah, the nations which inhabited Can&#x27;an after Jacob left there, violated God&#x27;s laws and were to be vomited out of the land as a result, however their iniquity was not sufficiently great to deserve that result until a few hundred years later, which was when God then brought Jacob&#x27;s descendants back to the land, with a warning that they too would be cast out if they violated God&#x27;s rules regarding idolatry and other &#x27;abominations&#x27;. In Deuteronomy, the Torah states: &quot;when the Lord delivers the Israelites to the land, the other nations will be cast out, and &quot;thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them&quot; Deuteronomy 7:5-7:6,
: &quot;But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. For thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be His own treasure, out of all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.&quot;

A similar passage speaking of Israel as the chosen people follows prohibitions on baldness and cutting yourself in mourning, &quot;For thou art a holy people&quot;.
The Torah also says,
:&quot;Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me from all the peoples, for all the earth is mine.&quot;
God promises that he will never exchange his people with any other:
:&quot;And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.&quot;

Other Torah verses about chosenness,
*&quot;And you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation&quot;
*&quot;The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people; but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your ancestors.&quot;

The obligation imposed upon the Israelites was emphasized by the prophet Amos:
:&quot;You only have I singled out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.&quot;

==Rabbinic views==
Most Jewish texts do not state that &quot;God chose the Jews&quot; by itself. Rather, this is usually linked with a mission or purpose, such as proclaiming God&#x27;s message among all the nations, even though Jews cannot become &quot;unchosen&quot; if they shirk their mission. This implies a special duty, which evolves from the belief that Jews have been pledged by the covenant which God concluded with the biblical patriarch Abraham, their ancestor, and again with the entire Jewish nation at Mount Sinai. In this view, Jews are charged with living a holy life as God&#x27;s priest-people.

In the Jewish prayerbook (the Siddur), chosenness is referred to in a number of ways. The blessing for reading the Torah reads, &quot;Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who has chosen us out of all the nations and bestowed upon us His Torah.&quot; In the &quot;Kiddush&quot;, a prayer of sanctification, in which the Sabbath is inaugurated over a cup of wine, the text reads, &quot;For you have chosen us and sanctified us out of all the nations, and have given us the Sabbath as an inheritance in love and favour. Praised are you, Lord, who hallows the Sabbath.&quot; In the &quot;Kiddush&quot; recited on festivals it reads, &quot;Blessed are You ... who have chosen us from among all nations, raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments.&quot; The Aleinu prayer refers to the concept of Jews as a chosen people: &quot;It is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth; who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude. We bend the knee and bow and acknowledge before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, that it is he who stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth. His seat of glory is in the heavens above; his abode of majesty is in the lofty heights.

Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah. This view, however, does not always preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God.
Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view: Moses refers to the &quot;God of the spirits of all flesh&quot;, and the Tanakh also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel. Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Natan&#x27;el al-Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, &quot;God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.&quot; The Mishnah states that &quot;Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God&#x27;s greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.&quot; The Tosefta, a collection of important post-Talmudic discourses, also states: &quot;Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come.&quot;

===Further interpretations===
:&quot;The following section contains information from the Jewish Encyclopedia, originally published between 1901–1906, which is in the public domain.&quot;

According to the Rabbis, &quot;Israel is of all nations the most willful or headstrong one, and the Torah was to give it the right scope and power of resistance, or else the world could not have withstood its fierceness.&quot;

&quot;The Lord offered the Law to all nations; but all refused to accept it except Israel.&quot;

How do we understand &quot;A Gentile who consecrates his life to the study and observance of the Law ranks as high as the high priest&quot;, says R. Meïr, by deduction from Lev. xviii. 5; II Sam. vii. 19; Isa. xxvi. 2; Ps. xxxiii. 1, cxviii. 20, cxxv. 4, where all stress is laid not on Israel, but on man or the righteous one.
Maimonides states: &quot;It is now abundantly clear that the pledges Hashem made to Avraham and his descendants would be fulfilled exclusively first in Yitzchak and then in Yaakov, Yitzchak son. This is confirmed by a passage that states, &quot;He is ever mindful of His covenant ... that He made with Avraham, swore to Yitzchak, and confirmed in a decree for Yaakov, for Yisrael, as an eternal covenant.&quot;&quot;

The Gemara states this regarding a non-Jew who studies Torah [his 7 mitzvot] and regarding this, see Shita Mekubetzes, Bava Kama 38a who says that this is an exaggeration. In any case, this statement was not extolling the non-Jew. The Rishonim explain that it is extolling the Torah.

Tosfos explains that it uses the example of a &quot;kohen gadol&quot; (high priest), because this statement is based on the verse, &quot;y&#x27;kara hi mipnimim&quot; (it is more precious than pearls). This is explained elsewhere in the Gemara to mean that the Torah is more precious &quot;pnimim&quot; (translated here as &quot;inside&quot; instead of as &quot;pearls&quot;; thus that the Torah is introspectively absorbed into the person), which refers to &quot;lifnai v&#x27;lifnim&quot; (translated as &quot;the most inner of places&quot;), that is the Holy of Holies where the &quot;kahon gadol&quot; went.

In any case, in Midrash Rabba this statement is made with an important addition: a non-Jew who converts and studies Torah etc.

The Nation of Israel is likened to the olive. Just as this fruit yields its precious oil only after being much pressed and squeezed, so Israel&#x27;s destiny is one of great oppression and hardship, in order that it may thereby give forth its illuminating wisdom. Poverty is the quality most befitting Israel as the chosen people. Only on account of its good works is Israel among the nations &quot;as the lily among thorns&quot;, or &quot;as wheat among the chaff.&quot;

==Modern Orthodox views==
Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain (Modern Orthodox Judaism), described chosenness in this way: &quot;Yes, I do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people—and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual—is &quot;chosen&quot; or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be &#x27;peculiar unto Me&#x27; as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.&quot;

Modern Orthodox theologian Michael Wyschogrod wrote:

&quot;[T]he initial election of Abraham himself was not earned. ... We are simply told that God commanded Abraham to leave his place of birth and go to a land that God would show him. He is also promised that his descendants will become a numerous people. But nowhere does the Bible tell us why Abraham rather than someone else was chosen. The implication is that God chooses whom He wishes and that He owes no accounting to anyone for His choices.&quot;

Rabbi Norman Lamm, a leader of Modern Orthodox Judaism, wrote: &quot;The chosenness of Israel relates exclusively to its spiritual vocation embodied in the Torah; the doctrine, indeed, was announced at Sinai. Whenever it is mentioned in our liturgy—such as the blessing immediately preceding the Shema...it is always related to Torah or Mitzvot (&quot;commandments&quot;). This spiritual vocation consists of two complementary functions, described as &quot;Goy Kadosh&quot;, that of a holy nation, and &quot;Mamlekhet Kohanim&quot;, that of a kingdom of priests. The first term denotes the development of communal separateness or differences in order to achieve a collective self-transcendence. ... The second term implies the obligation of this brotherhood of the spiritual elite toward the rest of mankind; priesthood is defined by the prophets as fundamentally a teaching vocation.&quot;

==Conservative views==

Conservative Judaism views the concept of chosenness in this way: &quot;Few beliefs have been subject to as much misunderstanding as the &#x27;Chosen People&#x27; doctrine. The Torah and the Prophets clearly stated that this does not imply any innate Jewish superiority. In the words of Amos (3:2) &#x27;You alone have I singled out of all the families of the earth—that is why I will call you to account for your iniquities.&#x27; The Torah tells us that we are to be &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; with obligations and duties which flowed from our willingness to accept this status. Far from being a license for special privilege, it entailed additional responsibilities not only toward God but to our fellow human beings. As expressed in the blessing at the reading of the Torah, our people have always felt it to be a privilege to be selected for such a purpose. For the modern traditional Jew, the doctrine of the election and the covenant of Israel offers a purpose for Jewish existence which transcends its own self interests. It suggests that because of our special history and unique heritage we are in a position to demonstrate that a people that takes seriously the idea of being covenanted with God can not only thrive in the face of oppression, but can be a source of blessing to its children and its neighbors. It obligates us to build a just and compassionate society throughout the world and especially in the land of Israel where we may teach by example what it means to be a &#x27;covenant people, a light unto the nations.&#x27;&quot;

Rabbi Reuven Hammer comments on the excised sentence in the Aleinu prayer mentioned above:

&quot;Originally the text read that God has not made us like the nations who &quot;bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an impotent god&quot;, ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends to give the impression that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.&quot;

==Reform views==
Reform Judaism views the concept of chosenness as follows: &quot;Throughout the ages it has been Israel&#x27;s mission to witness to the Divine in the face of every form of paganism and materialism. We regard it as our historic task to cooperate with all men in the establishment of the kingdom of God, of universal brotherhood, Justice, truth and peace on earth. This is our Messianic goal.&quot; In 1999 the Reform movement stated, &quot;We affirm that the Jewish people are bound to God by an eternal covenant, as reflected in our varied understandings of Creation, Revelation and Redemption. ... We are Israel, a people aspiring to holiness, singled out through our ancient covenant and our unique history among the nations to be witnesses to God&#x27;s presence. We are linked by that covenant and that history to all Jews in every age and place.&quot;

==Alternative views==
===Equality of souls===

Many Kabbalistic sources, notably the Tanya, contain statements to the effect that the Jewish soul is qualitatively different from the non-Jewish soul. A number of known Chabad rabbis offered alternative readings of the Tanya, did not take this teaching literally, and even managed to reconcile it with the leftist ideas of internationalism and class struggle. The original text of the Tanya refers to the &quot;idol worshippers&quot; and does not mention the &quot;nations of the world&quot; at all, although such interpretation was endorsed by Menachem Mendel Schneerson and is popular in contemporary Chabad circles. Hillel Paricher, an early Tanya commentator, wrote that the souls of righteous Gentiles are more similar to the Jewish souls, and are generally good and not egoistic. This teaching was accepted by Schneerson and is considered normative in Chabad.

====Different in character but not different in value====
According to the author of the Tanya himself, a righteous non-Jew can achieve a high level of spirituality, similar to an angel, although his soul is still fundamentally different in character, but not value, from a Jewish one. Tzemach Tzedek, the third rebbe of Chabad, wrote that the Muslims are naturally good-hearted people. Rabbi Yosef Jacobson, a popular contemporary Chabad lecturer, teaches that in today&#x27;s world most non-Jews belong to the category of righteous Gentiles, effectively rendering the Tanya&#x27;s attitude anachronistic.

====Altruism====
An anti-Zionist interpretation of Tanya was offered by Abraham Yehudah Khein, a prominent Ukrainian Chabad rabbi, who supported anarchist communism and considered Peter Kropotkin a great Tzaddik. Khein basically read the Tanya backwards; since the souls of idol worshipers are known to be evil, according to the Tanya, while the Jewish souls are known to be good, he concluded that truly altruistic people are really Jewish, in a spiritual sense, while Jewish nationalists and class oppressors are not. By this logic, he claimed that Vladimir Solovyov and Rabindranath Tagore probably have Jewish souls, while Leon Trotsky and other totalitarians do not, and many Zionists, whom he compared to apes, are merely &quot;Jewish by birth certificate&quot;.

====Righteous non-Jews====
Nachman of Breslov also believed that Jewishness is a level of consciousness, and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the Book of Malachi, one can find &quot;potential Jews&quot; among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of &quot;holy faith&quot;, which &quot;activated&quot; the Jewishness in their souls. These people would otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so. Instead, they recognize the Divine unity within their pagan religions.

Isaac Arama, an influential philosopher and mystic of the 15th century, believed that righteous non-Jews are spiritually identical to the righteous Jews. Rabbi Menachem Meiri, a famous Catalan Talmudic commentator and Maimonidian philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, to be part of a greater &quot;spiritual Israel&quot;. He explicitly included Christians and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who had no sense of morality. The only exceptions are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.

Meiri applied his idea of &quot;spiritual Israel&quot; to the Talmudic statements about unique qualities of the Jewish people. For example, he believed that the famous saying that Israel is above astrological predestination (&quot;Ein Mazal le-Israel&quot;) also applied to the followers of other ethical faiths. He also considered countries, inhabited by decent moral non-Jews, such as Languedoc, as a spiritual part of the Holy Land.

===Spinoza===

One Jewish critic of chosenness was the philosopher Baruch Spinoza. In the third chapter of his &quot;Theologico-Political Treatise&quot;, Spinoza mounts an argument against a naive interpretation of God&#x27;s choice of the Jews. Bringing evidence from the Bible itself, he argues that God&#x27;s choice of Israel was not unique (he had chosen other nations before choosing the Hebrew nation) and that the choice of the Jews is neither inclusive (it does not include all of the Jews, but only the &#x27;pious&#x27; ones) nor exclusive (it also includes &#x27;true gentile prophets&#x27;). Finally, he argues that God&#x27;s choice is not unconditional. Recalling the numerous times God threatened the complete destruction of the Hebrew nation, he asserts that this choice is neither absolute, nor eternal, nor necessary.

===Einstein===
In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, the physicist Albert Einstein wrote:
The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people... I cannot see anything “chosen” about them.

==Reconstructionist criticism==
Reconstructionist Judaism rejects the concept of chosenness. Its founder, Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, said that the idea that God chose the Jewish people leads to racist beliefs among Jews, thus, it must be excised from Jewish theology. This rejection of chosenness is made explicit in the movement&#x27;s siddurim (prayer books). For example, the original blessing recited before reading from the Torah contains the phrase, &quot;asher bahar banu mikol ha’amim&quot;—&quot;Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, &quot;who has chosen us from among all peoples&quot; by giving us the Torah.&quot; The Reconstructionist version is rewritten as &quot;asher kervanu la’avodato&quot;, &quot;Praised are you Lord our God, ruler of the Universe, &quot;who has drawn us to your service&quot; by giving us the Torah.&quot; In the mid-1980s, the Reconstructionist movement issued its &quot;Platform on Reconstructionism&quot;. It states that the idea of chosenness is &quot;morally untenable&quot;, because anyone who has such beliefs &quot;implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others.&quot;

Not all Reconstructionists accept this view. The newest siddur of the movement, &quot;Kol Haneshamah&quot;, includes the traditional blessings as an option, and some modern Reconstructionist writers have opined that the traditional formulation should be embraced because it is not racist.

An original prayer book by the Reconstructionist feminist poet Marcia Falk, &quot;The Book of Blessings&quot;, has been accepted by many Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Falk rejects all concepts which are related to hierarchy or distinction; she sees any distinction as leading to the acceptance of other kinds of distinctions, thus leading to prejudice. She writes that as a politically liberal feminist, she must reject distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, Jews and non-Jews, and to some extent even distinctions between the Sabbath and the other six days of the week. She thus rejects the idea of chosenness as unethical. She also rejects Jewish theology in general, and instead holds to a form of religious humanism. Falk writes: &quot;The idea of Israel as God&#x27;s chosen people ... is a key concept in rabbinic Judaism. Yet it is particularly problematic for many Jews today, in that it seems to fly in the face of monotheistic belief that all humanity is created in the divine image—and hence, all humanity is equally loved and valued by God. ... I find it difficult to conceive of a feminist Judaism that would incorporate it in its teaching: the valuing of one people &quot;over and above&quot; others is all too analogous to the privileging of one sex over another.&quot; Reconstructionist author Judith Plaskow also criticises the idea of chosenness, for many of the same reasons as Falk. A politically liberal lesbian, Plaskow rejects most distinctions made between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, and Jews and non-Jews. In contrast to Falk, Plaskow does not reject all concepts of difference as inherently leading to unethical beliefs, and holds to a more classical form of Jewish theism than Falk.

A number of responses to these views have been made by Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold the view that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and such teachings are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain Haredi communities, such as Chabad). A separate criticism stems from the very existence of feminist forms of Judaism in all denominations of Judaism, which do not have a problem with the concept of chosenness.

==Views of other religions==
===Islam===

The children of Israel enjoy a special status in the Islamic holy book, the Quran (2:47 and 2:122). However, Muslim scholars point out that this status did not confer upon Israelites any racial superiority, and was only valid so long as the Israelites maintain their covenant with God.

===Christianity===
Some Christians believe that the Jews were God&#x27;s chosen people, but because of Jewish rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status. This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.

Other Christians, such as the Christadelphians, believe that God has not rejected Israel as his chosen people and that the Jews will in fact accept Jesus as their Messiah at his Second Coming, resulting in their salvation. The view that the Jews still retain their status as the chosen people is also associated with Dispensational theology, promoted by John Nelson Darby and Cyrus Scofield.

Augustine criticized Jewish chosenness as &quot;carnal.&quot; He reasoned that Israel was chosen &quot;according to the flesh.&quot;

The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary similarly argues that God made Israel the &quot;holy nation&quot; to exclusively uphold the promises made to their &quot;pious forefathers&quot;. They argue that Jewish supremacist views are unsound, with Jews being frequently described as a small people that engaged in &quot;perverse&quot; moral conduct in the Bible.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes the &quot;People of God&quot; as referring to all people who have faith in Christ and are baptized. They have characteristics &quot;that distinguish it from all other religious, ethnic, political, or cultural groups found in history&quot;.

==Influence on Judaism&#x27;s relationship with other religions==

Avi Beker, an Israeli scholar and former Secretary General of the World Jewish Congress, regarded the idea of the chosen people as Judaism&#x27;s defining concept and &quot;the central unspoken psychological, historical, and theological problem which is at the heart of Jewish-Gentile relations.&quot; In his book &quot;The Chosen: The History of an Idea, and the Anatomy of an Obsession&quot;, Beker expresses the view that the concept of chosenness is the driving force behind Jewish-Gentile relations, explaining both the admiration and, more pointedly, the envy and the hatred which the world has felt towards the Jews in both religious and secular terms. Beker argues that while Christianity has modified its doctrine on the displacement of the Jews, Islam has neither reversed nor reformed its theology concerning the succession of both the Jews and the Christians. According to Beker, this presents a major barrier to conflict resolution in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

==Ethnocentrism==

The Israeli philosopher Ze&#x27;ev Levy writes that chosenness can be &quot;(partially) justified only from the historical angle&quot; with respect to its spiritual and moral contribution to Jewish life through the centuries as &quot;a powerful agent of consolation and hope&quot;. He points out, however, that modern anthropological theories &quot;do not merely proclaim the inherent universal equality of all people [as] human beings; they also stress the &quot;equivalence&quot; [emphasis in original] of all human cultures.&quot; He continues that &quot;there are no inferior and superior people or cultures but only different, &quot;other&quot;, ones.&quot; He concludes that the concept of chosenness entails ethnocentrism, &quot;which does not go hand in hand with otherness, that is, with unconditional respect of otherness&quot;.

Some people have said that Judaism&#x27;s chosen people concept is racist because it implies that Jews are superior to non-Jews.

<doc id="7455" wikidata="Q842123" url="?curid=7455" title="Chaparral">
<text>Chaparral ( ) is a shrubland plant community found primarily in California, southern Oregon, and northern Baja California. It is shaped by a Mediterranean climate (mild wet winters and hot dry summers) and infrequent, high-intensity crown fires. Many chaparral shrubs have hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft-leaved, drought-deciduous, scrub community of coastal sage scrub, found often on drier, southern-facing slopes.

Three other closely related chaparral shrubland systems occur in southern Arizona, western Texas, and along the eastern side of central Mexico&#x27;s mountain chains, all having summer rains in contrast to the Mediterranean climate of other chaparral formations.

==Etymology==

The name comes from the Spanish word , which translates to &quot;place of the scrub oak&quot;. &quot;Scrub oak&quot; in turn comes from the Basque word , which has the same meaning.

==Overview==
In its natural state, chaparral is characterized by infrequent fires, with natural fire return intervals ranging between 30 years and over 150 years. Mature chaparral (at least 60 years since time of last fire) is characterized by nearly impenetrable, dense thickets (except the more open desert chaparral). These plants are flammable during the late summer and autumn months when conditions are characteristically hot and dry. They grow as woody shrubs with thick, leathery, evergreen and often small leaves. The plants are typically drought resistant, with some exceptions. After the first rains following a fire, the landscape is dominated by small flowering herbaceous plants, known as fire followers, which die back with the summer dry period.

Similar plant communities are found in the four other Mediterranean climate regions around the world, including the Mediterranean Basin (where it is known as ), central Chile (where it is called ), the South African Cape Region (known there as ), and in Western and Southern Australia (as ). According to the California Academy of Sciences, Mediterranean shrubland contains more than 20% of the world&#x27;s plant diversity. Chaparral comprises 9% of California&#x27;s wildland vegetation and contains 20% of its plant species.

Conservation International and other conservation organizations consider chaparral to be a biodiversity hotspot – a biological community with a large number of different species that is threatened by human activity.

Chaparral characteristically is found in areas with steep topography and shallow stony soils, while adjacent areas with clay soils, even where steep, tend to be colonized by annual plants and grasses. Some chaparral species are adapted to nutrient-poor soils developed over serpentine and other ultramafic rock, with a high ratio of magnesium and iron to calcium and potassium, that are also generally low in essential nutrients such as nitrogen.

==California chaparral==

===California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion===

The California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome, has three sub-ecoregions with ecosystem–plant community subdivisions:

===California cismontane and transmontane chaparral subdivisions===
Another phytogeography system uses two California chaparral and woodlands subdivisions: the cismontane chaparral and the transmontane (desert) chaparral.

====California cismontane chaparral====
Cismontane chaparral (&quot;this side of the mountain&quot;) refers to the chaparral ecosystem in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome in California, growing on the western (and coastal) sides of large mountain range systems, such as the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada in the San Joaquin Valley foothills, western slopes of the Peninsular Ranges and California Coast Ranges, and south-southwest slopes of the Transverse Ranges in the Central Coast and Southern California regions.

=====Cismontane chaparral plant species=====
In Central and Southern California chaparral forms a dominant habitat. Members of the chaparral biota native to California, all of which tend to regrow quickly after fires, include:
* &quot;Adenostoma fasciculatum&quot;, chamise
* &quot;Adenostoma sparsifolium&quot;, redshanks
* &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; spp., manzanita
* &quot;Ceanothus&quot; spp., ceanothus
* &quot;Cercocarpus&quot; spp., mountain mahogany
* &quot;Cneoridium dumosum&quot;, bush rue
* &quot;Eriogonum fasciculatum&quot;, California buckwheat

* &quot;Rhus ovata&quot;, sugar bush
* &quot;Salvia apiana&quot;, Californian white sage
* &quot;Salvia mellifera&quot;, Californian black sage
* &quot;Xylococcus bicolor&quot;, mission manzanita

=====Cismontane chaparral bird species=====
The complex ecology of chaparral habitats supports a very large number of animal species. The following is a short list of birds which are an integral part of the cismontane chaparral ecosystems.

:Characteristic chaparral bird species include:
* Wrentit (&quot;Chamaea fasciata&quot;)
* California thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma redivivum&quot;)
* California towhee (&quot;Melozone crissalis&quot;)
* Spotted towhee (&quot;Pipilo maculatus&quot;)
* California scrub jay (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;)

:Other common chaparral bird species include:
* Anna&#x27;s hummingbird (&quot;Calypte anna&quot;)
* Bewick&#x27;s wren (&quot;Thryomanes bewickii&quot;)
* Bushtit (&quot;Psaltriparus minimus&quot;)
* Costa&#x27;s hummingbird (&quot;Calypte costae&quot;)
* Greater roadrunner (&quot;Geococcyx californianus&quot;)

====California transmontane (desert) chaparral====
Transmontane chaparral or desert chaparral—&quot;transmontane&quot; (&quot;the other side of the mountain&quot;) &quot;chaparral&quot;—refers to the desert shrubland habitat and chaparral plant community growing in the rainshadow of these ranges. Transmontane chaparral features xeric desert climate, not Mediterranean climate habitats, and is also referred to as desert chaparral. Desert chaparral is a regional ecosystem subset of the deserts and xeric shrublands biome, with some plant species from the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. Unlike cismontane chaparral, which forms dense, impenetrable stands of plants, desert chaparral is often open, with only about 50% of the ground covered. Individual shrubs can reach up to in height.

Transmontane chaparral or desert chaparral is found on the eastern slopes of major mountain range systems on the western sides of the deserts of California. The mountain systems include the southeastern Transverse Ranges (the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains) in the Mojave Desert north and northeast of the Los Angeles basin and Inland Empire; and the northern Peninsular Ranges (San Jacinto, Santa Rosa, and Laguna Mountains), which separate the Colorado Desert (western Sonoran Desert) from lower coastal Southern California. It is distinguished from the cismontane chaparral found on the coastal side of the mountains, which experiences higher winter rainfall. Naturally, desert chaparral experiences less winter rainfall than cismontane chaparral. Plants in this community are characterized by small, hard (sclerophyllic) evergreen (non-deciduous) leaves. Desert chaparral grows above California&#x27;s desert cactus scrub plant community and below the pinyon–juniper woodland. It is further distinguished from the deciduous sub-alpine scrub above the pinyon–juniper woodlands on the same side of the Peninsular ranges.

Due to the lower annual rainfall (resulting in slower plant growth rates) when compared to cismontane chaparral, desert chaparral is more vulnerable to biodiversity loss and the invasion of non-native weeds and grasses if disturbed by human activity and frequent fire.

=====Transmontane chaparral distribution=====
Transmontane (desert) chaparral typically grows on the lower ( elevation) northern slopes of the southern Transverse Ranges (running east to west in San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties) and on the lower () eastern slopes of the Peninsular Ranges (running south to north from lower Baja California to Riverside and Orange counties and the Transverse Ranges). It can also be found in higher-elevation sky islands in the interior of the deserts, such as in the upper New York Mountains within the Mojave National Preserve in the Mojave Desert.

The California transmontane (desert) chaparral is found in the rain shadow deserts of the following:
* Sierra Nevada creating the Great Basin Desert and northern Mojave Desert
* Transverse Ranges creating the western through eastern Mojave Desert
* Peninsular Ranges creating the Colorado Desert and Yuha Desert.

=====Transmontane chaparral plants=====
* &quot;Adenostoma fasciculatum&quot;, chamise (a low shrub common to most chaparral with clusters of tiny needle like leaves or &quot;fascicles&quot;; similar in appearance to coastal &quot;Eriogonum fasciculatum&quot;)
* &quot;Agave deserti&quot;, desert agave
* &quot;Arctostaphylos glauca&quot;, bigberry manzanita (smooth red bark with large edible berries; glauca means blue-green, the color of its leaves)
* &quot;Ceanothus greggii&quot;, desert ceanothus, California lilac (a nitrogen fixer, has hair on both sides of leaves for heat dissipation)
* &quot;Cercocarpus ledifolius&quot;, curl leaf mountain mahogany, a nitrogen fixer and important food source for desert bighorn sheep
* &quot;Dendromecon rigida&quot;, bush poppy (a fire follower with four petaled yellow flowers)
* &quot;Ephedra&quot; spp., Mormon teas
* &quot;Fremontodendron californicum&quot;, California flannel bush (lobed leaves with fine coating of hair, covered with yellow blossoms in spring)
* &quot;Opuntia acanthocarpa&quot;, buckhorn cholla (branches resemble antlers of a deer)
* &quot;Opuntia echinocarpa&quot;, silver or golden cholla (depending on color of the spines)
* &quot;Opuntia phaeacantha&quot;, desert prickly pear (fruit is important food source for animals)
* &quot;Purshia tridentata&quot;, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush (Rosaceae family)
* &quot;Prunus fremontii&quot;, desert apricot
* &quot;Prunus fasciculata&quot;, desert almond (commonly infested with tent caterpillars of &quot;Malacosoma&quot; spp.)
* &quot;Prunus ilicifolia&quot;, holly-leaf cherry
* &quot;Quercus cornelius-mulleri&quot;, desert scrub oak or Muller&#x27;s oak

==Fire==


Chaparral is a coastal biome with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The chaparral area receives about of precipitation a year. This makes the chaparral most vulnerable to fire in the late summer and fall.

The chaparral ecosystem as a whole is adapted to be able to recover from naturally infrequent, high-intensity fire (fires occurring between 30 and 150 years or more apart); indeed, chaparral regions are known culturally and historically for their impressive fires. (This does create a conflict with human development adjacent to and expanding into chaparral systems.) Additionally, Native Americans burned chaparral near villages on the coastal plain to promote plant species for textiles and food. Before a major fire, typical chaparral plant communities are dominated by manzanita, chamise &quot;Adenostoma fasciculatum&quot; and &quot;Ceanothus&quot; species, toyon (which can sometimes be interspersed with scrub oaks), and other drought-resistant shrubs with hard (sclerophyllous) leaves; these plants resprout (see resprouter) from underground burls after a fire.

Plants that are long-lived in the seed bank or serotinous with induced germination after fire include chamise&quot;, Ceanothus,&quot; and fiddleneck&quot;.&quot; Some chaparral plant communities may grow so dense and tall that it becomes difficult for large animals and humans to penetrate, but may be teeming with smaller fauna in the understory. The seeds of many chaparral plant species are stimulated to germinate by some fire cue (heat or the chemicals from smoke or charred wood). During the time shortly after a fire, chaparral communities may contain soft-leaved herbaceous, fire following annual wildflowers and short-lived perennials that dominate the community for the first few years – until the burl resprouts and seedlings of chaparral shrub species create a mature, dense overstory. Seeds of annuals and shrubs lie dormant until the next fire creates the conditions needed for germination.

Several shrub species such as &quot;Ceanothus&quot; fix nitrogen, increasing the availability of nitrogen compounds in the soil.

Because of the hot, dry conditions that exist in the California summer and fall, chaparral is one of the most fire-prone plant communities in North America. Some fires are caused by lightning, but these are usually during periods of high humidity and low winds and are easily controlled. Nearly all of the very large wildfires are caused by human activity during periods of hot, dry easterly Santa Ana winds. These human-caused fires are commonly ignited by power line failures, vehicle fires and collisions, sparks from machinery, arson, or campfires.

===Threatened by high fire frequency===
Though adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be eliminated by frequent fires. A high frequency of fire (less than 10-15 years apart) will result in the loss of obligate seeding shrub species such as &quot;Manzanita&quot; spp. This high frequency disallows seeder plants to reach their reproductive size before the next fire and the community shifts to a sprouter-dominance. If high frequency fires continue over time, obligate resprouting shrub species can also be eliminated by exhausting their energy reserves below-ground. Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to non-native annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under drought brought about by climate change.

===Wildfire debate===
There are two older hypotheses relating to California chaparral fire regimes that caused considerable debate in the past within the fields of wildfire ecology and land management. Research over the past two decades have rejected these hypotheses:
# That older stands of chaparral become &quot;senescent&quot; or &quot;decadent&quot;, thus implying that fire is necessary for the plants to remain healthy,
# That wildfire suppression policies have allowed dead chaparral to accumulate unnaturally, creating ample fuel for large fires.

The perspective that older chaparral is unhealthy or unproductive may have originated during the 1940s when studies were conducted measuring the amount of forage available to deer populations in chaparral stands. However, according to recent studies, California chaparral is extraordinarily resilient to very long periods without fire and continues to maintain productive growth throughout pre-fire conditions. Seeds of many chaparral plants actually require 30 years or more worth of accumulated leaf litter before they will successfully germinate (e.g., scrub oak, &quot;Quercus berberidifolia&quot;; toyon, &quot;Heteromeles arbutifolia&quot;; and holly-leafed cherry, &quot;Prunus ilicifolia&quot;). When intervals between fires drop below 10 to 15 years, many chaparral species are eliminated and the system is typically replaced by non-native, invasive, weedy grassland.

The idea that older chaparral is responsible for causing large fires was originally proposed in the 1980s by comparing wildfires in Baja California and southern California. It was suggested that fire suppression activities in southern California allowed more fuel to accumulate, which in turn led to larger fires. This is similar to the observation that fire suppression and other human-caused disturbances in dry, ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest of the United States has unnaturally increased forest density. Historically, mixed-severity fires likely burned through these forests every decade or so, burning understory plants, small trees, and downed logs at low-severity, and patches of trees at high-severity. However, chaparral has a high-intensity crown-fire regime, meaning that fires consume nearly all the above ground growth whenever they burn, with a historical frequency of 30 to 150 years or more. A detailed analysis of historical fire data concluded that fire suppression activities have been ineffective at excluding fire from southern California chaparral, unlike in ponderosa pine forests. In addition, the number of fires is increasing in step with population growth and exacerbated by climate change. Chaparral stand age does not have a significant correlation to its tendency to burn.

Large, infrequent, high-intensity wildfires are part of the natural fire regime for California chaparral. Extreme weather conditions (low humidity, high temperature, high winds), drought, and low fuel moisture are the primary factors in determining how large a chaparral fire becomes.

<doc id="7461" wikidata="Q273081" url="?curid=7461" title="Clipper">
<text>A clipper was a type of mid-19th-century merchant sailing vessel, designed for speed. The term was also retrospectively applied to the Baltimore clipper, which originated in the late 18th century.

Clippers were generally narrow for their length, small by later 19th-century standards, could carry limited bulk freight, and had a large total sail area. &quot;Clipper&quot; does not refer to a specific sailplan; clippers may be schooners, brigs, brigantines, etc., as well as full-rigged ships. Clippers were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, although France, Brazil, the Netherlands, and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and China, in transatlantic trade, and on the New York-to-San Francisco route around Cape Horn during the California gold rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java.

The boom years of the clipper era began in 1843 in response to a growing demand for faster delivery of tea from China and continued with the demand for swift passage to gold fields in California and Australia beginning in 1848 and 1851, respectively. The era ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

==Origin and usage of &quot;clipper&quot;==
The etymological origin of the word clipper is uncertain, but is believed to be derived from the English language verb &quot;to clip&quot;, which at the time meant &quot;to run or fly swiftly&quot;.

The first application of the term &quot;clipper&quot;, in a nautical sense, is likewise uncertain. The type known as the Baltimore clipper originated at the end of the 18th century on the eastern seaboard of the USA. At first, these fast sailing vessels were referred to as &quot;Virginia-built&quot; or &quot;pilot-boat model&quot;, with the name &quot;Baltimore-built&quot; appearing during the War of 1812. In the final days of the slave trade (&quot;circa&quot; 1835–1850)just as the type was dying outthe term, Baltimore clipper, became common. The common retrospective application of the word &quot;clipper&quot; to this type of vessel has caused confusion.

The Oxford English Dictionary&#x27;s earliest quote (referring to the Baltimore clipper) is from 1824. The dictionary cites Royal Navy officer and novelist Frederick Marryat as using the term in 1830. British newspaper usage of the term can be found as early as 1832 and in shipping advertisements from 1835. A US court case of 1834 has evidence that discusses a clipper being faster than a brig.

==Definitions==

A clipper is a sailing vessel designed for speed, a priority that takes precedence over cargo-carrying capacity or building or operating costs. It is not restricted to any one rig (while many were fully rigged ships, others were barques, brigs, or schooners), nor was the term restricted to any one hull type. Howard Chapelle lists three basic hull types for clippers. The first was characterised by the sharp and ends found in the Baltimore clipper. The second was a hull with a full midsection and modest deadrise, but sharp endsthis was a development of the hull form of transatlantic packets. The third was more experimental, with deadrise and sharpness being balanced against the need to carry a profitable quantity of cargo. A clipper carried a large sail area and a fast hull; by the standards of any other type of sailing ship, a clipper was greatly over-canvassed. The last defining feature of a clipper, in the view of maritime historian David MacGregor, was a captain who had the courage, skill, and determination to get the fastest speed possible out of her.

In assessing the hull of a clipper, different maritime historians use different criteria to measure &quot;sharpness&quot;, &quot;fine lines&quot; or &quot;fineness&quot;, a concept which is explained by comparing a rectangular cuboid with the underwater shape of a vessel&#x27;s hull. The more material one has to carve off the cuboid to achieve the hull shape, the sharper the hull. Ideally, a maritime historian would be able to look at either the block coefficient of fineness or the prismatic coefficient of various clippers, but measured drawings or accurate half models may not exist to calculate either of these figures. An alternative measure of sharpness for hulls of a broadly similar shape is the coefficient of underdeck tonnage, as used by David MacGregor in comparing tea clippers. This could be calculated from the measurements taken to determine the registered tonnage, so can be applied to more vessels.

An extreme clipper has a hull of great fineness, as judged either by the prismatic coefficient, the coefficient of underdeck tonnage, or some other technical assessment of hull shape. This term has been misapplied in the past, without reference to hull shape. As commercial vessels, these are totally reliant on speed to generate a profit for their owners, as their sharpness limits their cargo-carrying capacity.

A medium clipper has a cargo-carrying hull that has some sharpness. In the right conditions and with a capable captain, some of these achieved notable quick passages. They were also able to pay their way when the high freight rates often paid to a fast sailing ship were not available (in a fluctuating market).

The term &quot;clipper&quot; applied to vessels between these two categories. They often made passages as fast as extreme clippers, but had less difficulty in making a living when freight rates were lower.

==History==

The first ships to which the term &quot;clipper&quot; seems to have been applied were the Baltimore clippers, developed in the Chesapeake Bay before the American Revolution, and reached their zenith between 1795 and 1815. They were small, rarely exceeding 200 tons OM. Their hulls were sharp ended and displayed much deadrise. They were rigged as schooners, brigs, or brigantines.
In the War of 1812, some were lightly armed, sailing under letters of marque and reprisal, when the typeexemplified by &quot;Chasseur&quot;, launched at Fells Point, Baltimore in 1814became known for her incredible speed; the deep draft enabled the Baltimore clipper to sail close to the wind. Clippers, running the British blockade of Baltimore, came to be recognized for speed rather than cargo space.

The type existed as early as 1780. A 1789 drawing of purchased by the Royal Navy in 1780 in the West Indiesrepresents the earliest draught of what became known as the Baltimore clipper.

Vessels of the Baltimore clipper type continued to be built for the slave trade, being useful for escaping enforcement of the British and American legislation prohibiting the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Some of these Baltimore clippers were captured when working as slavers, condemned by the appropriate court, and sold to owners who then used them as opium clippersmoving from one illegal international trade to another.

&quot;Ann McKim&quot;, built in Baltimore in 1833 by the Kennard &amp; Williamson shipyard, is considered by some to be the original clipper ship. (Maritime historians Howard I. Chapelle and David MacGregor decry the concept of the &quot;first&quot; clipper, preferring a more evolutionary, multiple-step development of the type.) She measured 494 tons OM, and was built on the enlarged lines of a Baltimore clipper, with sharply raked stem, counter stern, and square rig. Although &quot;Ann McKim&quot; was the first large clipper ship ever constructed, she cannot be said to have founded the clipper ship era, or even that she directly influenced shipbuilders, since no other ship was built like her, but she may have suggested the clipper design in vessels of ship rig. She did, however, influence the building of &quot;Rainbow&quot; in 1845, the first extreme clipper ship.

In Aberdeen, Scotland, shipbuilders Alexander Hall and Sons developed the &quot;Aberdeen&quot; clipper bow in the late 1830s; the first was &quot;Scottish Maid&quot; launched in 1839. &quot;Scottish Maid&quot;, 150 tons OM, was the first British clipper ship. &quot;&quot;Scottish Maid&quot; was intended for the Aberdeen-London trade, where speed was crucial to compete with steamships. The Hall brothers tested various hulls in a water tank and found the clipper design most effective. The design was influenced by tonnage regulations. Tonnage measured a ship&#x27;s cargo capacity and was used to calculate tax and harbour dues. The new 1836 regulations measured depth and breadth with length measured at half midship depth. Extra length above this level was tax-free and became a feature of clippers. &quot;Scottish Maid&quot; proved swift and reliable and the design was widely copied.&quot; The earliest British clipper ships were built for trade within the British Isles (&quot;Scottish Maid&quot; was built for the Aberdeen to London trade). Then followed the vast clipper trade of tea, opium, spices, and other goods from the Far East to Europe, and the ships became known as &quot;tea clippers&quot;.

From 1839, larger American clipper ships started to be built beginning with &quot;Akbar&quot;, 650 tons OM, in 1839, and including the 1844-built &quot;Houqua&quot;, 581 tons OM. These larger vessels were built predominantly for use in the China tea trade and known as &quot;tea clippers&quot;.
Then in 1845 &quot;Rainbow&quot;, 757 tons OM, the first extreme clipper, was launched in New York. These American clippers were larger vessels designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. Extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855.

In 1851, shipbuilders in Medford, Massachusetts, built what is sometimes called one of the first medium clippers, the &quot;Antelope&quot;, often called the &quot;Antelope of Boston&quot; to distinguish her from other ships of the same name. A contemporary ship-design journalist noted that &quot;the design of her model was to combine large stowage capacity with good sailing qualities.&quot; &quot;Antelope&quot; was relatively flat-floored and had only an 8-inch deadrise at half-floor.

The medium clipper, though still very fast, could carry more cargo. After 1854, extreme clippers were replaced in American shipbuilding yards by medium clippers.
The &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; was a clipper ship built in 1851 that established the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco within weeks of her launching, then broke her own records three years later, which stood at 89 days 8 hours until 1989. (The other contender for this &quot;blue ribbon&quot; title was the medium clipper &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;an unresolvable argument exists over timing these voyages &quot;from pilot to pilot&quot;). &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; was the most famous of the clippers built by Donald McKay. She was known for her extremely close race with the &quot;Hornet&quot; in 1853; for having a woman navigator, Eleanor Creesy, wife of Josiah Perkins Creesy, who skippered the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; on two record-setting voyages from New York to San Francisco; and for sailing in the Australia and timber trades.

Clipper ships largely ceased being built in American shipyards in 1859 when, unlike the earlier boom years, only four clipper ships were built; a few were built in the 1860s. 
British clipper ships continued to be built after 1859. From 1859, a new design was developed for British clipper ships that was nothing like the American clippers; these ships continued to be called extreme clippers. The new design had a sleek, graceful appearance, less sheer, less freeboard, lower bulwarks, and smaller breadth. They were built for the China tea trade, starting with &quot;Falcon&quot; in 1859, and continuing until 1870. The earlier ships were made from wood, though some were made from iron, just as some British clippers had been made from iron prior to 1859. In 1863, the first tea clippers of composite construction were brought out, combining the best of both worlds. Composite clippers had the strength of an iron hull framework but with wooden planking that, with properly insulated fastenings, could use copper sheathing without the problem of galvanic corrosion. Copper sheathing prevented fouling and teredo worm, but could not be used on iron hulls. The iron framework of composite clippers was less bulky and lighter, so allowing more cargo in a hull of the same external shape.

After 1869, with the opening of the Suez Canal that greatly advantaged steam vessels (see Decline below), the tea trade collapsed for clippers. From the late 1860s until the early 1870s, the clipper trade increasingly focused on the Britain to Australia and New Zealand route, carrying goods and immigrants, services that had begun earlier with the Australian Gold Rush of the 1850s. British-built clipper ships and many American-built, British-owned ships were used. Even in the 1880s, sailing ships were still the main carriers of cargo between Britain, and Australia and New Zealand. This trade eventually became unprofitable, and the ageing clipper fleet became unseaworthy.
=== Opium clippers ===
Before the early 18th century, the East India Company paid for its tea mainly in silver. When the Chinese emperor chose to embargo European-manufactured commodities and demand payment for all Chinese goods in silver, the price rose, restricting trade. The East India Company began to produce opium in India, something desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British. This had to be smuggled into China on smaller, fast-sailing ships, called &quot;opium clippers&quot;. Some of these were built specifically for the purposemostly in India and Britain, such as the 1842-built &quot;Ariel&quot;, 100 tons OM. Some fruit schooners were bought for this trade, as were some Baltimore clippers.

== China clippers and the apogee of sail ==

Among the most notable clippers were the China clippers, also called tea clippers, designed to ply the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies. The last example of these still in reasonable condition is &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, preserved in dry dock at Greenwich, United Kingdom. Damaged by fire on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation, the ship was permanently elevated 3.0 m above the dry dock floor in 2010 as part of a plan for long-term preservation.

Clippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. One passenger ship survives, the &quot;City of Adelaide&quot; designed by William Pile of Sunderland. The fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as tea, opium, spices, people, and mail. The return could be spectacular. The &quot;Challenger&quot; returned from Shanghai with &quot;the most valuable cargo of tea and silk ever to be laden in one bottom&quot;. Competition among the clippers was public and fierce, with their times recorded in the newspapers.

The last China clippers had peak speeds over , but their average speeds over a whole voyage were substantially less. The joint winner of the Great Tea Race of 1866 logged about 15,800 nautical miles on a 99-day trip. This gives an average speed slightly over . The key to a fast passage for a tea clipper was getting across the China Sea against the monsoon winds that prevailed when the first tea crop of the season was ready. These difficult sailing conditions (light and/or contrary winds) dictated the design of tea clippers. The US clippers were designed for the strong winds encountered on their route around Cape Horn.

Donald McKay&#x27;s &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; reported the highest speed ever achieved by a sailing ship of the era, , made while running her easting down to Australia in 1854. (John Griffiths&#x27; first clipper, the &quot;Rainbow&quot;, had a top speed of 14 knots.) Eleven other instances are reported of a ship&#x27;s logging or over. Ten of these were recorded by American clippers.
Besides the breath-taking day&#x27;s run of the &quot;Champion of the Seas&quot;, 13 other cases are known of a ship&#x27;s sailing over in 24 hours.
With few exceptions, though, all the port-to-port sailing records are held by the American clippers.
The 24-hour record of the &quot;Champion of the Seas&quot;, set in 1854, was not broken until 1984 (by a multihull), or 2001 (by another monohull).

==Decline==

The American clippers sailing from the East Coast to the California goldfields were working in a booming market. Freight rates were high everywhere in the first years of the 1850s. This started to fade in late 1853. The ports of California and Australia reported that they were overstocked with goods that had been shipped earlier in the year. This gave an accelerating fall in freight rates that was halted, however, by the start of the Crimean War in March 1854, as many ships were now being chartered by the French and British governments. The end of the Crimean War in April 1856 released all this capacity back on the world shipping marketsthe result being a severe slump. The next year had the Panic of 1857, with effects on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States was just starting to recover from this in 1861 when the American Civil War started, causing significant disruption to trade in both Union and Confederate states.
As the economic situation deteriorated in 1853, American shipowners either did not order new vessels, or specified an ordinary clipper or a medium clipper instead of an extreme clipper. No extreme clipper was launched in an American shipyard after the end of 1854 and only a few medium clippers after 1860.

By contrast, British trade recovered well at the end of the 1850s. Tea clippers had continued to be launched during the depressed years, apparently little affected by the economic downturn. The long-distance route to China was not realistically challenged by steamships in the early part of the 1860s. No true steamer (as opposed to an auxiliary steamship) had the fuel efficiency to carry sufficient cargo to make a profitable voyage. The auxiliary steamships struggled to make any profit.
The situation changed in 1866 when the Alfred Holt-designed and owned SS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; made her first voyage to China. Holt had persuaded the Board of Trade to allow higher steam pressures in British merchant vessels. Running at 60 psi instead of the previously permitted 25 psi, and using an efficient compound engine, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; had the fuel efficiency to steam at 10 knots to China and back, with coaling stops at Mauritius on the outward and return legscrucially carrying sufficient cargo to make a profit.

In 1869, the Suez Canal opened, giving steamships a route about shorter than that taken by sailing ships round the Cape of Good Hope. Despite initial conservatism by tea merchants, by 1871, tea clippers found strong competition from steamers in the tea ports of China. A typical passage time back to London for a steamer was 58 days, while the fastest clippers could occasionally make the trip in less than 100 days; the average was 123 days in the 1867–68 tea season. The freight rate for a steamer in 1871 was roughly double that paid to a sailing vessel. Some clipper owners were severely caught out by this; several extreme clippers had been launched in 1869, including &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, &quot;Norman Court&quot; and &quot;Caliph&quot;.

== Surviving ships ==
Of the many clipper ships built during the mid-19th century, only two are known to survive. The only intact survivor is &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, which was preserved as a museum ship in 1954 at Greenwich for public display. The other known survivor is &quot;City of Adelaide&quot;; unlike &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, she was reduced to a hulk over the years. She eventually sank at her moorings in 1991, but was raised the following year, and remained on dry land for years. &quot;Adelaide&quot; (or S.V. &quot;Carrick&quot;) is the older of the two survivors, and was transported to Australia for conservation.

==In popular culture==
The clipper legacy appears in collectible cards and in the name of a basketball team.

=== Sailing cards ===
Departures of clipper ships, mostly from New York and Boston to San Francisco, were advertised by clipper-ship sailing cards. These cards, slightly larger than today&#x27;s postcards, were produced by letterpress and wood engraving on coated card stock. Most clipper cards were printed in the 1850s and 1860s, and represented the first pronounced use of color in American advertising art. Perhaps 3,500 cards survive. With their rarity and importance as artifacts of nautical, Western, and printing history, clipper cards are valued by both private collectors and institutions.

=== Basketball team ===
The Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association take their name from the type of ship. After the Buffalo Braves moved to San Diego, California in 1978, a contest was held to choose a new name. The winning name highlighted the city&#x27;s connection with the clippers that frequented San Diego Bay. The team retained the name in its 1984 move to Los Angeles.

=== Airliners ===
The airline Pan Am named its aircraft beginning with the word &#x27;Clipper&#x27; and used Clipper as its callsign. This was intended to evoke an image of speed and glamour.

<doc id="7462" wikidata="Q2979423" url="?curid=7462" title="Clive Anderson">
<text>Clive Stuart Anderson (born 10 December 1952) is an English television and radio presenter, comedian, writer and former barrister. Winner of a British Comedy Award in 1991, Anderson began experimenting with comedy and writing comedic scripts during his 15-year legal career. He then became host of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, initially a radio show on BBC Radio 4 in 1988, before moving to television on Channel 4 from 1988 to 1999. He was also host of his own chat show &quot;Clive Anderson Talks Back&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Clive Anderson All Talk&quot; in 1996, from 1989 to 1999. He has also hosted many radio programmes and made guest appearances on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;.

== Early life ==
Anderson&#x27;s mother was English and his parents met while serving in the RAF. He was educated at Stanburn Primary School and Harrow County School for Boys then a grammar school which closed in 1975. His group of contemporaries included Geoffrey Perkins and Michael Portillo. His Scottish father originally from Glasgow was promoted to manager of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, Wembley branch. Anderson attended Selwyn College, Cambridge, where, from 1974 to 1975, he was President of the Cambridge Footlights. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1976 and became a practising barrister, specialising in criminal law. While still practising law, he continued performing, including taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe in 1981 with Griff Rhys Jones.

==Career==

===Television===
Anderson was involved in the fledgling alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s and was the first act to appear at The Comedy Store when it opened in 1979. He made his name as host of the original UK version of the improvised television comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, which ran for 10 series on Channel 4 from 1988 to 1999.

Anderson hosted his own chat show &quot;Clive Anderson Talks Back&quot;, which ran for 10 series on Channel 4 from 1989 to 1996. The show then moved to the BBC, with the name changed to &quot;Clive Anderson All Talk&quot;, running for 4 series from 1996 to 1999. In one incident in 1997, Anderson was deserted by his guests, the Bee Gees, after he made several digs at them and their music. He once had a glass of water poured over his head by a perturbed Richard Branson, to which he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m used to that; I&#x27;ve flown Virgin.&quot; When singer and actress Cher appeared on the show, Anderson alluded to her alleged cosmetic surgery, asking her &quot;You look like a million dollars – is that how much it cost?&quot; He also said to author and politician Jeffrey Archer, in response to his derogatory comment about the show, &quot;You&#x27;re a critic too... there&#x27;s no beginning to your talents.&quot; Archer retorted that &quot;The old ones are always the best&quot; for Anderson to reply &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ve read your books.&quot;

He has made ten appearances on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. In 1996, a heated exchange occurred on the show when he joked to fellow guest Piers Morgan that the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was now, thanks to Morgan (then its editor), almost as good as &quot;The Sun&quot;. When asked by Morgan, &quot;What do you know about editing newspapers?&quot; he swiftly replied &quot;About as much as you do&quot;. Anderson has also frequently appeared on &quot;QI&quot;. In 2007, he featured as a regular panellist on the ITV comedy show &quot;News Knight&quot;. From 2019 to 2020 he co-hosted the television series &quot;Mystic Britain&quot; on the Sky television channel Smithsonian. 

In 2005, he presented the short-lived quiz &quot;Back in the Day&quot; for Channel 4. On 25 February 2008, he started to present &quot;Brainbox Challenge&quot;, a new game show, for BBC Two. Later that year, he presented a talent show-themed reality TV series produced by the BBC entitled &quot;Maestro&quot;, starring eight celebrities. In 2009, Anderson was the television host of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Night of the Proms&quot;.

In November 2023, Anderson appeared on TV game show &quot;Richard Osman&#x27;s House of Games&quot;, winning the show by one point.

===Radio===
Anderson presents legal show &quot;Unreliable Evidence&quot; on BBC Radio 4. He also covered the Sunday morning 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. show on BBC Radio 2 until the end of January 2008.

In early 1988, Anderson hosted the original radio version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, which ran for 6 episodes on BBC Radio 4 before the show moved to television later that year.

It was announced in April 2008 that Anderson, who had previously filled in for host Ned Sherrin from 2006 until Sherrin&#x27;s death in 2007, would be taking over as permanent host of &quot;Loose Ends&quot;. He also hosted six series of &quot;Clive Anderson&#x27;s Chat Room&quot; on BBC Radio 2 from 2004 to 2009. Anderson has appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; hosted by David Mitchell.

Anderson also presented the radio show &quot;The Guessing Game&quot; on BBC Radio Scotland. Anderson has also appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;.

===Comedy and newspaper writing===
Anderson is a comedy sketch writer who has written for Frankie Howerd, &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, and Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith. One of his early comedy writing projects was &quot;Black Cinderella Two Goes East&quot; with Rory McGrath for BBC Radio 4 in 1978. As well as writing comedy, Anderson is also a frequent contributor to newspapers and was a regular columnist for &quot;The Sunday Correspondent&quot;.

==Personal life==
Anderson lives in Highbury, north London, with his consultant wife, Jane Anderson, a physician who has spent her career in managing HIV/AIDS. The couple have three children.

He supports Arsenal, and Rangers football teams. He is President of the Woodland Trust and became Vice Patron of the Solicitors&#x27; Benevolent Association, a registered charity.

==Awards==
The show &quot;Whose Line is it Anyway?&quot; won a BAFTA award in 1990. Later, Anderson won both the &quot;Top Entertainment Presenter&quot; and &quot;Top Radio Comedy Personality&quot; at the British Comedy Awards in 1991. In 2023 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.

<doc id="7463" wikidata="Q180381" url="?curid=7463" title="Cold fusion">
<text>Cold fusion is a hypothesized type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature. It would contrast starkly with the &quot;hot&quot; fusion that is known to take place naturally within stars and artificially in hydrogen bombs and prototype fusion reactors under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees, and be distinguished from muon-catalyzed fusion. There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur.

In 1989, two electrochemists at the University of Utah, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat (&quot;excess heat&quot;) of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including neutrons and tritium. The small tabletop experiment involved electrolysis of heavy water on the surface of a palladium (Pd) electrode. The reported results received wide media attention and raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy.

Many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available. Expectations diminished as a result of numerous failed replications, the retraction of several previously reported positive replications, the identification of methodological flaws and experimental errors in the original study, and, ultimately, the confirmation that Fleischmann and Pons had not observed the expected nuclear reaction byproducts. By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead, and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science. In 1989 the United States Department of Energy (DOE) concluded that the reported results of excess heat did not present convincing evidence of a useful source of energy and decided against allocating funding specifically for cold fusion. A second DOE review in 2004, which looked at new research, reached similar conclusions and did not result in DOE funding of cold fusion. Presently, since articles about cold fusion are rarely published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals, they do not attract the level of scrutiny expected for mainstream scientific publications.

Nevertheless, some interest in cold fusion has continued through the decades—for example, a Google-funded failed replication attempt was published in a 2019 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;. A small community of researchers continues to investigate it, often under the alternative designations &quot;low-energy nuclear reactions&quot; (&quot;LENR&quot;) or &quot;condensed matter nuclear science&quot; (&quot;CMNS&quot;).

==History==
Nuclear fusion is normally understood to occur at temperatures in the tens of millions of degrees. This is called &quot;thermonuclear fusion&quot;. Since the 1920s, there has been speculation that nuclear fusion might be possible at much lower temperatures by catalytically fusing hydrogen absorbed in a metal catalyst. In 1989, a claim by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann (then one of the world&#x27;s leading electrochemists) that such cold fusion had been observed caused a brief media sensation before the majority of scientists criticized their claim as incorrect after many found they could not replicate the excess heat. Since the initial announcement, cold fusion research has continued by a small community of researchers who believe that such reactions happen and hope to gain wider recognition for their experimental evidence.

===Early research===
The ability of palladium to absorb hydrogen was recognized as early as the nineteenth century by Thomas Graham. In the late 1920s, two Austrian-born scientists, Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters, originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature. However, the authors later retracted that report, saying that the helium they measured was due to background from the air.

In 1927, Swedish scientist John Tandberg reported that he had fused hydrogen into helium in an electrolytic cell with palladium electrodes. On the basis of his work, he applied for a Swedish patent for &quot;a method to produce helium and useful reaction energy&quot;. Due to Paneth and Peters&#x27;s retraction and his inability to explain the physical process, his patent application was denied. After deuterium was discovered in 1932, Tandberg continued his experiments with heavy water. The final experiments made by Tandberg with heavy water were similar to the original experiment by Fleischmann and Pons. Fleischmann and Pons were not aware of Tandberg&#x27;s work.

The term &quot;cold fusion&quot; was used as early as 1956 in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Luis Alvarez&#x27;s work on muon-catalyzed fusion. Paul Palmer and then Steven Jones of Brigham Young University used the term &quot;cold fusion&quot; in 1986 in an investigation of &quot;geo-fusion&quot;, the possible existence of fusion involving hydrogen isotopes in a planetary core. In his original paper on this subject with Clinton Van Siclen, submitted in 1985, Jones had coined the term &quot;piezonuclear fusion&quot;.

===Fleischmann–Pons experiment===
The most famous cold fusion claims were made by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann in 1989. After a brief period of interest by the wider scientific community, their reports were called into question by nuclear physicists. Pons and Fleischmann never retracted their claims, but moved their research program from the US to France after the controversy erupted.

====Events preceding announcement====

Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30 °C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50 °C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.

In 1988, Fleischmann and Pons applied to the United States Department of Energy for funding towards a larger series of experiments. Up to this point they had been funding their experiments using a small device built with $100,000 out-of-pocket. The grant proposal was turned over for peer review, and one of the reviewers was Steven Jones of Brigham Young University. Jones had worked for some time on muon-catalyzed fusion, a known method of inducing nuclear fusion without high temperatures, and had written an article on the topic entitled &quot;Cold nuclear fusion&quot; that had been published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in July 1987. Fleischmann and Pons and co-workers met with Jones and co-workers on occasion in Utah to share research and techniques. During this time, Fleischmann and Pons described their experiments as generating considerable &quot;excess energy&quot;, in the sense that it could not be explained by chemical reactions alone. They felt that such a discovery could bear significant commercial value and would be entitled to patent protection. Jones, however, was measuring neutron flux, which was not of commercial interest. To avoid future problems, the teams appeared to agree to publish their results simultaneously, though their accounts of their 6 March meeting differ.

====Announcement====
In mid-March 1989, both research teams were ready to publish their findings, and Fleischmann and Jones had agreed to meet at an airport on 24 March to send their papers to &quot;Nature&quot; via FedEx. Fleischmann and Pons, however, pressured by the University of Utah, which wanted to establish priority on the discovery, broke their apparent agreement, disclosing their work at a press conference on 23 March (they claimed in the press release that it would be published in &quot;Nature&quot; but instead submitted their paper to the &quot;Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry&quot;). Jones, upset, faxed in his paper to &quot;Nature&quot; after the press conference.

Fleischmann and Pons&#x27; announcement drew wide media attention, as well as attention from the scientific community. The 1986 discovery of high-temperature superconductivity had made scientists more open to revelations of unexpected but potentially momentous scientific results that could be replicated reliably even if they could not be explained by established theories. Many scientists were also reminded of the Mössbauer effect, a process involving nuclear transitions in a solid. Its discovery 30 years earlier had also been unexpected, though it was quickly replicated and explained within the existing physics framework.

The announcement of a new purported clean source of energy came at a crucial time: adults still remembered the 1973 oil crisis and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropogenic global warming was starting to become notorious, the anti-nuclear movement was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of strip mining, acid rain, the greenhouse effect and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which happened the day after the announcement. In the press conference, Chase N. Peterson, Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve environmental problems, and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy, using only seawater as fuel. They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them. In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: &quot;What we have done is to open the door of a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics.&quot;

====Response and fallout====
Although the experimental protocol had not been published, physicists in several countries attempted, and failed, to replicate the excess heat phenomenon. The first paper submitted to &quot;Nature&quot; reproducing excess heat, although it passed peer review, was rejected because most similar experiments were negative and there were no theories that could explain a positive result; this paper was later accepted for publication by the journal &quot;Fusion Technology&quot;.

Nathan Lewis, professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, led one of the most ambitious validation efforts, trying many variations on the experiment without success, while CERN physicist Douglas R. O. Morrison said that &quot;essentially all&quot; attempts in Western Europe had failed. Even those reporting success had difficulty reproducing Fleischmann and Pons&#x27; results. On 10 April 1989, a group at Texas A&amp;M University published results of excess heat and later that day a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology announced neutron production—the strongest replication announced up to that point due to the detection of neutrons and the reputation of the lab. On 12 April Pons was acclaimed at an ACS meeting. But Georgia Tech retracted their announcement on 13 April, explaining that their neutron detectors gave false positives when exposed to heat.

Another attempt at independent replication, headed by Robert Huggins at Stanford University, which also reported early success with a light water control, became the only scientific support for cold fusion in 26 April US Congress hearings. But when he finally presented his results he reported an excess heat of only one degree Celsius, a result that could be explained by chemical differences between heavy and light water in the presence of lithium. He had not tried to measure any radiation and his research was derided by scientists who saw it later. For the next six weeks, competing claims, counterclaims, and suggested explanations kept what was referred to as &quot;cold fusion&quot; or &quot;fusion confusion&quot; in the news.

In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons published a &quot;preliminary note&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry&quot;. This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding Compton edge, which indicated they had made a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts. Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique, but the only thing left clear was that no gamma ray had been registered and that Fleischmann refused to recognize any mistakes in the data. A much longer paper published a year later went into details of calorimetry but did not include any nuclear measurements.

Nevertheless, Fleischmann and Pons and a number of other researchers who found positive results remained convinced of their findings. The University of Utah asked Congress to provide $25 million to pursue the research, and Pons was scheduled to meet with representatives of President Bush in early May.

On 30 April 1989, cold fusion was declared dead by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; called it a circus the same day, and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; attacked cold fusion the following day.

On 1 May 1989, the American Physical Society held a session on cold fusion in Baltimore, including many reports of experiments that failed to produce evidence of cold fusion. At the end of the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated that they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons claim dead, with the ninth, Johann Rafelski, abstaining. Steven E. Koonin of Caltech called the Utah report a result of &quot;the incompetence and delusion of Pons and Fleischmann,&quot; which was met with a standing ovation. Douglas R. O. Morrison, a physicist representing CERN, was the first to call the episode an example of pathological science. On 4 May, due to all this new criticism, the meetings with various representatives from Washington were cancelled.

From 8 May, only the A&amp;M tritium results kept cold fusion afloat.

In July and November 1989, &quot;Nature&quot; published papers critical of cold fusion claims. Negative results were also published in several other scientific journals including &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, and &quot;Physical Review C&quot; (nuclear physics). In August 1989, in spite of this trend, the state of Utah invested $4.5 million to create the National Cold Fusion Institute.

The United States Department of Energy organized a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research. The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy would result from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion. The panel noted the large number of failures to replicate excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts expected by established conjecture. Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and, if verified, would require established conjecture, perhaps even theory itself, to be extended in an unexpected way. The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of &quot;focused experiments within the general funding system&quot;.

Cold fusion supporters continued to argue that the evidence for excess heat was strong, and in September 1990 the National Cold Fusion Institute listed 92 groups of researchers from 10 countries that had reported corroborating evidence of excess heat, but they refused to provide any evidence of their own arguing that it could endanger their patents. However, no further DOE nor NSF funding resulted from the panel&#x27;s recommendation. By this point, however, academic consensus had moved decidedly toward labeling cold fusion as a kind of &quot;pathological science&quot;.

In March 1990, Michael H. Salamon, a physicist from the University of Utah, and nine co-authors reported negative results. University faculty were then &quot;stunned&quot; when a lawyer representing Pons and Fleischmann demanded the Salamon paper be retracted under threat of a lawsuit. The lawyer later apologized; Fleischmann defended the threat as a legitimate reaction to alleged bias displayed by cold-fusion critics.

In early May 1990, one of the two A&amp;M researchers, Kevin Wolf, acknowledged the possibility of spiking, but said that the most likely explanation was tritium contamination in the palladium electrodes or simply contamination due to sloppy work. In June 1990 an article in &quot;Science&quot; by science writer Gary Taubes destroyed the public credibility of the A&amp;M tritium results when it accused its group leader John Bockris and one of his graduate students of spiking the cells with tritium. In October 1990 Wolf finally said that the results were explained by tritium contamination in the rods. An A&amp;M cold fusion review panel found that the tritium evidence was not convincing and that, while they couldn&#x27;t rule out spiking, contamination and measurements problems were more likely explanations, and Bockris never got support from his faculty to resume his research.

On 30 June 1991, the National Cold Fusion Institute closed after it ran out of funds; it found no excess heat, and its reports of tritium production were met with indifference.

On 1 January 1991, Pons left the University of Utah and went to Europe. In 1992, Pons and Fleischmann resumed research with Toyota Motor Corporation&#x27;s IMRA lab in France. Fleischmann left for England in 1995, and the contract with Pons was not renewed in 1998 after spending $40 million with no tangible results. The IMRA laboratory stopped cold fusion research in 1998 after spending £12 million. Pons has made no public declarations since, and only Fleischmann continued giving talks and publishing papers.

Mostly in the 1990s, several books were published that were critical of cold fusion research methods and the conduct of cold fusion researchers. Over the years, several books have appeared that defended them. Around 1998, the University of Utah had already dropped its research after spending over $1 million, and in the summer of 1997, Japan cut off research and closed its own lab after spending $20 million.

== Later research ==

A 1991 review by a cold fusion proponent had calculated &quot;about 600 scientists&quot; were still conducting research. After 1991, cold fusion research only continued in relative obscurity, conducted by groups that had increasing difficulty securing public funding and keeping programs open. These small but committed groups of cold fusion researchers have continued to conduct experiments using Fleischmann and Pons electrolysis setups in spite of the rejection by the mainstream community. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; estimated in 2004 that there were only 100 to 200 researchers working in the field, most suffering damage to their reputation and career. Since the main controversy over Pons and Fleischmann had ended, cold fusion research has been funded by private and small governmental scientific investment funds in the United States, Italy, Japan, and India. For example, it was reported in &quot;Nature&quot;, in May, 2019, that Google had spent approximately $10 million on cold fusion research. A group of scientists at well-known research labs (e.g., MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and others) worked for several years to establish experimental protocols and measurement techniques in an effort to re-evaluate cold fusion to a high standard of scientific rigor. Their reported conclusion: no cold fusion.

In 2021, following &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; 2019 publication of anomalous findings that might only be explained by some localized fusion, scientists at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division announced that they had assembled a group of scientists from the Navy, Army and National Institute of Standards and Technology to undertake a new, coordinated study. With few exceptions, researchers have had difficulty publishing in mainstream journals. The remaining researchers often term their field Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), Chemically Assisted Nuclear Reactions (CANR), Lattice Assisted Nuclear Reactions (LANR), Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) or Lattice Enabled Nuclear Reactions; one of the reasons being to avoid the negative connotations associated with &quot;cold fusion&quot;. The new names avoid making bold implications, like implying that fusion is actually occurring.

The researchers who continue their investigations acknowledge that the flaws in the original announcement are the main cause of the subject&#x27;s marginalization, and they complain of a chronic lack of funding and no possibilities of getting their work published in the highest impact journals. University researchers are often unwilling to investigate cold fusion because they would be ridiculed by their colleagues and their professional careers would be at risk. In 1994, David Goodstein, a professor of physics at Caltech, advocated increased attention from mainstream researchers and described cold fusion as:

===United States===
United States Navy researchers at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) in San Diego have been studying cold fusion since 1989. In 2002 they released a two-volume report, &quot;Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D2O system&quot;, with a plea for funding. This and other published papers prompted a 2004 Department of Energy (DOE) review.

==== 2004 DOE panel ====
In August 2003, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, ordered the DOE to organize a second review of the field. This was thanks to an April 2003 letter sent by MIT&#x27;s Peter L. Hagelstein, and the publication of many new papers, including the Italian ENEA and other researchers in the 2003 International Cold Fusion Conference, and a two-volume book by U.S. SPAWAR in 2002. Cold fusion researchers were asked to present a review document of all the evidence since the 1989 review. The report was released in 2004. The reviewers were &quot;split approximately evenly&quot; on whether the experiments had produced energy in the form of heat, but &quot;most reviewers, even those who accepted the evidence for excess power production, &#x27;stated that the effects are not repeatable, the magnitude of the effect has not increased in over a decade of work, and that many of the reported experiments were not well documented&#x27;&quot;. In summary, reviewers found that cold fusion evidence was still not convincing 15 years later, and they did not recommend a federal research program. They only recommended that agencies consider funding individual well-thought studies in specific areas where research &quot;could be helpful in resolving some of the controversies in the field&quot;. They summarized its conclusions thus:

Cold fusion researchers placed a &quot;rosier spin&quot; on the report, noting that they were finally being treated like normal scientists, and that the report had increased interest in the field and caused &quot;a huge upswing in interest in funding cold fusion research&quot;. However, in a 2009 BBC article on an American Chemical Society&#x27;s meeting on cold fusion, particle physicist Frank Close was quoted stating that the problems that plagued the original cold fusion announcement were still happening: results from studies are still not being independently verified and inexplicable phenomena encountered are being labelled as &quot;cold fusion&quot; even if they are not, in order to attract the attention of journalists.

In February 2012, millionaire Sidney Kimmel, convinced that cold fusion was worth investing in by a 19 April 2009 interview with physicist Robert Duncan on the US news show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, made a grant of $5.5 million to the University of Missouri to establish the Sidney Kimmel Institute for Nuclear Renaissance (SKINR). The grant was intended to support research into the interactions of hydrogen with palladium, nickel or platinum under extreme conditions. In March 2013 Graham K. Hubler, a nuclear physicist who worked for the Naval Research Laboratory for 40 years, was named director. One of the SKINR projects is to replicate a 1991 experiment in which a professor associated with the project, Mark Prelas, says bursts of millions of neutrons a second were recorded, which was stopped because &quot;his research account had been frozen&quot;. He claims that the new experiment has already seen &quot;neutron emissions at similar levels to the 1991 observation&quot;.

In May 2016, the United States House Committee on Armed Services, in its report on the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, directed the Secretary of Defense to &quot;provide a briefing on the military utility of recent U.S. industrial base LENR advancements to the House Committee on Armed Services by September 22, 2016&quot;.

===Italy===

Since the Fleischmann and Pons announcement, the Italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development (ENEA) has funded Franco Scaramuzzi&#x27;s research into whether excess heat can be measured from metals loaded with deuterium gas. Such research is distributed across ENEA departments, CNR laboratories, INFN, universities and industrial laboratories in Italy, where the group continues to try to achieve reliable reproducibility (i.e. getting the phenomenon to happen in every cell, and inside a certain frame of time). In 2006–2007, the ENEA started a research program which claimed to have found excess power of up to 500 percent, and in 2009, ENEA hosted the 15th cold fusion conference.

===Japan===

Between 1992 and 1997, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry sponsored a &quot;New Hydrogen Energy (NHE)&quot; program of US$20 million to research cold fusion. Announcing the end of the program in 1997, the director and one-time proponent of cold fusion research Hideo Ikegami stated &quot;We couldn&#x27;t achieve what was first claimed in terms of cold fusion. (...) We can&#x27;t find any reason to propose more money for the coming year or for the future.&quot; In 1999 the Japan C-F Research Society was established to promote the independent research into cold fusion that continued in Japan. The society holds annual meetings. Perhaps the most famous Japanese cold fusion researcher was Yoshiaki Arata, from Osaka University, who claimed in a demonstration to produce excess heat when deuterium gas was introduced into a cell containing a mixture of palladium and zirconium oxide, a claim supported by fellow Japanese researcher Akira Kitamura of Kobe University and Michael McKubre at SRI.

===India===

In the 1990s, India stopped its research in cold fusion at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre because of the lack of consensus among mainstream scientists and the US denunciation of the research. Yet, in 2008, the National Institute of Advanced Studies recommended that the Indian government revive this research. Projects were commenced at Chennai&#x27;s Indian Institute of Technology, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research. However, there is still skepticism among scientists and, for all practical purposes, research has stalled since the 1990s. A special section in the Indian multidisciplinary journal &quot;Current Science&quot; published 33 cold fusion papers in 2015 by major cold fusion researchers including several Indian researchers.

==Reported results==
A cold fusion experiment usually includes:
* a metal, such as palladium or nickel, in bulk, thin films or powder; and
* deuterium, hydrogen, or both, in the form of water, gas or plasma.

Electrolysis cells can be either open cell or closed cell. In open cell systems, the electrolysis products, which are gaseous, are allowed to leave the cell. In closed cell experiments, the products are captured, for example by catalytically recombining the products in a separate part of the experimental system. These experiments generally strive for a steady state condition, with the electrolyte being replaced periodically. There are also &quot;heat-after-death&quot; experiments, where the evolution of heat is monitored after the electric current is turned off.

The most basic setup of a cold fusion cell consists of two electrodes submerged in a solution containing palladium and heavy water. The electrodes are then connected to a power source to transmit electricity from one electrode to the other through the solution. Even when anomalous heat is reported, it can take weeks for it to begin to appear—this is known as the &quot;loading time,&quot; the time required to saturate the palladium electrode with hydrogen (see &quot;Loading ratio&quot; section).

The Fleischmann and Pons early findings regarding helium, neutron radiation and tritium were never replicated satisfactorily, and its levels were too low for the claimed heat production and inconsistent with each other. Neutron radiation has been reported in cold fusion experiments at very low levels using different kinds of detectors, but levels were too low, close to background, and found too infrequently to provide useful information about possible nuclear processes.

===Excess heat and energy production===
An excess heat observation is based on an energy balance. Various sources of energy input and output are continuously measured. Under normal conditions, the energy input can be matched to the energy output to within experimental error. In experiments such as those run by Fleischmann and Pons, an electrolysis cell operating steadily at one temperature transitions to operating at a higher temperature with no increase in applied current. If the higher temperatures were real, and not an experimental artifact, the energy balance would show an unaccounted term. In the Fleischmann and Pons experiments, the rate of inferred excess heat generation was in the range of 10–20% of total input, though this could not be reliably replicated by most researchers. Researcher Nathan Lewis discovered that the excess heat in Fleischmann and Pons&#x27;s original paper was not measured, but estimated from measurements that didn&#x27;t have any excess heat.

Unable to produce excess heat or neutrons, and with positive experiments being plagued by errors and giving disparate results, most researchers declared that heat production was not a real effect and ceased working on the experiments. In 1993, after their original report, Fleischmann reported &quot;heat-after-death&quot; experiments—where excess heat was measured after the electric current supplied to the electrolytic cell was turned off. This type of report has also become part of subsequent cold fusion claims.

===Helium, heavy elements, and neutrons===

Known instances of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce nucleons and particles on readily observable ballistic trajectories. In support of their claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a neutron flux of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detection of tritium. The classical branching ratio for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 watt of power, the production of 1012 neutrons per second, levels that would have been fatal to the researchers. In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported what they called the first scientific report of highly energetic neutrons, using CR-39 plastic radiation detectors, but the claims cannot be validated without a quantitative analysis of neutrons.

Several medium and heavy elements like calcium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper and zinc have been reported as detected by several researchers, like Tadahiko Mizuno or George Miley. The report presented to the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004 indicated that deuterium-loaded foils could be used to detect fusion reaction products and, although the reviewers found the evidence presented to them as inconclusive, they indicated that those experiments did not use state-of-the-art techniques.

In response to doubts about the lack of nuclear products, cold fusion researchers have tried to capture and measure nuclear products correlated with excess heat. Considerable attention has been given to measuring 4He production. However, the reported levels are very near to background, so contamination by trace amounts of helium normally present in the air cannot be ruled out. In the report presented to the DOE in 2004, the reviewers&#x27; opinion was divided on the evidence for 4He, with the most negative reviews concluding that although the amounts detected were above background levels, they were very close to them and therefore could be caused by contamination from air.

One of the main criticisms of cold fusion was that deuteron-deuteron fusion into helium was expected to result in the production of gamma rays—which were not observed and were not observed in subsequent cold fusion experiments. Cold fusion researchers have since claimed to find X-rays, helium, neutrons and nuclear transmutations. Some researchers also claim to have found them using only light water and nickel cathodes. The 2004 DOE panel expressed concerns about the poor quality of the theoretical framework cold fusion proponents presented to account for the lack of gamma rays.

==Proposed mechanisms==
Researchers in the field do not agree on a theory for cold fusion. One proposal considers that hydrogen and its isotopes can be absorbed in certain solids, including palladium hydride, at high densities. This creates a high partial pressure, reducing the average separation of hydrogen isotopes. However, the reduction in separation is not enough to create the fusion rates claimed in the original experiment, by a factor of ten. It was also proposed that a higher density of hydrogen inside the palladium and a lower potential barrier could raise the possibility of fusion at lower temperatures than expected from a simple application of Coulomb&#x27;s law. Electron screening of the positive hydrogen nuclei by the negative electrons in the palladium lattice was suggested to the 2004 DOE commission, but the panel found the theoretical explanations not convincing and inconsistent with current physics theories.

==Criticism==
Criticism of cold fusion claims generally take one of two forms: either pointing out the theoretical implausibility that fusion reactions have occurred in electrolysis setups or criticizing the excess heat measurements as being spurious, erroneous, or due to poor methodology or controls. There are several reasons why known fusion reactions are an unlikely explanation for the excess heat and associated cold fusion claims.

===Repulsion forces===
Because nuclei are all positively charged, they strongly repel one another. Normally, in the absence of a catalyst such as a muon, very high kinetic energies are required to overcome this charged repulsion. Extrapolating from known fusion rates, the rate for uncatalyzed fusion at room-temperature energy would be 50 orders of magnitude lower than needed to account for the reported excess heat. In muon-catalyzed fusion there are more fusions because the presence of the muon causes deuterium nuclei to be 207 times closer than in ordinary deuterium gas. But deuterium nuclei inside a palladium lattice are further apart than in deuterium gas, and there should be fewer fusion reactions, not more.

Paneth and Peters in the 1920s already knew that palladium can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen gas, storing it at several thousands of times the atmospheric pressure. This led them to believe that they could increase the nuclear fusion rate by simply loading palladium rods with hydrogen gas. Tandberg then tried the same experiment but used electrolysis to make palladium absorb more deuterium and force the deuterium further together inside the rods, thus anticipating the main elements of Fleischmann and Pons&#x27; experiment. They all hoped that pairs of hydrogen nuclei would fuse together to form helium, which at the time was needed in Germany to fill zeppelins, but no evidence of helium or of increased fusion rate was ever found.

This was also the belief of geologist Palmer, who convinced Steven Jones that the helium-3 occurring naturally in Earth perhaps came from fusion involving hydrogen isotopes inside catalysts like nickel and palladium. This led their team in 1986 to independently make the same experimental setup as Fleischmann and Pons (a palladium cathode submerged in heavy water, absorbing deuterium via electrolysis). Fleischmann and Pons had much the same belief, but they calculated the pressure to be of 1027 atmospheres, when cold fusion experiments achieve a loading ratio of only one to one, which has only between 10,000 and 20,000 atmospheres. John R. Huizenga says they had misinterpreted the Nernst equation, leading them to believe that there was enough pressure to bring deuterons so close to each other that there would be spontaneous fusions.

===Lack of expected reaction products===
Conventional deuteron fusion is a two-step process, in which an unstable high-energy intermediary is formed:
:H + H → He + 24 MeV
Experiments have shown only three decay pathways for this excited-state nucleus, with the branching ratio showing the probability that any given intermediate follows a particular pathway. The products formed via these decay pathways are:
:He → n + He + 3.3 MeV (ratio=50%)
:He → p + H + 4.0 MeV (ratio=50%)
:He → He + γ + 24 MeV (ratio=10)
Only about one in a million of the intermediaries take the third pathway, making its products very rare compared to the other paths. This result is consistent with the predictions of the Bohr model. If 1 watt (6.242 × 10 eV/s) were produced from ~2.2575 × 10 deuteron fusions per second, with the known branching ratios, the resulting neutrons and tritium (H) would be easily measured. Some researchers reported detecting He but without the expected neutron or tritium production; such a result would require branching ratios strongly favouring the third pathway, with the actual rates of the first two pathways lower by at least five orders of magnitude than observations from other experiments, directly contradicting both theoretically predicted and observed branching probabilities. Those reports of He production did not include detection of gamma rays, which would require the third pathway to have been changed somehow so that gamma rays are no longer emitted.

The known rate of the decay process together with the inter-atomic spacing in a metallic crystal makes heat transfer of the 24 MeV excess energy into the host metal lattice prior to the intermediary&#x27;s decay inexplicable by conventional understandings of momentum and energy transfer, and even then there would be measurable levels of radiation. Also, experiments indicate that the ratios of deuterium fusion remain constant at different energies. In general, pressure and chemical environment cause only small changes to fusion ratios. An early explanation invoked the Oppenheimer–Phillips process at low energies, but its magnitude was too small to explain the altered ratios.

===Setup of experiments===
Cold fusion setups utilize an input power source (to ostensibly provide activation energy), a platinum group electrode, a deuterium or hydrogen source, a calorimeter, and, at times, detectors to look for byproducts such as helium or neutrons. Critics have variously taken issue with each of these aspects and have asserted that there has not yet been a consistent reproduction of claimed cold fusion results in either energy output or byproducts. Some cold fusion researchers who claim that they can consistently measure an excess heat effect have argued that the apparent lack of reproducibility might be attributable to a lack of quality control in the electrode metal or the amount of hydrogen or deuterium loaded in the system. Critics have further taken issue with what they describe as mistakes or errors of interpretation that cold fusion researchers have made in calorimetry analyses and energy budgets.

====Reproducibility====
In 1989, after Fleischmann and Pons had made their claims, many research groups tried to reproduce the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, without success. A few other research groups, however, reported successful reproductions of cold fusion during this time. In July 1989, an Indian group from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (P. K. Iyengar and M. Srinivasan) and in October 1989, John Bockris&#x27; group from Texas A&amp;M University reported on the creation of tritium. In December 1990, professor Richard Oriani of the University of Minnesota reported excess heat.

Groups that did report successes found that some of their cells were producing the effect, while other cells that were built exactly the same and used the same materials were not. Researchers who continued to work on the topic have claimed over the years that many successful replications had been made, but still had problems getting reliable replications. Reproducibility is one of the main principles of the scientific method, and its lack led most physicists to believe that the few positive reports could be attributed to experimental error. The DOE 2004 report said among its conclusions and recommendations:

=====Loading ratio=====
Cold fusion researchers (McKubre since 1994, ENEA in 2011) have speculated that a cell that is loaded with a deuterium/palladium ratio lower than 100% (or 1:1) will not produce excess heat. Since most of the negative replications from 1989 to 1990 did not report their ratios, this has been proposed as an explanation for failed reproducibility. This loading ratio is hard to obtain, and some batches of palladium never reach it because the pressure causes cracks in the palladium, allowing the deuterium to escape. Fleischmann and Pons never disclosed the deuterium/palladium ratio achieved in their cells; there were no longer any batches of the palladium used by Fleischmann and Pons because the supplier changed the manufacturing process, and researchers still had problems finding batches of palladium that achieved heat production reliably.

====Misinterpretation of data====
Some research groups initially reported that they had replicated the Fleischmann and Pons results but later retracted their reports and offered an alternative explanation for their original positive results. A group at Georgia Tech found problems with their neutron detector, and Texas A&amp;M discovered bad wiring in their thermometers. These retractions, combined with negative results from some famous laboratories, led most scientists to conclude, as early as 1989, that no positive result should be attributed to cold fusion.

====Calorimetry errors====
The calculation of excess heat in electrochemical cells involves certain assumptions. Errors in these assumptions have been offered as non-nuclear explanations for excess heat.

One assumption made by Fleischmann and Pons is that the efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible resistive heating and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged. This assumption gives the amount of energy expended converting liquid D2O into gaseous D2 and O2. The efficiency of electrolysis is less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter. Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolysis experiments.

Another assumption is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.

== Publications ==
The ISI identified cold fusion as the scientific topic with the largest number of published papers in 1989, of all scientific disciplines. The Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger declared himself a supporter of cold fusion in the fall of 1989, after much of the response to the initial reports had turned negative. He tried to publish his theoretical paper &quot;Cold Fusion: A Hypothesis&quot; in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, but the peer reviewers rejected it so harshly that he felt deeply insulted, and he resigned from the American Physical Society (publisher of &quot;PRL&quot;) in protest.

The number of papers sharply declined after 1990 because of two simultaneous phenomena: first, scientists abandoned the field; second, journal editors declined to review new papers. Consequently, cold fusion fell off the ISI charts. Researchers who got negative results turned their backs on the field; those who continued to publish were simply ignored. A 1993 paper in &quot;Physics Letters A&quot; was the last paper published by Fleischmann, and &quot;one of the last reports [by Fleischmann] to be formally challenged on technical grounds by a cold fusion skeptic.&quot;

The &quot;Journal of Fusion Technology&quot; (FT) established a permanent feature in 1990 for cold fusion papers, publishing over a dozen papers per year and giving a mainstream outlet for cold fusion researchers. When editor-in-chief George H. Miley retired in 2001, the journal stopped accepting new cold fusion papers. This has been cited as an example of the importance of sympathetic influential individuals to the publication of cold fusion papers in certain journals.

The decline of publications in cold fusion has been described as a &quot;failed information epidemic&quot;. The sudden surge of supporters until roughly 50% of scientists support the theory, followed by a decline until there is only a very small number of supporters, has been described as a characteristic of pathological science. The lack of a shared set of unifying concepts and techniques has prevented the creation of a dense network of collaboration in the field; researchers perform efforts in their own and in disparate directions, making the transition to &quot;normal&quot; science more difficult.

Cold fusion reports continued to be published in a few journals like &quot;Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry&quot; and &quot;Il Nuovo Cimento&quot;. Some papers also appeared in &quot;Journal of Physical Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Physics Letters A&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Hydrogen Energy&quot;, and a number of Japanese and Russian journals of physics, chemistry, and engineering. Since 2005, &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot; has published cold fusion papers; in 2009, the journal named a cold fusion researcher to its editorial board. In 2015 the Indian multidisciplinary journal &quot;Current Science&quot; published a special section devoted entirely to cold fusion related papers.

In the 1990s, the groups that continued to research cold fusion and their supporters established (non-peer-reviewed) periodicals such as &quot;Fusion Facts&quot;, &quot;Cold Fusion Magazine&quot;, &quot;Infinite Energy Magazine&quot; and &quot;New Energy Times&quot; to cover developments in cold fusion and other fringe claims in energy production that were ignored in other venues. The internet has also become a major means of communication and self-publication for CF researchers.

== Conferences ==
Cold fusion researchers were for many years unable to get papers accepted at scientific meetings, prompting the creation of their own conferences. The International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF) was first held in 1990 and has met every 12 to 18 months since. Attendees at some of the early conferences were described as offering no criticism to papers and presentations for fear of giving ammunition to external critics, thus allowing the proliferation of crackpots and hampering the conduct of serious science. Critics and skeptics stopped attending these conferences, with the notable exception of Douglas Morrison, who died in 2001. With the founding in 2004 of the International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ISCMNS), the conference was renamed the International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science—for reasons that are detailed in the subsequent research section above—but reverted to the old name in 2008. Cold fusion research is often referenced by proponents as &quot;low-energy nuclear reactions&quot;, or LENR, but according to sociologist Bart Simon the &quot;cold fusion&quot; label continues to serve a social function in creating a collective identity for the field.

Since 2006, the American Physical Society (APS) has included cold fusion sessions at their semiannual meetings, clarifying that this does not imply a softening of skepticism. Since 2007, the American Chemical Society (ACS) meetings also include &quot;invited symposium(s)&quot; on cold fusion. An ACS program chair, Gopal Coimbatore, said that without a proper forum the matter would never be discussed and, &quot;with the world facing an energy crisis, it is worth exploring all possibilities.&quot;

On 22–25 March 2009, the American Chemical Society meeting included a four-day symposium in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of the announcement of cold fusion. Researchers working at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) reported detection of energetic neutrons using a heavy water electrolysis setup and a CR-39 detector, a result previously published in &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot;. The authors claim that these neutrons are indicative of nuclear reactions. Without quantitative analysis of the number, energy, and timing of the neutrons and exclusion of other potential sources, this interpretation is unlikely to find acceptance by the wider scientific community.

==Patents==
Although details have not surfaced, it appears that the University of Utah forced the 23 March 1989 Fleischmann and Pons announcement to establish priority over the discovery and its patents before the joint publication with Jones. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced on 12 April 1989 that it had applied for its own patents based on theoretical work of one of its researchers, Peter L. Hagelstein, who had been sending papers to journals from 5 to 12 April. An MIT graduate student applied for a patent but was reportedly rejected by the USPTO in part by the citation of the &quot;negative&quot; MIT Plasma Fusion Center&#x27;s cold fusion experiment of 1989. On 2 December 1993 the University of Utah licensed all its cold fusion patents to ENECO, a new company created to profit from cold fusion discoveries, and in March 1998 it said that it would no longer defend its patents.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) now rejects patents claiming cold fusion. Esther Kepplinger, the deputy commissioner of patents in 2004, said that this was done using the same argument as with perpetual motion machines: that they do not work. Patent applications are required to show that the invention is &quot;useful&quot;, and this utility is dependent on the invention&#x27;s ability to function. In general USPTO rejections on the sole grounds of the invention&#x27;s being &quot;inoperative&quot; are rare, since such rejections need to demonstrate &quot;proof of total incapacity&quot;, and cases where those rejections are upheld in a Federal Court are even rarer: nevertheless, in 2000, a rejection of a cold fusion patent was appealed in a Federal Court and it was upheld, in part on the grounds that the inventor was unable to establish the utility of the invention.

A U.S. patent might still be granted when given a different name to disassociate it from cold fusion, though this strategy has had little success in the US: the same claims that need to be patented can identify it with cold fusion, and most of these patents cannot avoid mentioning Fleischmann and Pons&#x27; research due to legal constraints, thus alerting the patent reviewer that it is a cold-fusion-related patent. David Voss said in 1999 that some patents that closely resemble cold fusion processes, and that use materials used in cold fusion, have been granted by the USPTO. The inventor of three such patents had his applications initially rejected when they were reviewed by experts in nuclear science; but then he rewrote the patents to focus more on the electrochemical parts so they would be reviewed instead by experts in electrochemistry, who approved them. When asked about the resemblance to cold fusion, the patent holder said that it used nuclear processes involving &quot;new nuclear physics&quot; unrelated to cold fusion. Melvin Miles was granted in 2004 a patent for a cold fusion device, and in 2007 he described his efforts to remove all instances of &quot;cold fusion&quot; from the patent description to avoid having it rejected outright.

At least one patent related to cold fusion has been granted by the European Patent Office.

A patent only legally prevents others from using or benefiting from one&#x27;s invention. However, the general public perceives a patent as a stamp of approval, and a holder of three cold fusion patents said the patents were very valuable and had helped in getting investments.

==Cultural references==
A 1990 Michael Winner film &quot;Bullseye!&quot;, starring Michael Caine and Roger Moore, referenced the Fleischmann and Pons experiment. The film – a comedy – concerned conmen trying to steal scientists&#x27; purported findings. However, the film had a poor reception, described as &quot;appallingly unfunny&quot;.

In &quot;Undead Science&quot;, sociologist Bart Simon gives some examples of cold fusion in popular culture, saying that some scientists use cold fusion as a synonym for outrageous claims made with no supporting proof, and courses of ethics in science give it as an example of pathological science. It has appeared as a joke in &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It was adopted as a software product name Adobe ColdFusion and a brand of protein bars (Cold Fusion Foods). It has also appeared in advertising as a synonym for impossible science, for example a 1995 advertisement for Pepsi Max.

The plot of &quot;The Saint&quot;, a 1997 action-adventure film, parallels the story of Fleischmann and Pons, although with a different ending. In &quot;Undead Science&quot;, Simon posits that film might have affected the public perception of cold fusion, pushing it further into the science fiction realm.

Similarly, the tenth episode of 2000 science fiction TV drama &quot;Life Force&quot; (&quot;Paradise Island&quot;) is also based around cold fusion, specifically the efforts of eccentric scientist Hepzibah McKinley (Amanda Walker), who is convinced she has perfected it based on her father&#x27;s incomplete research into the subject. The episode explores its potential benefits and viability within the ongoing post-apocalyptic global warming scenario of the series.

In the 2023 video game &quot;Atomic Heart&quot;, cold fusion is responsible for nearly all of the technological advances. The video game and television series &quot;Fallout&quot; also features cold fusion as a major source of energy.

<doc id="7466" wikidata="Q948232" url="?curid=7466" title="Coal tar">
<text>Coal tar is a thick dark liquid which is a by-product of the production of coke and coal gas from coal. It is a type of creosote. It has both medical and industrial uses. Medicinally it is a topical medication applied to skin to treat psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). It may be used in combination with ultraviolet light therapy. Industrially it is a railroad tie preservative and used in the surfacing of roads. Coal tar was listed as a known human carcinogen in the first Report on Carcinogens from the U.S. Federal Government, issued in 1980.
Coal tar was discovered circa 1665 and used for medical purposes as early as the 1800s. Circa 1850, the discovery that it could be used as the main raw material for the synthesis of dyes engendered an entire industry. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Coal tar is available as a generic medication and over the counter.
Side effects include skin irritation, sun sensitivity, allergic reactions, and skin discoloration. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby and use during breastfeeding is not typically recommended. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. It is a complex mixture of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heterocyclic compounds. It demonstrates antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-itch, and antiparasitic properties.

== Composition ==
Coal tar is produced through thermal destruction (pyrolysis) of coal. Its composition varies with the process and type of coal used – lignite, bituminous or anthracite.

Coal tar is a mixture of approximately 10,000 chemicals, of which only about 50% have been identified. Most of the chemical compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon:

* polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4-rings: chrysene, fluoranthene, pyrene, triphenylene, naphthacene, benzanthracene, 5-rings: picene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[e]pyrene, benzofluoranthenes, perylene, 6-rings: dibenzopyrenes, dibenzofluoranthenes, benzoperylenes, 7-rings: coronene)
* methylated and polymethylated derivatives, mono- and polyhydroxylated derivatives, and heterocyclic compounds. 

Others: benzene, toluene, xylenes, cumenes, coumarone, indene, benzofuran, naphthalene and methyl-naphthalenes, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenol, cresols, pyridine, picolines, phenanthracene, carbazole, quinolines, fluoranthene. Many of these constituents are known carcinogens.

===Derivatives===
Various phenolic coal tar derivatives have analgesic (pain-killer) properties. These included acetanilide, phenacetin, and paracetamol aka acetaminophen. Paracetamol may be the only coal-tar derived analgesic still in use today. Industrial phenol is now usually synthesized from crude oil rather than coal tar.

Coal tar derivatives are contra-indicated for people with the inherited red cell blood disorder glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency), as they can cause oxidative stress leading to red blood cell breakdown.

== Mechanism of action ==
The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Coal tar is a complex mixture of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heterocyclic compounds.

It is a keratolytic agent, which reduces the growth rate of skin cells and softens the skin&#x27;s keratin.

== Uses ==
=== Medicinal ===
Coal tar is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Coal tar is generally available as a generic medication and over the counter.

Coal tar is used in medicated shampoo, soap and ointment. It demonstrates antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-itch, and antiparasitic properties. It may be applied topically as a treatment for dandruff and psoriasis, and to kill and repel head lice. It may be used in combination with ultraviolet light therapy.

Coal tar may be used in two forms: crude coal tar () or a coal tar solution () also known as liquor carbonis detergens (LCD). Named brands include Denorex, Balnetar, Psoriasin, Tegrin, T/Gel, and Neutar. When used in the extemporaneous preparation of topical medications, it is supplied in the form of coal tar topical solution USP, which consists of a 20% w/v solution of coal tar in alcohol, with an additional 5% w/v of polysorbate 80 USP; this must then be diluted in an ointment base, such as petrolatum.

=== Construction ===
Coal tar was a component of the first sealed roads. In its original development by Edgar Purnell Hooley, tarmac was tar covered with granite chips. Later the filler used was industrial slag. Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and reduce maintenance cost associated with asphalt pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.

Coal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot sealcoat products used to protect the structural integrity of the underlying pavement. Sealcoat products that are coal-tar based typically contain 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch. Research shows it is used throughout the United States of America, however several areas have banned its use in sealcoat products, including the District of Columbia; the city of Austin, Texas; Dane County, Wisconsin; the state of Washington; and several municipalities in Minnesota and others.

=== Industry ===
In modern times, coal tar is mostly traded as fuel and an application for tar, such as roofing. The total value of the trade in coal tar is around US$20 billion each year.

* As a fuel.

* In the manufacture of paints, synthetic dyes (notably tartrazine/Yellow #5), and photographic materials.

* For heating or to fire boilers. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.
* As a source of carbon black.

* As a binder in manufacturing graphite; a considerable portion of the materials in &quot;green blocks&quot; is coke oven volatiles (COV). During the baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial graphite production, most of the coal tar binders are vaporised and are generally burned in an incinerator to prevent release into the atmosphere, as COV and coal tar can be injurious to health.

* As a main component of the electrode paste used in electric arc furnaces. Coal tar pitch act as the binder for solid filler that can be either coke or calcined anthracite, forming electrode paste, also widely known as Söderberg electrode paste.

* As a feed stock for higher-value fractions, such as naphtha, creosote and pitch. In the coal gas era, companies distilled coal tar to separate these out, leading to the discovery of many industrial chemicals. 

:Some British companies included:

** Bonnington Chemical Works
** British Tar Products
** Lancashire Tar Distillers
** Midland Tar Distillers
** Newton, Chambers &amp; Company (owners of Izal brand disinfectant)
** Sadlers Chemicals

== Safety ==
Side effects of coal tar products include skin irritation, sun sensitivity, allergic reactions, and skin discoloration. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby and use during breastfeeding is not typically recommended.

According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, coal tar is a valuable, safe and inexpensive treatment option for millions of people with psoriasis and other scalp or skin conditions. According to the FDA, coal tar concentrations between 0.5% and 5% are considered safe and effective for psoriasis.

=== Cancer ===
Long-term, consistent exposure to coal tar likely increases the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. Evidence is inconclusive whether medical coal tar, which does not remain on the skin for the long periods seen in occupational exposure, causes cancer, because there is insufficient data to make a judgment. While coal tar consistently causes cancer in cohorts of workers with chronic occupational exposure, animal models, and mechanistic studies, the data on short-term use as medicine in humans has so far failed to show any consistently significant increase in rates of cancer.

Coal tar contains many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and it is believed that their metabolites bind to DNA, damaging it. The PAHs found in coal tar and air pollution induce immunosenescence and cytotoxicity in epidermal cells. It&#x27;s possible that the skin can repair itself from this damage after short-term exposure to PAHs but not after long-term exposure. Long-term skin exposure to these compounds can produce &quot;tar warts&quot;, which can progress to squamous cell carcinoma.

Coal tar was one of the first chemical substances proven to cause cancer from occupational exposure, during research in 1775 on the cause of chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma. Modern studies have shown that working with coal tar pitch, such as during the paving of roads or when working on roofs, increases the risk of cancer.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists coal tars as Group 1 carcinogens, meaning they directly cause cancer. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lists coal tars as known human carcinogens.

In response to public health concerns regarding the carcinogenicity of PAHs some municipalities, such as the city of Milwaukee, have banned the use of common coal tar-based road and driveway sealants citing concerns of elevated PAH content in groundwater.

=== Other ===
Coal tar causes increased sensitivity to sunlight, so skin treated with topical coal tar preparations should be protected from sunlight.

The residue from the distillation of high-temperature coal tar, primarily a complex mixture of three or more membered condensed ring aromatic hydrocarbons, was listed on 13 January 2010 as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency.

=== Regulation ===
Exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles can occur in the workplace by breathing, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit) to 0.2 mg/m3 benzene-soluble fraction over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 mg/m3 cyclohexane-extractable fraction over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 80 mg/m3, coal tar pitch volatiles are immediately dangerous to life and health.

When used as a medication in the United States, coal tar preparations are considered over-the-counter drug pharmaceuticals and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
