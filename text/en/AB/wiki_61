<text>In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term &quot;database&quot; is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.

Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.

Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.

==Terminology and overview==
Formally, a &quot;database&quot; refers to a set of related data accessed through the use of a &quot;database management system&quot; (DBMS), which is an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.

Because of the close relationship between them, the term &quot;database&quot; is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.

Outside the world of professional information technology, the term &quot;database&quot; is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.

Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:

* Data definition – Creation, modification and removal of definitions that detail how the data is to be organized.
* Update – Insertion, modification, and deletion of the data itself.
* Retrieval – Selecting data according to specified criteria (e.g., a query, a position in a hierarchy, or a position in relation to other data) and providing that data either directly to the user, or making it available for further processing by the database itself or by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a more or less direct form without modification, as it is stored in the database, or in a new form obtained by altering it or combining it with existing data from the database.
* Administration – Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.

Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model. &quot;Database system&quot; refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.

Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large-volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions.

Since DBMSs comprise a significant market, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.

Databases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the query language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, scalability, resilience, and security.

==History==
The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational, SQL/relational, and post-relational.

The two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL model (network model). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) to follow relationships from one record to another.

The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and they remain dominant: IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS. The dominant database language, standardized SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.

Object databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object–relational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term &quot;post-relational&quot; and also the development of hybrid object–relational databases.

The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL databases, introducing fast key–value stores and document-oriented databases. A competing &quot;next generation&quot; known as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.

===1960s, navigational DBMS===

The introduction of the term &quot;database&quot; coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term &quot;data-base&quot; in a specific technical sense.

As computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and Charles Bachman, author of one such product, the Integrated Data Store (IDS), founded the Database Task Group within CODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of COBOL. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the &quot;CODASYL approach&quot;, and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.

The CODASYL approach offered applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:
#Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented by hashing)
#Navigating relationships (called &quot;sets&quot;) from one record to another
#Scanning all the records in a sequential order

Later systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end users (as distinct from the navigational API). However, CODASYL databases were complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.

IBM also had its own DBMS in 1966, known as Information Management System (IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL&#x27;s network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed: the term was popularized by Bachman&#x27;s 1973 Turing Award presentation &quot;The Programmer as Navigator&quot;. IMS is classified by IBM as a hierarchical database. IDMS and Cincom Systems&#x27; TOTAL databases are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use .

===1970s, relational DBMS===
Edgar F. Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in one of their offshoot offices that were primarily involved in the development of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a &quot;search&quot; facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot;.

In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd&#x27;s idea was to organize the data as a number of &quot;tables&quot;, each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or &quot;relations&quot;) aimed to ensure that each &quot;fact&quot; was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called &quot;views&quot; could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.

Codd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than tables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early implementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to depart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based.
 
The use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to represent cross-table relationships, rather than disk addresses, had two primary motivations. From an engineering perspective, it enabled tables to be relocated and resized without expensive database reorganization. But Codd was more interested in the difference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean mathematical definitions, and it also enabled query operations to be defined in terms of the established discipline of first-order predicate calculus; because these operations have clean mathematical properties, it becomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct ways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is no loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic or network models, though the connections between tables are no longer so explicit.

In the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal structure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a &quot;repeating group&quot; within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to such internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical keys.

For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single variable-length record. In the relational approach, the data would be &quot;normalized&quot; into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.

As well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd changed the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than requiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would use a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access path by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the responsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in terms of mathematical logic.

Codd&#x27;s paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker. They started a project known as INGRES using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to System R in a number of ways, including the use of a &quot;language&quot; for data access, known as QUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.

IBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, PRTV, and a production one, Business System 12, both now discontinued. Honeywell wrote MRDS for Multics, and now there are two new implementations: Alphora Dataphor and Rel. Most other DBMS implementations usually called &quot;relational&quot; are actually SQL DBMSs.

In 1970, the University of Michigan began development of the MICRO Information Management System based on D.L. Childs&#x27; Set-Theoretic Data model. MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by the US Department of Labor, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using the Michigan Terminal System. The system remained in production until 1998.

===Integrated approach===
In the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at a lower cost. Examples were IBM System/38, the early offering of Teradata, and the Britton Lee, Inc. database machine.

Another approach to hardware support for database management was ICL&#x27;s CAFS accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However, this idea is still pursued in certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle (Exadata).

===Late 1970s, SQL DBMS===
IBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd&#x27;s concepts as &quot;System R&quot; in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large &quot;chunk&quot;. Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query language – SQL – had been added. Codd&#x27;s ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as &quot;SQL/DS&quot;, and, later, &quot;Database 2&quot; (IBM Db2).

Larry Ellison&#x27;s Oracle Database (or more simply, Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM&#x27;s papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it was not until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.

Stonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission-critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary data store, as do many large companies and financial institutions).

In Sweden, Codd&#x27;s paper was also read and Mimer SQL was developed in the mid-1970s at Uppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise.

Another data model, the entity–relationship model, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for database design as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entity–relationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model, and the difference between the two has become irrelevant.

===1980s, on the desktop===
The 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 and database software like dBASE. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box. C. Wayne Ratliff, the creator of dBASE, stated: &quot;dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.&quot; dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s.

===1990s, object-oriented===
The 1990s, along with a rise in object-oriented programming, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person&#x27;s data were in a database, that person&#x27;s attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be related to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term &quot;object–relational impedance mismatch&quot; described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object–relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as object–relational mappings (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.

===2000s, NoSQL and NewSQL===
XML databases are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on XML document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records.

NoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing denormalized data, and are designed to scale horizontally.

In recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the CAP theorem, it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.

NewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.

==Use cases==
Databases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see Enterprise software).

Databases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering data or economic models. Examples include computerized library systems, flight reservation systems, computerized parts inventory systems, and many content management systems that store websites as collections of webpages in a database.

==Classification==
One way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example: bibliographic, document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.

* An in-memory database is a database that primarily resides in main memory, but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment.
* An active database includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of database triggers.
* A cloud database relies on cloud technology. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, &quot;in the cloud&quot;, while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a web browser and Open APIs.
* Data warehouses archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use UPCs so that they can be compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and mining data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.
* A deductive database combines logic programming with a relational database.
* A distributed database is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers.
* A document-oriented database is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.
* An embedded database system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application&#x27;s end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance.
*End-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases.
* A federated database system comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a heterogeneous database system), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.
* Sometimes the term &quot;multi-database&quot; is used as a synonym for federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically middleware is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the two-phase commit protocol, to allow distributed (global) transactions across the participating databases.
* A graph database is a kind of NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and network databases.
* An array DBMS is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional arrays such as satellite images and climate simulation output.
* In a hypertext or hypermedia database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be hyperlinked to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users can conveniently jump around the text. The World Wide Web is thus a large distributed hypertext database.
* A knowledge base (abbreviated KB, kb or Δ) is a special kind of database for knowledge management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. Also a collection of data representing problems with their solutions and related experiences.

* A mobile database can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device.
* Operational databases store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions. Examples include customer databases that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business&#x27;s customers, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, enterprise resource planning systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the organization&#x27;s money, accounting and financial dealings.
* A parallel database seeks to improve performance through parallelization for tasks such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.

::The major parallel DBMS architectures which are induced by the underlying hardware architecture are:
::* Shared memory architecture, where multiple processors share the main memory space, as well as other data storage.
::* Shared disk architecture, where each processing unit (typically consisting of multiple processors) has its own main memory, but all units share the other storage.
::* Shared-nothing architecture, where each processing unit has its own main memory and other storage.

* Probabilistic databases employ fuzzy logic to draw inferences from imprecise data.
* Real-time databases process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.
* A spatial database can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location-based queries, like &quot;Where is the closest hotel in my area?&quot;.
* A temporal database has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time.
* A terminology-oriented database builds upon an object-oriented database, often customized for a specific field.
* An unstructured data database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging.

==Database management system==

Connolly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a &quot;software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database.&quot; Examples of DBMS&#x27;s include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and Microsoft Access.

The DBMS acronym is sometimes extended to indicate the underlying database model, with RDBMS for the relational, OODBMS for the object (oriented) and ORDBMS for the object–relational model. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristics, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.

The functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously. The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data. Codd proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose DBMS should provide:

* Data storage, retrieval and update
* User accessible catalog or data dictionary describing the metadata
* Support for transactions and concurrency
* Facilities for recovering the database should it become damaged
* Support for authorization of access and update of data
* Access support from remote locations
* Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain rules

It is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities. The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the database engine.

Often DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use. The trend is to minimize the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as embedded databases the need to target zero-administration is paramount.

The large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and have involved up to thousands of human years of development effort throughout their lifetime.

Early multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via terminals or terminal emulation software. The client–server architecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a multitier architecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a web browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.

A general-purpose DBMS will provide public application programming interfaces (API) and optionally a processor for database languages such as SQL to allow applications to be written to interact with and manipulate the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customized and linked to a single application. For example, an email system performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.

==Application==

External interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS. This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a website that happens to use a database to store and search information.

===Application program interface===

A programmer will code interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a datasource) via an application program interface (API) or via a database language. The particular API or language chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possibly indirectly via a preprocessor or a bridging API. Some API&#x27;s aim to be database independent, ODBC being a commonly known example. Other common API&#x27;s include JDBC and ADO.NET.

==Database languages==

Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:

* Data control language (DCL) – controls access to data;
* Data definition language (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;
* Data manipulation language (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;
* Data query language (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.

Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:

* SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and are supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.
* OQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.
* XQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and Db2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.
* SQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.

A database language may also incorporate features like:

* DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management
* Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing
* Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)
* Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience

==Storage==
Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the &quot;internal&quot; (physical) &quot;level&quot; in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, &quot;data about the data&quot;, and internal data structures) to reconstruct the &quot;conceptual level&quot; and &quot;external level&quot; from the internal level when needed. Databases as digital objects contain three layers of information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and the semantics. Proper storage of all three layers is needed for future preservation and longevity of the database. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. &quot;storage engine&quot;. Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems&#x27; file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration settings are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look at the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels&#x27; reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).

Some DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.

Various low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases.

===Materialized views===
Often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing &quot;materialized views&quot;, which consist of frequently needed &quot;external views&quot; or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.

===Replication===
Occasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to the same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.

===Virtualization===
With data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach.

==Security==

Database security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).

Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) are allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.

This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called &quot;subschemas&quot;. For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.

Data security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see physical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see data encryption).

Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this in the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches. Therefore, organizations must take database security seriously because of the many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransom ware. This helps in protecting the company&#x27;s essential information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause.

==Transactions and concurrency==
Database transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring or releasing a lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction&#x27;s programmer via special transaction commands).

The acronym ACID describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

==Migration==
A database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database&#x27;s transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database&#x27;s conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This is in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help import databases from other popular DBMSs.

==Building, maintaining, and tuning==
After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application&#x27;s data structures within the DBMS&#x27;s respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).

When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application&#x27;s data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.

After the database is created, initialized and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application&#x27;s data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application&#x27;s functionality, etc.

==Backup and restore==

Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database&#x27;s data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.

==Static analysis==
Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *Abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques. The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database systems has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine-grained access control, watermarking, etc.

==Miscellaneous features==

Other DBMS features might include:

* Database logs – This helps in keeping a history of the executed functions.
* Graphics component for producing graphs and charts, especially in a data warehouse system.
* Query optimizer – Performs query optimization on every query to choose an efficient &quot;query plan&quot; (a partial order (tree) of operations) to be executed to compute the query result. May be specific to a particular storage engine.
* Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program maintenance, database performance analysis and monitoring, database configuration monitoring, DBMS hardware configuration (a DBMS and related database may span computers, networks, and storage units) and related database mapping (especially for a distributed DBMS), storage allocation and database layout monitoring, storage migration, etc.

Increasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as &quot;DevOps for database&quot;.

==Design and modeling==
The first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity–relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like &quot;can a customer also be a supplier?&quot;, or &quot;if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?&quot;, or &quot;if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?&quot;. The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.

Producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from business processes, or the analysis of workflow in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.

Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms &quot;data model&quot; and &quot;database model&quot; are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use &quot;data model&quot; for the design of a specific database, and &quot;database model&quot; for the modeling notation used to express that design).

The most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary &quot;fact&quot; is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.

The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called &quot;physical database design&quot;, and the output is the physical data model. A key goal during this stage is data independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.

Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.

===Models===

A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.

Common logical data models for databases include:
*Navigational databases
**Hierarchical database model
**Network model
**Graph database
*Relational model
*Entity–relationship model
**Enhanced entity–relationship model
*Object model
*Document model
*Entity–attribute–value model
*Star schema

An object–relational database combines the two related structures.

Physical data models include:
*Inverted index
*Flat file

Other models include:
*Multidimensional model
*Array model
*Multivalue model

Specialized models are optimized for particular types of data:
*XML database
*Semantic model
*Content store
*Event store
*Time series model

===External, conceptual, and internal views===

A database management system provides three views of the database data:

* The external level defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.
* The conceptual level (or &quot;logical level&quot;) unifies the various external views into a compatible global view. It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.
* The internal level (or &quot;physical level&quot;) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as indexes to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views&#x27; performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.

While there is typically only one conceptual and internal view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company&#x27;s expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of the human resources department. Thus different departments need different &quot;views&quot; of the company&#x27;s database.

The three-level database architecture relates to the concept of &quot;data independence&quot; which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.

The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On the one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.

==Research==

Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research). Research activity includes theory and development of prototypes. Notable research topics have included models, the atomic transaction concept, related concurrency control techniques, query languages and query optimization methods, RAID, and more.

The database research area has several dedicated academic journals (for example, &quot;ACM Transactions on Database Systems&quot;-TODS, &quot;Data and Knowledge Engineering&quot;-DKE) and annual conferences (e.g., ACM SIGMOD, ACM PODS, VLDB, IEEE ICDE).

<doc id="8378" wikidata="Q215589" url="?curid=8378" title="Dipole">
<text>In physics, a dipole () is an electromagnetic phenomenon which occurs in two ways:
* An electric dipole deals with the separation of the positive and negative electric charges found in any electromagnetic system. A simple example of this system is a pair of charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated by some typically small distance. (A permanent electric dipole is called an electret.)
* A magnetic dipole is the closed circulation of an electric current system. A simple example is a single loop of wire with constant current through it. A bar magnet is an example of a magnet with a permanent magnetic dipole moment.

Dipoles, whether electric or magnetic, can be characterized by their dipole moment, a vector quantity. For the simple electric dipole, the electric dipole moment points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges. (To be precise: for the definition of the dipole moment, one should always consider the &quot;dipole limit&quot;, where, for example, the distance of the generating charges should &quot;converge&quot; to 0 while simultaneously, the charge strength should &quot;diverge&quot; to infinity in such a way that the product remains a positive constant.)

For the magnetic (dipole) current loop, the magnetic dipole moment points through the loop (according to the right hand grip rule), with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop.

Similar to magnetic current loops, the electron particle and some other fundamental particles have magnetic dipole moments, as an electron generates a magnetic field identical to that generated by a very small current loop. However, an electron&#x27;s magnetic dipole moment is not due to a current loop, but to an intrinsic property of the electron. The electron may also have an &quot;electric&quot; dipole moment though such has yet to be observed (see electron electric dipole moment).
A permanent magnet, such as a bar magnet, owes its magnetism to the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The two ends of a bar magnet are referred to as poles (not to be confused with monopoles, see Classification below) and may be labeled &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot;. In terms of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, they are respectively &quot;north-seeking&quot; and &quot;south-seeking&quot; poles: if the magnet were freely suspended in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, the north-seeking pole would point towards the north and the south-seeking pole would point towards the south. The dipole moment of the bar magnet points from its magnetic south to its magnetic north pole. In a magnetic compass, the north pole of a bar magnet points north. However, that means that Earth&#x27;s geomagnetic north pole is the &quot;south&quot; pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa.

The only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical spin since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated.

== Classification ==


A &quot;physical dipole&quot; consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field at large distances (i.e., distances large in comparison to the separation of the poles) depends almost entirely on the dipole moment as defined above. A &quot;point (electric) dipole&quot; is the limit obtained by letting the separation tend to 0 while keeping the dipole moment fixed. The field of a point dipole has a particularly simple form, and the order-1 term in the multipole expansion is precisely the point dipole field.

Although there are no known magnetic monopoles in nature, there are magnetic dipoles in the form of the quantum-mechanical spin associated with particles such as electrons (although the accurate description of such effects falls outside of classical electromagnetism). A theoretical magnetic &quot;point dipole&quot; has a magnetic field of exactly the same form as the electric field of an electric point dipole. A very small current-carrying loop is approximately a magnetic point dipole; the magnetic dipole moment of such a loop is the product of the current flowing in the loop and the (vector) area of the loop.

Any configuration of charges or currents has a &#x27;dipole moment&#x27;, which describes the dipole whose field is the best approximation, at large distances, to that of the given configuration. This is simply one term in the multipole expansion when the total charge (&quot;monopole moment&quot;) is 0—as it &quot;always&quot; is for the magnetic case, since there are no magnetic monopoles. The dipole term is the dominant one at large distances: Its field falls off in proportion to , as compared to for the next (quadrupole) term and higher powers of for higher terms, or for the monopole term.

== Molecular dipoles ==

Many molecules have such dipole moments due to non-uniform distributions of positive and negative charges on the various atoms. Such is the case with polar compounds like hydrogen fluoride (HF), where electron density is shared unequally between atoms. Therefore, a molecule&#x27;s dipole is an electric dipole with an inherent electric field that should not be confused with a magnetic dipole, which generates a magnetic field.

The physical chemist Peter J. W. Debye was the first scientist to study molecular dipoles extensively, and, as a consequence, dipole moments are measured in the non-SI unit named &quot;debye&quot; in his honor.

For molecules there are three types of dipoles:
; Permanent dipoles: These occur when two atoms in a molecule have substantially different electronegativity : One atom attracts electrons more than another, becoming more negative, while the other atom becomes more positive. A molecule with a permanent dipole moment is called a &quot;polar&quot; molecule. See dipole–dipole attractions.
; Instantaneous dipoles : These occur due to chance when electrons happen to be more concentrated in one place than another in a molecule, creating a temporary dipole. These dipoles are smaller in magnitude than permanent dipoles, but still play a large role in chemistry and biochemistry due to their prevalence. See instantaneous dipole.
; Induced dipoles : These can occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule&#x27;s electrons, &quot;inducing&quot; a dipole moment in that molecule. A molecule is &quot;polarized&quot; when it carries an induced dipole. See induced-dipole attraction.

More generally, an induced dipole of &quot;any&quot; polarizable charge distribution &quot;ρ&quot; (remember that a molecule has a charge distribution) is caused by an electric field external to &quot;ρ&quot;. This field may, for instance, originate from an ion or polar molecule in the vicinity of &quot;ρ&quot; or may be macroscopic (e.g., a molecule between the plates of a charged capacitor). The size of the induced dipole moment is equal to the product of the strength of the external field and the dipole polarizability of &quot;ρ&quot;.

Dipole moment values can be obtained from measurement of the dielectric constant. Some typical gas phase values given with the unit debye are:
* carbon dioxide: 0
* carbon monoxide: 0.112 D
* ozone: 0.53 D
* phosgene: 1.17 D
* ammonia: 1.42 D
* water vapor: 1.85 D
* hydrogen cyanide: 2.98 D
* cyanamide: 4.27 D
* potassium bromide: 10.41 D
Potassium bromide (KBr) has one of the highest dipole moments because it is an ionic compound that exists as a molecule in the gas phase.
The overall dipole moment of a molecule may be approximated as a vector sum of bond dipole moments. As a vector sum it depends on the relative orientation of the bonds, so that from the dipole moment information can be deduced about the molecular geometry.

For example, the zero dipole of CO2 implies that the two C=O bond dipole moments cancel so that the molecule must be linear. For H2O the O−H bond moments do not cancel because the molecule is bent. For ozone (O3) which is also a bent molecule, the bond dipole moments are not zero even though the O−O bonds are between similar atoms. This agrees with the Lewis structures for the resonance forms of ozone which show a positive charge on the central oxygen atom.

An example in organic chemistry of the role of geometry in determining dipole moment is the &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene. In the &quot;cis&quot; isomer the two polar C−Cl bonds are on the same side of the C=C double bond and the molecular dipole moment is 1.90 D. In the &quot;trans&quot; isomer, the dipole moment is zero because the two C−Cl bonds are on opposite sides of the C=C and cancel (and the two bond moments for the much less polar C−H bonds also cancel).

Another example of the role of molecular geometry is boron trifluoride, which has three polar bonds with a difference in electronegativity greater than the traditionally cited threshold of 1.7 for ionic bonding. However, due to the equilateral triangular distribution of the fluoride ions centered on and in the same plane as the boron cation, the symmetry of the molecule results in its dipole moment being zero.

== Quantum-mechanical dipole operator ==
Consider a collection of &quot;N&quot; particles with charges &quot;qi&quot; and position vectors r&quot;i&quot;. For instance, this collection may be a molecule consisting of electrons, all with charge −&quot;e&quot;, and nuclei with charge &quot;eZi&quot;, where &quot;Zi&quot; is the atomic number of the &quot;i&quot; th nucleus.
The dipole observable (physical quantity) has the quantum mechanical dipole operator:
: formula_1

Notice that this definition is valid only for neutral atoms or molecules, i.e. total charge equal to zero. In the ionized case, we have
: formula_2
where formula_3 is the center of mass of the molecule/group of particles.

== Atomic dipoles ==

A non-degenerate (&quot;S&quot;-state) atom can have only a zero permanent dipole. This fact follows quantum mechanically from the inversion symmetry of atoms. All 3 components of the dipole operator are antisymmetric under inversion with respect to the nucleus,
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the dipole operator and formula_6 is the inversion operator.

The permanent dipole moment of an atom in a non-degenerate state (see degenerate energy level) is given as the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator,
: formula_7
where formula_8 is an &quot;S&quot;-state, non-degenerate, wavefunction, which is symmetric or antisymmetric under inversion: formula_9. Since the product of the wavefunction (in the ket) and its complex conjugate (in the bra) is always symmetric under inversion and its inverse,
: formula_10
it follows that the expectation value changes sign under inversion. We used here the fact that formula_11, being a symmetry operator, is unitary: formula_12 and by definition the Hermitian adjoint formula_13 may be moved from bra to ket and then becomes formula_14. Since the only quantity that is equal to minus itself is the zero, the expectation value vanishes,
: formula_15

In the case of open-shell atoms with degenerate energy levels, one could define a dipole moment by the aid of the first-order Stark effect. This gives a non-vanishing dipole (by definition proportional to a non-vanishing first-order Stark shift) only if some of the wavefunctions belonging to the degenerate energies have opposite parity; i.e., have different behavior under inversion. This is a rare occurrence, but happens for the excited H-atom, where 2s and 2p states are &quot;accidentally&quot; degenerate (see article Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector for the origin of this degeneracy) and have opposite parity (2s is even and 2p is odd).

== Field of a static magnetic dipole ==
=== Magnitude ===
The far-field strength, &quot;B&quot;, of a dipole magnetic field is given by
: formula_16
where
: &quot;B&quot; is the strength of the field, measured in teslas
: &quot;r&quot; is the distance from the center, measured in metres
: &quot;λ&quot; is the magnetic latitude (equal to 90° − &quot;θ&quot;) where &quot;θ&quot; is the magnetic colatitude, measured in radians or degrees from the dipole axis
: &quot;m&quot; is the dipole moment, measured in ampere-square metres or joules per tesla
: &quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability of free space, measured in henries per metre.

Conversion to cylindrical coordinates is achieved using and
: formula_17
where &quot;ρ&quot; is the perpendicular distance from the &quot;z&quot;-axis. Then,
: formula_18

=== Vector form ===
The field itself is a vector quantity:
: formula_19
where
: B is the field
: r is the vector from the position of the dipole to the position where the field is being measured
: &quot;r&quot; is the absolute value of r: the distance from the dipole
: r̂ = is the unit vector parallel to r;
: m is the (vector) dipole moment
: &quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability of free space

This is &quot;exactly&quot; the field of a point dipole, &quot;exactly&quot; the dipole term in the multipole expansion of an arbitrary field, and &quot;approximately&quot; the field of any dipole-like configuration at large distances.

=== Magnetic vector potential ===
The vector potential A of a magnetic dipole is
: formula_20
with the same definitions as above.

== Field from an electric dipole ==

The electrostatic potential at position r due to an electric dipole at the origin is given by:
: formula_21
where p is the (vector) dipole moment, and &quot;є&quot;0 is the permittivity of free space.

This term appears as the second term in the multipole expansion of an arbitrary electrostatic potential Φ(r). If the source of Φ(r) is a dipole, as it is assumed here, this term is the only non-vanishing term in the multipole expansion of Φ(r). The electric field from a dipole can be found from the gradient of this potential:
: formula_22

This is of the same form of the expression for the magnetic field of a point magnetic dipole, ignoring the delta function. 
In a real electric dipole, however, the charges are physically separate and the electric field diverges or converges at the point charges. 
This is different to the magnetic field of a real magnetic dipole which is continuous everywhere. The delta function represents the strong field pointing in the opposite direction between the point charges, which is often omitted since one is rarely interested in the field at the dipole&#x27;s position. 
For further discussions about the internal field of dipoles, see or &quot;&quot;.

== Torque on a dipole ==
Since the direction of an electric field is defined as the direction of the force on a positive charge, electric field lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.

When placed in a homogeneous electric or magnetic field, equal but opposite forces arise on each side of the dipole creating a torque }:
: formula_23
for an electric dipole moment p (in coulomb-meters), or
: formula_24
for a magnetic dipole moment m (in ampere-square meters).

The resulting torque will tend to align the dipole with the applied field, which in the case of an electric dipole, yields a potential energy of
: formula_25.

The energy of a magnetic dipole is similarly
: formula_26.

== Dipole radiation ==

In addition to dipoles in electrostatics, it is also common to consider an electric or magnetic dipole that is oscillating in time. It is an extension, or a more physical next-step, to spherical wave radiation.

In particular, consider a harmonically oscillating electric dipole, with angular frequency &quot;ω&quot; and a dipole moment &quot;p&quot;0 along the ẑ direction of the form
: formula_27

In vacuum, the exact field produced by this oscillating dipole can be derived using the retarded potential formulation as:
: formula_28

For  ≫ 1, the far-field takes the simpler form of a radiating &quot;spherical&quot; wave, but with angular dependence embedded in the cross-product:
: formula_29

The time-averaged Poynting vector
: formula_30
is not distributed isotropically, but concentrated around the directions lying perpendicular to the dipole moment, as a result of the non-spherical electric and magnetic waves. In fact, the spherical harmonic function (sin &quot;θ&quot;) responsible for such toroidal angular distribution is precisely the &quot;l&quot; = 1 &quot;p&quot; wave.

The total time-average power radiated by the field can then be derived from the Poynting vector as
: formula_31

Notice that the dependence of the power on the fourth power of the frequency of the radiation is in accordance with the Rayleigh scattering, and the underlying effects why the sky consists of mainly blue colour.

A circular polarized dipole is described as a superposition of two linear dipoles.

<text>Draught beer, also spelt draft, is beer served from a cask or keg rather than from a bottle or can. Draught beer served from a pressurised keg is also known as 

== Name ==

Until Joseph Bramah patented the beer engine in 1785, beer was served directly from the barrel and carried to the customer. The Old English &quot;&quot; (&quot;carry; pull&quot;) developed into a series of related words including &quot;drag&quot;, &quot;draw&quot;, and &quot;draught&quot;. By the time Bramah&#x27;s beer pumps became popular, the use of the term &quot;draught&quot; to refer to the acts of serving or drinking beer was well established and transferred easily to beer served via the hand pumps. In time, the word came to be restricted to only such beer. The usual spelling is now &quot;draught&quot; in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand and more commonly &quot;draft&quot; in North America, although it can be spelt either way. Regardless of spelling, the word is pronounced or depending on the region the speaker is from.

Canned draught is beer served from a pressurised container featuring a widget. Smooth flow (also known as cream flow, nitrokeg, or smooth) is the name brewers give to draught beers pressurised with a partial nitrogen gas blend.

== History ==
In 1691, an article in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; mentioned John Lofting, who held a patent for a fire engine: &quot;The said patentee has also projected a very useful engine for starting of beer, and other liquors which will draw from 20 to 30 barrels an hour, which are completely fixed with brass joints and screws at reasonable rates&quot;.

In the early 20th century, draught beer started to be served from pressurised containers. Artificial carbonation was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1936, with Watney&#x27;s experimental pasteurised beer Red Barrel. Though this method of serving beer did not take hold in the UK until the late 1950s, it did become the favoured method in the rest of Europe, where it is known by such terms as &quot;en pression&quot;. The carbonation method of serving beer subsequently spread to the rest of the world; by the early 1970s the term &quot;draught beer&quot; almost exclusively referred to beer served under pressure as opposed to the traditional cask or barrel beer.

In Britain, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) was founded in 1971 to protect traditional—unpressurised—beer and brewing methods. The group devised the term &quot;real ale&quot; to differentiate between beer served from the cask and beer served under pressure. The term &quot;real ale&quot; has since been expanded to include bottle-conditioned beer.

== Keg beer ==

Keg beer is often filtered and/or pasteurised, both of which are processes that render the yeast inactive.

In brewing parlance, a keg is different from a cask. A cask has a tap hole near the edge of the top, and a spile hole on the side used for conditioning the unfiltered and unpasteurised beer. A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after fermentation with carbon dioxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas or especially in Czech Republic solely compressed air.

&quot;Keg&quot; has become a term of contempt used by some, particularly in the UK, since the 1960s when pasteurised draught beers started replacing traditional cask beers.

Keg beer was replacing traditional cask ale in all parts of the UK, primarily because it requires less care to handle. Since 1971, CAMRA has conducted a consumer campaign on behalf of those who prefer traditional cask beer. CAMRA has lobbied the British Parliament to ensure support for cask ale and microbreweries have sprung up to serve those consumers who prefer traditional cask beer.

Pressurised CO2 in the keg&#x27;s headspace maintains carbonation in the beer. The CO2 pressure varies depending on the amount of CO2 already in the beer and the keg storage temperature. Occasionally the CO2 gas is blended with nitrogen gas. CO2 / nitrogen blends are used to allow a higher operating pressure in complex dispensing systems.

Nitrogen is used under high pressure when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO2 to (artificially) form a rich tight head and a less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a foamy appearance. Premixed bottled gas for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2. This premixed gas, which only works well with creamy beers, is often referred to as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal (an Air Liquide brand name). Using &quot;Beer Gas&quot; with other beer styles can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat and lifeless. In the UK, the term &quot;keg beer&quot; would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurised.

Cask beer should be stored and served at a cellar temperature of . Once a cask is opened, it should be consumed within three days. Keg beer is given additional cooling just prior to being served either by flash coolers or a remote cooler in the cellar. This chills the beer to temperatures between .

== Canned and bottled &quot;draught&quot; ==

The words &quot;draft&quot; and &quot;draught&quot; have been used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers, implying that they taste and appear like beers from a cask or keg. Commercial brewers use this as a marketing tool although it is incorrect to call any beer not drawn from a cask or keg &quot;draught&quot;. Two examples are Miller Genuine Draft, a pale lager which is produced using a cold filtering system, and Guinness stout in patented &quot;Draught-flow&quot; cans and bottles. Guinness is an example of beers that use a nitrogen widget to create a smooth beer with a dense head. Guinness has recently replaced the widget system from their bottled &quot;draught&quot; beer with a coating of cellulose fibres on the inside of the bottle. Statements indicate a new development in bottling technology that enables the mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide to be present in the beer without using a widget, making it according to Guinness &quot;more drinkable&quot; from the bottle.

In East Asian countries, such as China and Japan, the term &quot;draft beer&quot; () applied to canned or bottled beer indicates that the beer is not pasteurised (though it may be filtered), giving it a fresher taste but shorter shelf-life than conventional packaged beers.

<doc id="8389" wikidata="Q42844" url="?curid=8389" title="Major depressive disorder">
<text>Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood, low self-esteem, and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s, the term was adopted by the American Psychiatric Association for this symptom cluster under mood disorders in the 1980 version of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-III), and has become widely used since. The disorder causes the second-most years lived with disability, after lower back pain. 

The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person&#x27;s reported experiences, behavior reported by family or friends, and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for the disorder, but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is in a person&#x27;s 20s, with females affected about three times as often as males. The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent major depressive episodes.

Those with major depressive disorder are typically treated with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may be significant only in the most severely depressed. Hospitalization (which may be involuntary) may be necessary in cases with associated self-neglect or a significant risk of harm to self or others. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered if other measures are not effective.

Major depressive disorder is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, with about 40% of the risk being genetic. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, childhood traumas, environmental lead exposure, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance use disorders. It can negatively affect a person&#x27;s personal life, work life, or education, and cause issues with a person&#x27;s sleeping habits, eating habits, and general health. 
==Signs and symptoms==
A person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an inability to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Depressed people may be preoccupied with or ruminate over thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness or hopelessness.

Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory, withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive, irritability, and thoughts of death or suicide. Insomnia is common; in the typical pattern, a person wakes very early and cannot get back to sleep. Hypersomnia, or oversleeping, can also happen, as well as day-night rhythm disturbances, such as diurnal mood variation. Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect. In severe cases, depressed people may have psychotic symptoms. These symptoms include delusions or, less commonly, hallucinations, usually unpleasant. People who have had previous episodes with psychotic symptoms are more likely to have them with future episodes.

A depressed person may report multiple physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or digestive problems; physical complaints are the most common presenting problem in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization&#x27;s criteria for depression. Appetite often decreases, resulting in weight loss, although increased appetite and weight gain occasionally occur.

Major depression significantly affects a person&#x27;s family and personal relationships, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. Family and friends may notice agitation or lethargy. Older depressed people may have cognitive symptoms of recent onset, such as forgetfulness, and a more noticeable slowing of movements.

Depressed children may often display an irritable rather than a depressed mood; most lose interest in school and show a steep decline in academic performance. Diagnosis may be delayed or missed when symptoms are interpreted as &quot;normal moodiness&quot;. Elderly people may not present with classical depressive symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases.

==Cause==
The etiology of depression is not yet fully understood. The biopsychosocial model proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role in causing depression. The diathesis–stress model specifies that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or diathesis, is activated by stressful life events. The preexisting vulnerability can be either genetic, implying an interaction between nature and nurture, or schematic, resulting from views of the world learned in childhood. American psychiatrist Aaron Beck suggested that a triad of automatic and spontaneous negative thoughts about the self, the world or environment, and the future may lead to other depressive signs and symptoms.

===Genetics===
Genes play a major role in the development of depression. Family and twin studies find that nearly 40% of individual differences in risk for major depressive disorder can be explained by genetic factors. Like most psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder is likely influenced by many individual genetic changes. In 2018, a genome-wide association study discovered 44 genetic variants linked to risk for major depression; a 2019 study found 102 variants in the genome linked to depression. However, it appears that major depression is less heritable compared to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Research focusing on specific candidate genes has been criticized for its tendency to generate false positive findings. There are also other efforts to examine interactions between life stress and polygenic risk for depression.

===Other health problems===
Depression can also arise after a chronic or terminal medical condition, such as HIV/AIDS or asthma, and may be labeled &quot;secondary depression&quot;. It is unknown whether the underlying diseases induce depression through effect on quality of life, or through shared etiologies (such as degeneration of the basal ganglia in Parkinson&#x27;s disease or immune dysregulation in asthma). Depression may also be iatrogenic (the result of healthcare), such as drug-induced depression. Therapies associated with depression include interferons, beta-blockers, isotretinoin, contraceptives, cardiac agents, anticonvulsants, antimigraine drugs, antipsychotics, and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). Celiac disease is another possible contributing factor.

Substance use in early age is associated with increased risk of developing depression later in life. Depression occurring after giving birth is called postpartum depression and is thought to be the result of hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression associated with seasonal changes in sunlight, is thought to be triggered by decreased sunlight.
Vitamin B2, B6 and B12 deficiency may cause depression in females.

A 2025 study suggests that depression affects not only mental health but also accelerates the development of chronic physical conditions. Individuals with a history of depression are at a higher risk of developing long-term health issues, including heart disease and diabetes. Researchers found that, among more than 172,500 adults in the UK aged 39 and older, those with a history of depression experienced the onset of chronic illnesses approximately 30% earlier than those without depression. 

===Environmental===
Adverse childhood experiences (incorporating childhood abuse, neglect and family dysfunction) markedly increase the risk of major depression, especially if more than one type. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, poor responsiveness to treatment and length of illness. Some are more susceptible than others to developing mental illness such as depression after trauma, and various genes have been suggested to control susceptibility. Couples in unhappy marriages have a higher risk of developing clinical depression.

There appears to be a link between air pollution and depression and suicide. There may be an association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and depression, and a possible association between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide.

==Pathophysiology==

The pathophysiology of depression is not completely understood, but current theories center around monoaminergic systems, the circadian rhythm, immunological dysfunction, HPA-axis dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.

Derived from the effectiveness of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, the monoamine theory posits that insufficient activity of monoamine neurotransmitters is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. First, acute depletion of tryptophan—a necessary precursor of serotonin and a monoamine—can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of people who are depressed, suggesting that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression. Second, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the 5-HTTLPR gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link. Third, decreased size of the locus coeruleus, decreased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, increased density of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, and evidence from rat models suggest decreased adrenergic neurotransmission in depression. Furthermore, decreased levels of homovanillic acid, altered response to dextroamphetamine, responses of depressive symptoms to dopamine receptor agonists, decreased dopamine receptor D1 binding in the striatum, and polymorphism of dopamine receptor genes implicate dopamine, another monoamine, in depression. Lastly, increased activity of monoamine oxidase, which degrades monoamines, has been associated with depression. However, the monoamine theory is inconsistent with observations that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway.

One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in raphe nuclei by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants. However, disinhibition of the dorsal raphe has been proposed to occur as a result of &quot;decreased&quot; serotonergic activity in tryptophan depletion, resulting in a depressed state mediated by increased serotonin. Further countering the monoamine hypothesis is the fact that rats with lesions of the dorsal raphe are not more depressive than controls, the finding of increased jugular 5-HIAA in people who are depressed that normalized with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, and the preference for carbohydrates in people who are depressed. Already limited, the monoamine hypothesis has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public. A 2022 review found no consistent evidence supporting the serotonin hypothesis, linking serotonin levels and depression.

HPA-axis abnormalities have been suggested in depression given the association of CRHR1 with depression and the increased frequency of dexamethasone test non-suppression in people who are depressed. However, this abnormality is not adequate as a diagnosis tool, because its sensitivity is only 44%. These stress-related abnormalities are thought to be the cause of hippocampal volume reductions seen in people who are depressed. Furthermore, a meta-analysis yielded decreased dexamethasone suppression, and increased response to psychological stressors. Further abnormal results have been obscured with the cortisol awakening response, with increased response being associated with depression.

There is also a connection between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, otherwise known as the Gut-Brain axis, which is a two-way communication system between the brain and the gut. Experiments have shown that microbiota in the gut can play an important role in depression as people with MDD often have gut-brain dysfunction. One analysis showed that those with MDD have different bacteria living in their guts. Bacteria &quot;Bacteroidetes&quot; and &quot;Firmicutes&quot; were most affected in people with MDD, and they are also impacted in people with irritable bowel syndrome. Another study showed that people with IBS have a higher chance of developing depression, which shows the two are connected. There is even evidence suggesting that altering the microbes in the gut can have regulatory effects on developing depression.

Theories unifying neuroimaging findings have been proposed. The first model proposed is the limbic-cortical model, which involves hyperactivity of the ventral paralimbic regions and hypoactivity of frontal regulatory regions in emotional processing. Another model, the cortico-striatal model, suggests that abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex in regulating striatal and subcortical structures result in depression. Another model proposes hyperactivity of salience structures in identifying negative stimuli, and hypoactivity of cortical regulatory structures resulting in a negative emotional bias and depression, consistent with emotional bias studies.

=== Immune pathogenesis theories on depression ===
The newer field of psychoneuroimmunology, the study between the immune system and the nervous system and emotional state, suggests that cytokines may impact depression.

Immune system abnormalities have been observed, including increased levels of cytokines -cells produced by immune cells that affect inflammation- involved in generating sickness behavior, creating a pro-inflammatory profile in MDD. Some people with depression have increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and some have decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Research suggests that treatments can reduce pro-inflammatory cell production, like the experimental treatment of ketamine with treatment-resistant depression. With this, in MDD, people will more likely have a Th-1 dominant immune profile, which is a pro-inflammatory profile. This suggests that there are components of the immune system affecting the pathology of MDD.

Another way cytokines can affect depression is in the kynurenine pathway, and when this is overactivated, it can cause depression. This can be due to too much microglial activation and too little astrocytic activity. When microglia get activated, they release pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause an increase in the production of COX2. This, in turn, causes the production of PGE2, which is a prostaglandin, and this catalyzes the production of indolamine, IDO. IDO causes tryptophan to get converted into kynurenine and kynurenine becomes quinolinic acid. Quinolinic acid is an agonist for NMDA receptors, so it activates the pathway. Studies have shown that the post-mortem brains of patients with MDD have higher levels of quinolinic acid than people who did not have MDD. With this, researchers have also seen that the concentration of quinolinic acid correlates to the severity of depressive symptoms.

==Diagnosis==

===Assessment===
A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained general practitioner, or by a psychiatrist or psychologist, who records the person&#x27;s current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, family history, and alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a mental state examination, which is an assessment of the person&#x27;s current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or pessimism, self-harm or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans. Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to primary-care clinicians. This issue is even more marked in developing countries. Rating scales are not used to diagnose depression, but they provide an indication of the severity of symptoms for a time period, so a person who scores above a given cut-off point can be more thoroughly evaluated for a depressive disorder diagnosis. Several rating scales are used for this purpose; these include the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Beck Depression Inventory or the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised.

Primary-care physicians have more difficulty with underrecognition and undertreatment of depression compared to psychiatrists. These cases may be missed because for some people with depression, physical symptoms often accompany depression. In addition, there may also be barriers related to the person, provider, and/or the medical system. Non-psychiatrist physicians have been shown to miss about two-thirds of cases, although there is some evidence of improvement in the number of missed cases.

A doctor generally performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of depressive symptoms. These include blood tests measuring TSH and thyroxine to exclude hypothyroidism; basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance; and a full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease. Adverse affective reactions to medications or alcohol misuse may be ruled out, as well. Testosterone levels may be evaluated to diagnose hypogonadism, a cause of depression in men. Vitamin D levels might be evaluated, as low levels of vitamin D have been associated with greater risk for depression. Subjective cognitive complaints appear in older depressed people, but they can also be indicative of the onset of a dementing disorder, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Cognitive testing and brain imaging can help distinguish depression from dementia. A CT scan can exclude brain pathology in those with psychotic, rapid-onset or otherwise unusual symptoms. No biological tests confirm major depression. In general, investigations are not repeated for a subsequent episode unless there is a medical indication.

===DSM and ICD criteria===
The most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) and the World Health Organization&#x27;s &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&quot; (ICD). The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations, and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other. Both DSM and ICD mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms. The most recent edition of the DSM is the Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), and the most recent edition of the ICD is the Eleventh Edition (ICD-11).

Under mood disorders, ICD-11 classifies major depressive disorder as either &quot;single episode depressive disorder&quot; (where there is no history of depressive episodes, or of mania) or &quot;recurrent depressive disorder&quot; (where there is a history of prior episodes, with no history of mania). ICD-11 symptoms, present nearly every day for at least two weeks, are a depressed mood or anhedonia, accompanied by other symptoms such as &quot;difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue.&quot; These symptoms must affect work, social, or domestic activities. The ICD-11 system allows further specifiers for the current depressive episode: the severity (mild, moderate, severe, unspecified); the presence of psychotic symptoms (with or without psychotic symptoms); and the degree of remission if relevant (currently in partial remission, currently in full remission). These two disorders are classified as &quot;Depressive disorders&quot;, in the category of &quot;Mood disorders&quot;.

According to DSM-5, at least one of the symptoms is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Depressed mood occurs nearly every day as subjective feelings like sadness, emptiness, and hopelessness or observations made by others (e.g. appears tearful). Loss of interest or pleasure occurs in all, or almost all activities of the day, nearly every day. These symptoms, as well as five out of the nine more specific symptoms listed, must frequently occur for more than two weeks (to the extent in which it impairs functioning) for the diagnosis. Major depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in the DSM-5. The diagnosis hinges on the presence of single or recurrent major depressive episodes. Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category Unspecified Depressive Disorder is diagnosed if the depressive episode&#x27;s manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

====Major depressive episode====

A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks. Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features—commonly referred to as &quot;psychotic depression&quot;—is automatically rated as severe. If the person has had an episode of mania or markedly elevated mood, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made instead. Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as &quot;unipolar&quot; because the mood remains at one emotional state or &quot;pole&quot;.

Bereavement is not an exclusion criterion in the DSM-5, and it is up to the clinician to distinguish between normal reactions to a loss and MDD. Excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including dysthymia, which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance; recurrent brief depression, consisting of briefer depressive episodes; minor depressive disorder, whereby only some symptoms of major depression are present; and adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which denotes low mood resulting from a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor.

====Subtypes====
The DSM-5 recognizes six further subtypes of MDD, called &quot;specifiers&quot;, in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:
* &quot;Melancholic depression&quot; is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of grief or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, psychomotor retardation, excessive weight loss (not to be confused with anorexia nervosa), or excessive guilt.
* &quot;Atypical depression&quot; is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant weight gain or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness (hypersomnia), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant long-term social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection.
* &quot;Catatonic depression&quot; is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in schizophrenia or in manic episodes, or may be caused by neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
* &quot;Depression with anxious distress&quot; was added into the DSM-5 as a means to emphasize the common co-occurrence between depression or mania and anxiety, as well as the risk of suicide of depressed individuals with anxiety. Specifying in such a way can also help with the prognosis of those diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder.
* &quot;Depression with peri-partum onset&quot; refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth or while a woman is pregnant. DSM-IV-TR used the classification &quot;postpartum depression&quot;, but this was changed to not exclude cases of depressed woman during pregnancy. Depression with peripartum onset has an incidence rate of 3–6% among new mothers. The DSM-5 mandates that to qualify as depression with peripartum onset, onset occurs during pregnancy or within one month of delivery.
* &quot;Seasonal affective disorder&quot; (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.

===Differential diagnoses===
To confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other potential diagnoses must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. Dysthymia is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as &quot;double depression&quot;). Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, medications, and substance use disorders. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination. When the depression is caused by a medication, non-medical use of a psychoactive substance, or exposure to a toxin, it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called &quot;substance-induced mood disorder&quot;).

==Screening and prevention==
Preventive efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%. Since 2016, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening for depression among those over the age 12; though a 2005 Cochrane review found that the routine use of screening questionnaires has little effect on detection or treatment. Screening the general population is not recommended by authorities in the UK or Canada.

Behavioral interventions, such as interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are effective at preventing new onset depression. Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the Internet.

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the &quot;Coping with Depression&quot; course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.

==Management==

The most common and effective treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); a combination of treatments is the most effective approach when depression is resistant to treatment. American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and personal preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, ECT, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all people with severe depression unless ECT is planned. There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.

Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), third wave CBT and interpersonal therapy may help prevent depression. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.

Treatment options are more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.

===Lifestyle===
Physical exercise has been found to be effective for major depression, and may be recommended to people who are willing, motivated, and healthy enough to participate in an exercise program as treatment. It is equivalent to the use of medications or psychological therapies in most people. In older people it does appear to decrease depression. Sleep and diet may also play a role in depression, and interventions in these areas may be an effective add-on to conventional methods. In studies, smoking cessation has benefits in depression.

===Talking therapies===

Talking therapy (psychotherapy) can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals, including psychotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses. A 2012 review found psychotherapy to be better than no treatment but not other treatments. With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used. There is moderate-quality evidence that psychological therapies are a useful addition to standard antidepressant treatment of treatment-resistant depression in the short term. Psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people. Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been stopped or replaced by occasional booster sessions.

The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. CBT can perform as well as antidepressants in people with major depression. CBT has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression. In people under 18, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy. Several variables predict success for cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents: higher levels of rational thoughts, less hopelessness, fewer negative thoughts, and fewer cognitive distortions. CBT is particularly beneficial in preventing relapse. Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression. Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being rational emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms. Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth. Problem solving therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and interpersonal therapy are effective interventions in the elderly.

Psychoanalysis is a school of thought, founded by Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the resolution of unconscious mental conflicts. Psychoanalytic techniques are used by some practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression. A more widely practiced therapy, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is in the tradition of psychoanalysis but less intensive, meeting once or twice a week. It also tends to focus more on the person&#x27;s immediate problems, and has an additional social and interpersonal focus. In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.

===Antidepressants===

Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression. A review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs, such as escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline, have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo. Antidepressants work less well for the elderly than for younger individuals with depression.

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50 to 75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement. Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence, and even up to one year of continuation is recommended. People with chronic depression may need to take medication indefinitely to avoid relapse.

SSRIs are the primary medications prescribed, owing to their relatively mild side-effects, and because they are less toxic in overdose than other antidepressants. People who do not respond to one SSRI can be switched to another antidepressant, and this results in improvement in almost 50% of cases. Another option is to augment the atypical antidepressant bupropion to the SSRI as an adjunctive treatment. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, may be modestly more effective than SSRIs. However, venlafaxine is not recommended in the UK as a first-line treatment because of evidence suggesting its risks may outweigh benefits, and it is specifically discouraged in children and adolescents as it increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts.
For children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe depressive disorder, fluoxetine seems to be the best treatment (either with or without cognitive behavioural therapy) but more research is needed to be certain. Sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine might also help in reducing symptoms. Some antidepressants have not been shown to be effective. Medications are not recommended in children with mild disease.

There is also insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness in those with depression complicated by dementia. Any antidepressant can cause low blood sodium levels; nevertheless, it has been reported more often with SSRIs. It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating atypical antidepressant mirtazapine can be used in such cases.

Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, an older class of antidepressants, have been plagued by potentially life-threatening dietary and drug interactions. They are still used only rarely, although newer and better-tolerated agents of this class have been developed. The safety profile is different with reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as moclobemide, where the risk of serious dietary interactions is negligible and dietary restrictions are less strict.
It is unclear whether antidepressants affect a person&#x27;s risk of suicide. For children, adolescents, and probably young adults between 18 and 24 years old, there is a higher risk of both suicidal ideations and suicidal behavior in those treated with SSRIs. For adults, it is unclear whether SSRIs affect the risk of suicidality. One review found no connection; another an increased risk; and a third no risk in those 25–65 years old and a decreased risk in those more than 65. A black box warning was introduced in the United States in 2007 on SSRIs and other antidepressant medications due to the increased risk of suicide in people younger than 24 years old. Similar precautionary notice revisions were implemented by the Japanese Ministry of Health.

===Other medications and supplements===
The combined use of antidepressants plus benzodiazepines demonstrates improved effectiveness when compared to antidepressants alone, but these effects may not endure. The addition of a benzodiazepine is balanced against possible harms and other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant mono-therapy is considered inadequate.

For treatment-resistant depression, adding on the atypical antipsychotic brexpiprazole for short-term or acute management may be considered. Brexpiprazole may be effective for some people, however, the evidence as of 2023 supporting its use is weak and this medication has potential adverse effects including weight gain and akathisia. Brexpiprazole has not been sufficiently studied in older people or children and the use and effectiveness of this adjunctive therapy for longer term management is not clear.

Ketamine may have a rapid antidepressant effect lasting less than two weeks; there is limited evidence of any effect after that, common acute side effects, and longer-term studies of safety and adverse effects are needed. A nasal spray form of esketamine was approved by the FDA in March 2019 for use in treatment-resistant depression when combined with an oral antidepressant; risk of substance use disorder and concerns about its safety, serious adverse effects, tolerability, effect on suicidality, lack of information about dosage, whether the studies on it adequately represent broad populations, and escalating use of the product have been raised by an international panel of experts.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors are effective in treating depression. For instance, Celecoxib, an NSAID, is a selective COX-2 inhibitor– which is an enzyme that helps in the production of pain and inflammation. In recent clinical trials, this NSAID has been shown helpful with treatment-resistant depression as it helps inhibit proinflammatory signaling.

Statins, which are anti-inflammatory medications prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, have also been shown to have antidepressant effects. When prescribed for patients already taking SSRIs, this add-on treatment was shown to improve anti-depressant effects of SSRIs when compared to the placebo group. With this, statins have been shown to be effective in preventing depression in some cases too.

There is insufficient high quality evidence to suggest omega-3 fatty acids are effective in depression. There is limited evidence that vitamin D supplementation is of value in alleviating the symptoms of depression in individuals who are vitamin D-deficient. Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general population. There is a narrow range of effective and safe dosages of lithium thus close monitoring may be needed. Low-dose thyroid hormone may be added to existing antidepressants to treat persistent depression symptoms in people who have tried multiple courses of medication. Limited evidence suggests stimulants, such as amphetamine and modafinil, may be effective in the short term, or as adjuvant therapy. Also, it is suggested that folate supplements may have a role in depression management. There is tentative evidence for benefit from testosterone in males.

===Electroconvulsive therapy===
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a standard psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in a person with depression to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses. ECT is used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder. A round of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is unipolar or bipolar. Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond relapse within twelve months. Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia. Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.

A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week, until the person no longer has symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a muscle relaxant. Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some people receive maintenance ECT.

ECT appears to work in the short term via an anticonvulsant effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via neurotrophic effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.

===Other===
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain. TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (trMDD) in 2008. Recent systematic reviews have found that the effects of TMS on clinical response, remission, and severity in depression appear not to be statistically or clinically significant. The American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders, and the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have endorsed TMS for trMDD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain with a weak electric current. Several meta-analyses have concluded that active tDCS was useful for treating depression.

There is a small amount of evidence that sleep deprivation may improve depressive symptoms in some individuals, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary. Besides sleepiness, this method can cause a side effect of mania or hypomania. There is insufficient evidence for Reiki and dance movement therapy in depression. Cannabis is specifically not recommended as a treatment.

The microbiome of people with major depressive disorder differs from that of healthy people, and probiotic and synbiotic treatment may achieve a modest depressive symptom reduction. With this, fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) are being researched as add-on therapy treatments for people who do not respond to typical therapies. It has been shown that the patient&#x27;s depressive symptoms improved, with minor gastrointestinal issues, after a FMT, with improvements in symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks after the transplant.

==Prognosis==
Studies have shown that 80% of those with a first major depressive episode will have at least one more during their life, with a lifetime average of four episodes. Other general population studies indicate that around half those who have an episode recover (whether treated or not) and remain well, while the other half will have at least one more, and around 15% of those experience chronic recurrence. Studies recruiting from selective inpatient sources suggest lower recovery and higher chronicity, while studies of mostly outpatients show that nearly all recover, with a median episode duration of 11 months. Around 90% of those with severe or psychotic depression, most of whom also meet criteria for other mental disorders, experience recurrence. Cases when outcome is poor are associated with inappropriate treatment, severe initial symptoms including psychosis, early age of onset, previous episodes, incomplete recovery after one year of treatment, pre-existing severe mental or medical disorder, and family dysfunction.

A high proportion of people who experience full symptomatic remission still have at least one not fully resolved symptom after treatment. Recurrence or chronicity is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment. Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six months after remission to prevent relapse. Evidence from many randomized controlled trials indicates continuing antidepressant medications after recovery can reduce the chance of relapse by 70% (41% on placebo vs. 18% on antidepressant). The preventive effect probably lasts for at least the first 36 months of use.

Major depressive episodes often resolve over time, whether or not they are treated. Outpatients on a waiting list show a 10–15% reduction in symptoms within a few months, with approximately 20% no longer meeting the full criteria for a depressive disorder. The median duration of an episode has been estimated to be 23 weeks, with the highest rate of recovery in the first three months. According to a 2013 review, 23% of untreated adults with mild to moderate depression will remit within 3 months, 32% within 6 months and 53% within 12 months.

===Ability to work===
Depression may affect people&#x27;s ability to work. The combination of usual clinical care and support with return to work (like working less hours or changing tasks) probably reduces sick leave by 15%, and leads to fewer depressive symptoms and improved work capacity, reducing sick leave by an annual average of 25 days per year. Helping depressed people return to work without a connection to clinical care has not been shown to have an effect on sick leave days. Additional psychological interventions (such as online cognitive behavioral therapy) lead to fewer sick days compared to standard management only. Streamlining care or adding specific providers for depression care may help to reduce sick leave.

===Life expectancy and the risk of suicide===
Depressed individuals have a shorter life expectancy than those without depression, in part because people who are depressed are at risk of dying of suicide. About 50% of people who die of suicide have a mood disorder such as major depression, and the risk is especially high if a person has a marked sense of hopelessness or has both depression and borderline personality disorder. About 2–8% of adults with major depression die by suicide. In the US, the lifetime risk of suicide associated with a diagnosis of major depression is estimated at 7% for men and 1% for women, even though suicide attempts are more frequent in women.

Depressed people also have a higher rate of dying from other causes. There is a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing cardiovascular disorders, further increasing their risk of medical complications. Cardiologists may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.

==Epidemiology==

Major depressive disorder affected approximately 163 million people in 2017 (2% of the global population). The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France. In most countries the number of people who have depression during their lives falls within an 8–18% range. Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%).

In the United States, 8.4% of adults (21 million individuals) have at least one episode within a year-long period; the probability of having a major depressive episode is higher for females than males (10.5% to 6.2%), and highest for those aged 18 to 25 (17%). 15% of adolescents, ages 12 to 17, in America are also affected by depression, which is equal to 3.7 million teenagers. Among individuals reporting two or more races, the US prevalence is highest. Out of all the people suffering from MDD, only about 35% seek help from a professional for their disorder.

Major depression is about twice as common in women as in men, although it is unclear why this is so, and whether factors unaccounted for are contributing to this. The relative increase in occurrence is related to pubertal development rather than chronological age, reaches adult ratios between the ages of 15 and 18, and appears associated with psychosocial more than hormonal factors. In 2019, major depressive disorder was identified (using either the DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10) in the Global Burden of Disease Study as the fifth most common cause of years lived with disability and the 18th most common for disability-adjusted life years.

People are most likely to develop their first depressive episode between the ages of 30 and 40, and there is a second, smaller peak of incidence between ages 50 and 60. The risk of major depression is increased with neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, or multiple sclerosis, and during the first year after childbirth (Postpartum depression). It is also more common after cardiovascular illnesses, and is related more to those with a poor cardiac disease outcome than to a better one. Depressive disorders are more common in urban populations than in rural ones and the prevalence is increased in groups with poorer socioeconomic factors, e.g., homelessness. Depression is common among those over 65 years of age and increases in frequency beyond this age. The risk of depression increases in relation to the frailty of the individual. Depression is one of the most important factors which negatively impact quality of life in adults, as well as the elderly. Both symptoms and treatment among the elderly differ from those of the rest of the population.

Major depression was the leading cause of disease burden in North America and other high-income countries, and the fourth-leading cause worldwide as of 2006. In the year 2030, it is predicted to be the second-leading cause of disease burden worldwide after HIV, according to the WHO. Delay or failure in seeking treatment after relapse and the failure of health professionals to provide treatment are two barriers to reducing disability.

===Comorbidity===
Major depression frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 &quot;National Comorbidity Survey&quot; (US) reported that half of those with major depression also have lifetime anxiety and its associated disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptoms can have a major impact on the course of a depressive illness, with delayed recovery, increased risk of relapse, greater disability and increased suicidal behavior. Depressed people have increased rates of alcohol and substance use, particularly dependence, and around a third of individuals diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) develop comorbid depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression often co-occur. Depression may also coexist with ADHD, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of both. Depression is also frequently comorbid with alcohol use disorder and personality disorders. Depression can also be exacerbated during particular months (usually winter) in those with seasonal affective disorder. While overuse of digital media has been associated with depressive symptoms, using digital media may also improve mood in some situations.

Depression and pain often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of people who have depression, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of people who are experiencing pain will also have depression, depending on the setting—a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. Depression is often underrecognized, and therefore undertreated, in patients presenting with pain. Depression often coexists with physical disorders common among the elderly, such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

==History==
The Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates described a syndrome of melancholia (, ) as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all &quot;fears and despondencies, if they last a long time&quot; as being symptomatic of the ailment. It was a similar but far broader concept than today&#x27;s depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.

The term &quot;depression&quot; itself was derived from the Latin verb , meaning &quot;to press down&quot;. From the 14th century, &quot;to depress&quot; meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author Richard Baker&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; to refer to someone having &quot;a great depression of spirit&quot;, and by English author Samuel Johnson in a similar sense in 1753. The term also came into use in physiology and economics. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist Louis Delasiauve in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function. Since Aristotle, melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. However, by the 19th century, this association has largely shifted and melancholia became more commonly linked with women.

Although &quot;melancholia&quot; remained the dominant diagnostic term, &quot;depression&quot; gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as &quot;depressive states&quot;. Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper &quot;Mourning and Melancholia&quot;. He theorized that objective loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in subjective loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an unconscious, narcissistic process called the &quot;libidinal cathexis&quot; of the ego. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively but the ego itself is compromised. The person&#x27;s decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness. He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor. Adolf Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing &quot;reactions&quot; in the context of an individual&#x27;s life, and argued that the term &quot;depression&quot; should be used instead of &quot;melancholia&quot;. The first version of the &quot;DSM&quot; (&quot;DSM-I&quot;, 1952) contained &quot;depressive reaction&quot; and the &quot;DSM-II&quot; (1968) &quot;depressive neurosis&quot;, defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.

The term &quot;unipolar&quot; (along with the related term &quot;bipolar&quot;) was coined by the neurologist and psychiatrist Karl Kleist, and subsequently used by his disciples Edda Neele and Karl Leonhard.

The term &quot;Major depressive disorder&quot; was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the &quot;Research Diagnostic Criteria&quot;, building on earlier Feighner Criteria), and was incorporated into the &quot;DSM-III&quot; in 1980. The American Psychiatric Association added &quot;major depressive disorder&quot; to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM-III&quot;), as a split of the previous depressive neurosis in the &quot;DSM-II&quot;, which also encompassed the conditions now known as dysthymia and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. To maintain consistency the ICD-10 used the same criteria, with only minor alterations, but using the &quot;DSM&quot; diagnostic threshold to mark a &quot;mild depressive episode&quot;, adding higher threshold categories for moderate and severe episodes. The ancient idea of &quot;melancholia&quot; still survives in the notion of a melancholic subtype.

The new definitions of depression were widely accepted, albeit with some conflicting findings and views. There have been some continued empirically based arguments for a return to the diagnosis of melancholia. There has been some criticism of the expansion of coverage of the diagnosis, related to the development and promotion of antidepressants and the biological model since the late 1950s.

==Society and culture==
===Terminology===
The term &quot;depression&quot; is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or simply to a low mood. People&#x27;s conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. &quot;Because of the lack of scientific certainty,&quot; one commentator has observed, &quot;the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—&#x27;disease,&#x27; &#x27;disorder,&#x27; &#x27;state of mind&#x27;—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it.&quot; There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.

===Cultural dimension===
Cultural differences contribute to different prevalence of symptoms. &quot;Do the Chinese somatize depression? A cross-cultural study&quot; by Parker &quot;et al.&quot; discusses the cultural differences in prevalent symptoms of depression between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The authors reveal that individuals with depression in collectivistic cultures tend to present more somatic symptoms and less affective symptoms compared to those in individualistic cultures. The finding suggests that individualistic cultures &#x27;warranting&#x27; or validating one&#x27;s expression of emotions explains this cultural difference since collectivistic cultures see this as a taboo against the social cooperation it deems one of the most significant values.

===Stigma===
Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to social stigma about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings, or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression. People who may have had depression include English author Mary Shelley, American-British writer Henry James, and American president Abraham Lincoln. Some well-known contemporary people with possible depression include Canadian songwriter Leonard Cohen and American playwright and novelist Tennessee Williams. Some pioneering psychologists, such as Americans William James and John B. Watson, dealt with their own depression.

There has been a continuing discussion of whether neurological disorders and mood disorders may be linked to creativity, a discussion that goes back to Aristotelian times. British literature gives many examples of reflections on depression. English philosopher John Stuart Mill experienced a several-months-long period of what he called &quot;a dull state of nerves&quot;, when one is &quot;unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement; one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times, becomes insipid or indifferent&quot;. He quoted English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Dejection&quot; as a perfect description of his case: &quot;A grief without a pang, void, dark and drear, / A drowsy, stifled, unimpassioned grief, / Which finds no natural outlet or relief / In word, or sigh, or tear.&quot; English writer Samuel Johnson used the term &quot;the black dog&quot; in the 1780s to describe his own depression, and it was subsequently popularized by British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, who also had the disorder. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his &quot;Faust, Part One&quot;, published in 1808, has Mephistopheles assume the form of a black dog, specifically a poodle.

Social stigma of major depression is widespread, and contact with mental health services reduces this only slightly. Public opinions on treatment differ markedly to those of health professionals; alternative treatments are held to be more helpful than pharmacological ones, which are viewed poorly. In the UK, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners conducted a joint Five-year Defeat Depression campaign to educate and reduce stigma from 1992 to 1996; a MORI study conducted afterwards showed a small positive change in public attitudes to depression and treatment.

While serving his first term as Prime Minister of Norway, Kjell Magne Bondevik attracted international attention in August 1998 when he announced that he was suffering from a depressive episode, becoming the highest ranking world leader to admit to suffering from a mental illness while in office. Upon this revelation, Anne Enger became acting Prime Minister for three weeks, from 30 August to 23 September, while he recovered from the depressive episode. Bondevik then returned to office. Bondevik received thousands of supportive letters, and said that the experience had been positive overall, both for himself and because it made mental illness more publicly acceptable.

<doc id="8391" wikidata="Q132543" url="?curid=8391" title="Diana (mythology)">
<text>Diana is a goddess in Roman and Hellenistic religion, primarily considered a patroness of the countryside and nature, hunters, wildlife, childbirth, crossroads, the night, and the Moon. She is equated with the Greek goddess Artemis, and absorbed much of Artemis&#x27; mythology early in Roman history, including a birth on the island of Delos to parents Jupiter and Latona, and a twin brother, Apollo, though she had an independent origin in Italy.

Diana is considered a virgin goddess and protector of childbirth. Historically, Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities: Egeria the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and Virbius, the woodland god.

Diana is revered in modern neopagan religions including Roman neopaganism, Stregheria, and Wicca. In the ancient, medieval, and modern periods, Diana has been considered a triple deity, merged with a goddess of the moon (Luna/Selene) and the underworld (usually Hecate).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Dīāna&quot; probably derives from Latin (&#x27;godly&#x27;), ultimately from Proto-Italic &quot;*dīwī&quot;, meaning &#x27;divine, heavenly&#x27;. It stems from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*diwyós&quot; (&#x27;divine, heavenly&#x27;), formed with the stem (&#x27;daylight sky&#x27;) attached the thematic suffix -&quot;yós&quot;. Cognates appear in Myceanean Greek &quot;di-wi-ja&quot;, in Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; (; &#x27;belonging to heaven, godlike&#x27;), and in Sanskrit (&#x27;heavenly&#x27; or &#x27;celestial&#x27;).

The ancient Latin writers Varro and Cicero considered the etymology of Dīāna as allied to that of &quot;dies&quot; and connected to the shine of the Moon, noting that one of her titles is Diana Lucifera (&quot;light-bearer&quot;).

... people regard Diana and the moon as one and the same. ... the moon &quot;(luna)&quot; is so called from the verb to shine &quot;(lucere)&quot;. Lucina is identified with it, which is why in our country they invoke Juno Lucina in childbirth, just as the Greeks call on Diana the Light-bearer. Diana also has the name &quot;Omnivaga&quot; (&quot;wandering everywhere&quot;), not because of her hunting but because she is numbered as one of the seven planets; her name Diana derives from the fact that she turns darkness into daylight &quot;(dies)&quot;. She is invoked at childbirth because children are born occasionally after seven, or usually after nine, lunar revolutions ...
:--Quintus Lucilius Balbus as recorded by Marcus Tullius Cicero and translated by P.G. Walsh. &quot;De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)&quot;, Book II, Part ii, Section c 

==Description==
===As a goddess of the countryside===

The persona of Diana is complex, and contains a number of archaic features. Diana was originally considered to be a goddess of the wilderness and of the hunt, a central sport in both Roman and Greek culture. Early Roman inscriptions to Diana celebrated her primarily as a huntress and patron of hunters. Later, in the Hellenistic period, Diana came to be equally or more revered as a goddess not of the wild woodland but of the &quot;tame&quot; countryside, or &quot;villa rustica&quot;, the idealization of which was common in Greek thought and poetry. This dual role as goddess of both civilization and the wild, and therefore the civilized countryside, first applied to the Greek goddess Artemis (for example, in the 3rd century BCE poetry of Anacreon).

By the 3rd century CE, after Greek influence had a profound impact on Roman religion, Diana had been almost fully combined with Artemis and took on many of her attributes, both in her spiritual domains and in the description of her appearance. The Roman poet Nemesianus wrote a typical description of Diana: She carried a bow and a quiver full of golden arrows, wore a golden cloak, purple half-boots, and a belt with a jeweled buckle to hold her tunic together, and wore her hair gathered in a ribbon. By the 5th century CE, almost a millennia after her cult&#x27;s entry into Rome, the philosopher Proclus could still characterize Diana as &quot;the inspective guardian of every thing rural, [who] represses every thing rustic and uncultivated.&quot;

===As a triple goddess===
Diana was often considered an aspect of a triple goddess, known as &quot;Diana triformis&quot;: Diana, Luna, and Hecate. According to historian C.M. Green, &quot;these were neither different goddesses nor an amalgamation of different goddesses. They were Diana...Diana as huntress, Diana as the moon, Diana of the underworld.&quot; At her sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi, Diana was venerated as a triple goddess beginning in the late 6th century BCE.

Andreas Alföldi interpreted an image on a late Republican coin as the Latin Diana &quot;conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate&quot;. This coin, minted by P. Accoleius Lariscolus in 43 BCE, has been acknowledged as representing an archaic statue of Diana Nemorensis. It represents Artemis with the bow at one extremity, Luna-Selene with flowers at the other and a central deity not immediately identifiable, all united by a horizontal bar. The iconographical analysis allows the dating of this image to the 6th century at which time there are Etruscan models. The coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the &quot;lucus&quot; of Nemi in 43 BCE. Lake Nemi was called &quot;Triviae lacus&quot; by Virgil (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 7.516), while Horace called Diana &quot;montium custos nemoremque virgo&quot; (&quot;keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi&quot;) and &quot;diva triformis&quot; (&quot;three-form goddess&quot;).

Two heads found in the sanctuary and the Roman theatre at Nemi, which have a hollow on their back, lend support to this interpretation of an archaic triple Diana.

===As goddess of crossroads and the underworld===
The earliest epithet of Diana was &quot;Trivia&quot;, and she was addressed with that title by Virgil, Catullus, and many others. &quot;Trivia&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;trivium&quot;, &quot;triple way&quot;, and refers to Diana&#x27;s guardianship over roadways, particularly Y-junctions or three-way crossroads. This role carried a somewhat dark and dangerous connotation, as it metaphorically pointed the way to the underworld. In the 1st-century CE play &quot;Medea&quot;, Seneca&#x27;s titular sorceress calls on Trivia to cast a magic spell. She evokes the triple goddess of Diana, Selene, and Hecate, and specifies that she requires the powers of the latter. The 1st century poet Horace similarly wrote of a magic incantation invoking the power of both Diana and Proserpina. The symbol of the crossroads is relevant to several aspects of Diana&#x27;s domain. It can symbolize the paths hunters may encounter in the forest, lit only by the full moon; this symbolizes making choices &quot;in the dark&quot; without the light of guidance.

Diana&#x27;s role as a goddess of the underworld, or at least of ushering people between life and death, caused her early on to be conflated with Hecate (and occasionally also with Proserpina). However, her role as an underworld goddess appears to pre-date strong Greek influence (though the early Greek colony of Cumae had a cult of Hekate and certainly had contacts with the Latins). A theater in her sanctuary at Lake Nemi included a pit and tunnel that would have allowed actors to easily descend on one side of the stage and ascend on the other, indicating a connection between the phases of the moon and a descent by the moon goddess into the underworld. It is likely that her underworld aspect in her original Latin worship did not have a distinct name, like Luna was for her moon aspect. This is due to a seeming reluctance or taboo by the early Latins to name underworld deities, and the fact that they believed the underworld to be silent, precluding naming. Hekate, a Greek goddess also associated with the boundary between the earth and the underworld, became attached to Diana as a name for her underworld aspect following Greek influence.

===As goddess of childbirth===
Diana was often considered to be a goddess associated with fertility and childbirth, and the protection of women during labor. This probably arose as an extension of her association with the moon, whose cycles were believed to parallel the menstrual cycle, and which was used to track the months during pregnancy. At her shrine in Aricia, worshipers left votive terracotta offerings for the goddess in the shapes of babies and wombs, and the temple there also offered care of pups and pregnant dogs. This care of infants also extended to the training of both young people and dogs, especially for hunting. In her role as a protector of childbirth, Diana was called &quot;Diana Lucina&quot;, &quot;Diana Lucifera&quot; or even &quot;Juno Lucina&quot;, because her domain overlapped with that of the goddess Juno. The title of Juno may also have had an independent origin as it applied to Diana, with the literal meaning of &quot;helper&quot; – Diana as &quot;Juno Lucina&quot; would be the &quot;helper of childbirth&quot;.

===As a &quot;frame god&quot;===

According to a theory proposed by Georges Dumézil, Diana falls into a particular subset of celestial gods, referred to in histories of religion as &quot;frame gods&quot;. Such gods, while keeping the original features of celestial divinities (i.e. transcendent heavenly power and abstention from direct rule in worldly matters), did not share the fate of other celestial gods in Indoeuropean religions – that of becoming &quot;dei otiosi&quot;, or gods without practical purpose, since they did retain a particular sort of influence over the world and mankind. The celestial character of Diana is reflected in her connection with inaccessibility, virginity, light, and her preference for dwelling on high mountains and in sacred woods. Diana, therefore, reflects the heavenly world in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, however, she is seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth. These functions are apparent in the traditional institutions and cults related to the goddess:
# The legend of the rex Nemorensis, Diana&#x27;s &quot;sacerdos&quot; (priest) in the Arician wood, who held the position until someone else challenged and killed him in a duel, after breaking a branch from a certain tree of the wood. This ever open succession reveals the character and mission of the goddess as a guarantor of kingly status through successive generations. Her function as bestower of authority to rule is also attested in the story related by Livy in which a Sabine man who sacrifices a heifer to Diana wins for his country the seat of the Roman empire.
# Diana was also worshiped by women who wanted to be pregnant or who, once pregnant, prayed for an easy delivery. This form of worship is attested in archaeological finds of votive statuettes in her sanctuary in the nemus Aricinum as well as in ancient sources, e.g. Ovid.

According to Dumezil, the forerunner of all &quot;frame gods&quot; is an Indian epic hero who was the image (avatar) of the Vedic god Dyaus. Having renounced the world, in his roles of father and king, he attained the status of an immortal being while retaining the duty of ensuring that his dynasty is preserved and that there is always a new king for each generation. The Scandinavian god Heimdallr performs an analogous function: he is born first and will die last. He too gives origin to kingship and the first king, bestowing on him regal prerogatives.
Diana, although a female deity, has exactly the same functions, preserving mankind through childbirth and royal succession.

F. H. Pairault, in her essay on Diana, qualified Dumézil&#x27;s theory as &quot;impossible to verify&quot;.

==Mythology==

Unlike the Greek gods, Roman gods were originally considered to be numina: divine powers of presence and will that did not necessarily have physical form. At the time Rome was founded, Diana and the other major Roman gods probably did not have much mythology per se, or any depictions in human form. The idea of gods as having anthropomorphic qualities and human-like personalities and actions developed later, under the influence of Greek and Etruscan religion.

By the 3rd century BCE, Diana is found listed among the twelve major gods of the Roman pantheon by the poet Ennius. Though the Capitoline Triad were the primary state gods of Rome, early Roman myth did not assign a strict hierarchy to the gods the way Greek mythology did, though the Greek hierarchy would eventually be adopted by Roman religion as well.

Once Greek influence had caused Diana to be considered identical to the Greek goddess Artemis, Diana acquired Artemis&#x27;s physical description, attributes, and variants of her myths as well. Like Artemis, Diana is usually depicted in art wearing a women&#x27;s chiton, shortened in the kolpos style to facilitate mobility during hunting, with a hunting bow and quiver, and often accompanied by hunting dogs. A 1st-century BCE Roman coin (see above) depicted her with a unique, short hairstyle, and in triple form, with one form holding a bow and another holding a poppy.

===Family===
When worship of Apollo was first introduced to Rome, Diana became conflated with Apollo&#x27;s sister Artemis as in the earlier Greek myths, and as such she became identified as the daughter of Apollo&#x27;s parents Latona and Jupiter. Though Diana was usually considered to be a virgin goddess like Artemis, later authors sometimes attributed consorts and children to her. According to Cicero and Ennius, Trivia (an epithet of Diana) and Caelus were the parents of Janus, as well as of Saturn and Ops.

According to Macrobius (who cited Nigidius Figulus and Cicero), Janus and Jana (Diana) are a pair of divinities, worshiped as the sun and moon. Janus was said to receive sacrifices before all the others because, through him, the way of access to the desired deity is made apparent.

===Myth of Actaeon===
Diana&#x27;s mythology incorporated stories which were variants of earlier stories about Artemis. Possibly the most well-known of these is the myth of Actaeon. In Ovid&#x27;s version of this myth, part of his poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, he tells of a pool or grotto hidden in the wooded valley of Gargaphie. There, Diana, the goddess of the woods, would bathe and rest after a hunt. Actaeon, a young hunter, stumbled across the grotto and accidentally witnessed the goddess bathing without invitation. In retaliation, Diana splashed him with water from the pool, cursing him, and he transformed into a deer. His own hunting dogs caught his scent, and tore him apart.

Ovid&#x27;s version of the myth of Actaeon differs from most earlier sources. Unlike earlier myths about Artemis, Actaeon is killed for an innocent mistake, glimpsing Diana bathing. An earlier variant of this myth, known as the Bath of Pallas, had the hunter intentionally spy on the bathing goddess Pallas (Athena), and earlier versions of the myth involving Artemis did not involve the bath at all.

==Worship in the classical period==

Diana was an ancient goddess common to all Latin tribes. Therefore, many sanctuaries were dedicated to her in the lands inhabited by Latins. Her primary sanctuary was a woodland grove overlooking Lake Nemi, a body of water also known as &quot;Diana&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, where she was worshiped as Diana Nemorensis, or &quot;Diana of the Wood&quot;. In Rome, the cult of Diana may have been almost as old as the city itself. Varro mentions her in the list of deities to whom king Titus Tatius promised to build a shrine. His list included Luna and Diana Lucina as separate entities. Another testimony to the antiquity of her cult is to be found in the &quot;lex regia&quot; of King Tullus Hostilius that condemns those guilty of incest to the &quot;sacratio&quot; to Diana. She had a temple in Rome on the Aventine Hill, according to tradition dedicated by king Servius Tullius. Its location is remarkable as the Aventine is situated outside the pomerium, i.e. original territory of the city, in order to comply with the tradition that Diana was a goddess common to all Latins and not exclusively of the Romans. Being placed on the Aventine, and thus outside the &quot;pomerium&quot;, meant that Diana&#x27;s cult essentially remained a &quot;foreign&quot; one, like that of Bacchus; she was never officially &quot;transferred&quot; to Rome as Juno was after the sack of Veii.

Other known sanctuaries and temples to Diana include Colle di Corne near Tusculum, where she is referred to with the archaic Latin name of &quot;deva Cornisca&quot; and where existed a collegium of worshippers; at Évora, Portugal; Mount Algidus, also near Tusculum; at Lavinium; and at Tibur (Tivoli), where she is referred to as &quot;Diana Opifera Nemorensis&quot;. Diana was also worshiped at a sacred wood mentioned by Livy – &quot;ad compitum Anagninum&quot; (near Anagni), and on Mount Tifata in Campania.

According to Plutarch, men and women alike were worshipers of Diana and were welcomed into all of her temples. The one exception seems to have been a temple on the Vicus Patricius, which men either did not enter due to tradition, or were not allowed to enter. Plutarch related a legend that a man had attempted to assault a woman worshiping in this temple and was killed by a pack of dogs (echoing the myth of Diana and Actaeon), which resulted in a superstition against men entering the temple.

A feature common to nearly all of Diana&#x27;s temples and shrines by the second century CE was the hanging up of stag antlers. Plutarch noted that the only exception to this was the temple on the Aventine Hill, in which bull horns had been hung up instead. Plutarch explains this by way of reference to a legend surrounding the sacrifice of an impressive Sabine bull by King Servius at the founding of the Aventine temple.

===Sanctuary at Lake Nemi===
Diana&#x27;s worship may have originated at an open-air sanctuary overlooking Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills near Aricia, where she was worshiped as Diana Nemorensis, or (&quot;Diana of the Sylvan Glade&quot;). According to legendary accounts, the sanctuary was founded by Orestes and Iphigenia after they fled from the Tauri. In this tradition, the Nemi sanctuary was supposedly built on the pattern of an earlier Temple of Artemis Tauropolos, and the first cult statue at Nemi was said to have been stolen from the Tauri and brought to Nemi by Orestes. Historical evidence suggests that worship of Diana at Nemi flourished from at least the 6th century BCE until the 2nd century CE. Her cult there was first attested in Latin literature by Cato the Elder, in a surviving quote by the late grammarian Priscian. By the 4th century BCE, the simple shrine at Nemi had been joined by a temple complex. The sanctuary served an important political role as it was held in common by the Latin League.

A festival to Diana, the Nemoralia, was held yearly at Nemi on the Ides of August (August 13–15). Worshipers traveled to Nemi carrying torches and garlands, and once at the lake, they left pieces of thread tied to fences and tablets inscribed with prayers. Diana&#x27;s festival eventually became widely celebrated throughout Italy, which was unusual given the provincial nature of Diana&#x27;s cult. The poet Statius wrote of the festival:
:&quot;It is the season when the most scorching region of the heavens takes over the land and the keen dog-star Sirius, so often struck by Hyperion&#x27;s sun, burns the gasping fields. Now is the day when Trivia&#x27;s Arician grove, convenient for fugitive kings, grows smoky, and the lake, having guilty knowledge of Hippolytus, glitters with the reflection of a multitude of torches; Diana herself garlands the deserving hunting dogs and polishes the arrowheads and allows the wild animals to go in safety, and at virtuous hearths all Italy celebrates the Hecatean Ides.&quot; (Statius &quot;Silv.&quot; 3.I.52–60)

Statius describes the triple nature of the goddess by invoking heavenly (the stars), earthly (the grove itself) and underworld (Hecate) imagery. He also suggests by the garlanding of the dogs and polishing of the spears that no hunting was allowed during the festival.

Legend has it that Diana&#x27;s high priest at Nemi, known as the Rex Nemorensis, was always an escaped slave who could only obtain the position by defeating his predecessor in a fight to the death. Sir James George Frazer wrote of this sacred grove in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, basing his interpretation on brief remarks in Strabo (5.3.12), Pausanias (2,27.24) and Servius&#x27; commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (6.136). The legend tells of a tree that stood in the center of the grove and was heavily guarded. No one was allowed to break off its limbs, with the exception of a runaway slave, who was allowed, if he could, to break off one of the boughs. He was then in turn granted the privilege to engage the Rex Nemorensis, the current king and priest of Diana, in a fight to the death. If the slave prevailed, he became the next king for as long as he could defeat his challengers. However, Joseph Fontenrose criticised Frazer&#x27;s assumption that a rite of this sort actually occurred at the sanctuary, and no contemporary records exist that support the historical existence of the &quot;Rex Nemorensis&quot;.

===Spread and conflation with Artemis===

Rome hoped to unify into and control the Latin tribes around Nemi, so Diana&#x27;s worship was imported to Rome as a show of political solidarity. Diana soon afterwards became Hellenized, and combined with the Greek goddess Artemis, &quot;a process which culminated with the appearance of Diana beside Apollo [the brother of Artemis] in the first &quot;lectisternium&quot; at Rome&quot; in 399 BCE. The process of identification between the two goddesses probably began when artists who were commissioned to create new religious statues for Diana&#x27;s temples outside Nemi were struck by the similar attributes between Diana and the more familiar Artemis, and sculpted Diana in a manner inspired by previous depictions of Artemis. Sibyllene influence and trade with Massilia, where similar cult statues of Artemis existed, would have completed the process.

According to Françoise Hélène Pairault&#x27;s study, historical and archaeological evidence point to the fact that the characteristics given to both Diana of the Aventine Hill and Diana Nemorensis were the product of the direct or indirect influence of the cult of Artemis, which was spread by the Phoceans among the Greek towns of Campania Cuma and Capua, who in turn had passed it over to the Etruscans and the Latins by the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.

Evidence suggests that a confrontation occurred between two groups of Etruscans who fought for supremacy, those from Tarquinia, Vulci and Caere (allied with the Greeks of Capua) and those of Clusium. This is reflected in the legend of the coming of Orestes to Nemi and of the inhumation of his bones in the Roman Forum near the temple of Saturn. The cult introduced by Orestes at Nemi is apparently that of the Artemis Tauropolos. The literary amplification reveals a confused religious background: different versions of Artemis were conflated under the epithet. As far as Nemi&#x27;s Diana is concerned there are two different versions, by Strabo and Servius Honoratus. Strabo&#x27;s version looks to be the most authoritative as he had access to first-hand primary sources on the sanctuaries of Artemis, i.e. the priest of Artemis Artemidoros of Ephesus. The meaning of &quot;Tauropolos&quot; denotes an Asiatic goddess with lunar attributes, lady of the herds. The only possible &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; of high antiquity concerning &quot;Diana Nemorensis&quot; could have been the one based on this ancient aspect of a deity of light, master of wildlife. &quot;Tauropolos&quot; is an ancient epithet attached to Artemis, Hecate, and even Athena. According to the legend Orestes founded Nemi together with Iphigenia. At Cuma the Sybil is the priestess of both Phoibos and Trivia. Hesiod and Stesichorus tell the story according to which after her death Iphigenia was divinised under the name of Hecate, a fact which would support the assumption that Artemis Tauropolos had a real ancient alliance with the heroine, who was her priestess in Taurid and her human paragon. This religious complex is in turn supported by the triple statue of Artemis-Hecate.

In Rome, Diana was regarded with great reverence and was a patroness of lower-class citizens, called plebeians, as well as slaves, who could receive asylum in her temples. Georg Wissowa proposed that this might be because the first slaves of the Romans were Latins of the neighboring tribes. However, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus had the same custom of the asylum.

===In Rome===

Worship of Diana probably spread into the city of Rome beginning around 550 BCE, during her Hellenization and combination with the Greek goddess Artemis. Diana was first worshiped along with her brother and mother, Apollo and Latona, in their temple in the Campus Martius, and later in the Temple of Apollo Palatinus.

The first major temple dedicated primarily to Diana in the vicinity of Rome was the Temple of Diana Aventina (Diana of the Aventine Hill). According to the Roman historian Livy, the construction of this temple began in the 6th century BCE and was inspired by stories of the massive Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, which was said to have been built through the combined efforts of all the cities of Asia Minor. Legend has it that Servius Tullius was impressed with this act of massive political and economic cooperation, and convinced the cities of the Latin League to work with the Romans to build their own temple to the goddess. However, there is no compelling evidence for such an early construction of the temple, and it is more likely that it was built in the 3rd century BCE, following the influence of the temple at Nemi, and probably about the same time the first temples to Vertumnus (who was associated with Diana) were built in Rome (264 BCE). The misconception that the Aventine Temple was inspired by the Ephesian Temple might originate in the fact that the cult images and statues used at the former were based heavily on those found in the latter. Whatever its initial construction date, records show that the Avantine Temple was rebuilt by Lucius Cornificius in 32 BCE. If it was still in use by the 4th century CE, the Aventine temple would have been permanently closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Today, a short street named the &quot;Via del Tempio di Diana&quot; and an associated plaza, &quot;Piazza del Tempio di Diana&quot;, commemorates the site of the temple. Part of its wall is located within one of the halls of the Apuleius restaurant.

Later temple dedications often were based on the model for ritual formulas and regulations of the Temple of Diana. Roman politicians built several minor temples to Diana elsewhere in Rome to secure public support. One of these was built in the Campus Martius in 187 BCE; no Imperial period records of this temple have been found, and it is possible it was one of the temples demolished around 55 BCE in order to build a theater. Diana also had a public temple on the Quirinal Hill, the sanctuary of Diana Planciana. It was dedicated by Plancius in 55 BCE, though it is unclear which Plancius.

In their worship of Artemis, Greeks filled their temples with sculptures of the goddess created by well-known sculptors, and many were adapted for use in the worship of Diana by the Romans, beginning around the 2nd century BCE (the beginning of a period of strong Hellenistic influence on Roman religion). The earliest depictions of the Artemis of Ephesus are found on Ephesian coins from this period. By the Imperial period, small marble statues of the Ephesian Artemis were being produced in the Western region of the Mediterranean and were often bought by Roman patrons. The Romans obtained a large copy of an Ephesian Artemis statue for their temple on the Aventine Hill. Diana was usually depicted for educated Romans in her Greek guise. If she was shown accompanied by a deer, as in the &quot;Diana of Versailles&quot;, this is because Diana was the patroness of hunting. The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of Acteon (or Actaeon), who saw her bathing naked. Diana transformed Acteon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to kill him.

===At Mount Tifata===

In Campania, Diana had a major temple at Mount Tifata, near Capua. She was worshiped there as &quot;Diana Tifatina&quot;. This was one of the oldest sanctuaries in Campania. As a rural sanctuary, it included lands and estates that would have been worked by slaves following the Roman conquest of Campania, and records show that expansion and renovation projects at her temple were funded in part by other conquests by Roman military campaigns. The modern Christian church of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Formis was built on the ruins of the Tifata temple.

===Roman provinces===
In the Roman provinces, Diana was widely worshiped alongside local deities. Over 100 inscriptions to Diana have been cataloged in the provinces, mainly from Gaul, Upper Germania, and Britannia. Diana was commonly invoked alongside another forest god, Silvanus, as well as other &quot;mountain gods&quot;. In the provinces, she was occasionally conflated with local goddesses such as Abnoba, and was given high status, with &quot;Augusta&quot; and &quot;regina&quot; (&quot;queen&quot;) being common epithets.

===Household worship===
Diana was not only regarded as a goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, but was often worshiped as a patroness of families. She served a similar function to the hearth goddess Vesta, and was sometimes considered to be a member of the Penates, the deities most often invoked in household rituals. In this role, she was often given a name reflecting the tribe of family who worshiped her and asked for her protection. For example, in what is now Wiesbaden, Diana was worshiped as &quot;Diana Mattiaca&quot; by the Mattiaci tribe. Other family-derived named attested in the ancient literature include &quot;Diana Cariciana&quot;, &quot;Diana Valeriana&quot;, and &quot;Diana Plancia&quot;. As a house goddess, Diana often became reduced in stature compared to her official worship by the Roman state religion. In personal or family worship, Diana was brought to the level of other household spirits, and was believed to have a vested interest in the prosperity of the household and the continuation of the family. The Roman poet Horace regarded Diana as a household goddess in his &quot;Odes&quot;, and had an altar dedicated to her in his villa where household worship could be conducted. In his poetry, Horace deliberately contrasted the kinds of grand, elevated hymns to Diana on behalf of the entire Roman state, the kind of worship that would have been typical at her Aventine temple, with a more personal form of devotion.

Images of Diana and her associated myths have been found on sarcophagi of wealthy Romans. They often included scenes depicting sacrifices to the goddess, and on at least one example, the deceased man is shown joining Diana&#x27;s hunt.

==Theology==
Since ancient times, philosophers and theologians have examined the nature of Diana in light of her worship traditions, attributes, mythology, and identification with other gods.

===Conflation with other goddesses===

Diana was initially a hunting goddess and goddess of the local woodland at Nemi, but as her worship spread, she acquired attributes of other similar goddesses. As she became conflated with Artemis, she became a moon goddess, identified with the other lunar goddesses goddess Luna and Hekate. She also became the goddess of childbirth and ruled over the countryside. Catullus wrote a poem to Diana in which she has more than one alias: Latonia, Lucina, Juno, Trivia, Luna.

Along with Mars, Diana was often venerated at games held in Roman amphitheaters, and some inscriptions from the Danubian provinces show that she was conflated with Nemesis in this role, as &quot;Diana Nemesis&quot;.

Outside of Italy, Diana had important centers of worship where she was syncretised with similar local deities in Gaul, Upper Germania, and Britannia. Diana was particularly important in the region in and around the Black Forest, where she was conflated with the local goddess Abnoba and worshiped as &quot;Diana Abnoba&quot;.

Some late antique sources went even further, syncretizing many local &quot;great goddesses&quot; into a single &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;. The Platonist philosopher Apuleius, writing in the late 2nd century, depicted the goddess declaring:
&quot;I come, Lucius, moved by your entreaties: I, mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, first-born of the ages, highest of the gods, queen of the shades, first of those who dwell in heaven, representing in one shape all gods and goddesses. My will controls the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving sea-winds, and the mournful silences of hell; the entire world worships my single godhead in a thousand shapes, with divers rites, and under many a different name. The Phrygians, first-born of mankind, call me the Pessinuntian Mother of the gods; the native Athenians the Cecropian Minerva; the island-dwelling Cypriots Paphian Venus; the archer Cretans Dictynnan Diana; the triple-tongued Sicilians Stygian Proserpine; the ancient Eleusinians Actaean Ceres; some call me Juno, some Bellona, others Hecate, others Rhamnusia; but both races of Ethiopians, those on whom the rising and those on whom the setting sun shines, and the Egyptians who excel in ancient learning, honour me with the worship which is truly mine and call me by my true name: Queen Isis.&quot;
:--Apuleius, translated by E. J. Kenny. &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;

Later poets and historians looked to Diana&#x27;s identity as a triple goddess to merge her with triads heavenly, earthly, and underworld (cthonic) goddesses. Maurus Servius Honoratus said that the same goddess was called Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpina in hell. Michael Drayton praises the Triple Diana in poem &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; (1606): &quot;So these great three most powerful of the rest, Phoebe, Diana, Hecate, do tell. Her sovereignty in Heaven, in Earth and Hell&quot;.

===In Platonism===
Based on the earlier writings of Plato, the Neoplatonist philosophers of late antiquity united the various major gods of Hellenic tradition into a series of monads containing within them triads, with some creating the world, some animating it or bringing it to life, and others harmonizing it. Within this system, Proclus considered Diana to be one of the primary animating, or life-giving, deities. Proclus, citing Orphic tradition, concludes that Diana &quot;presides over all the generation in nature, and is the midwife of physical productive principles&quot; and that she &quot;extends these genitals, distributing as far as to subterranean natures the prolific power of [Bacchus].&quot; Specifically, Proclus considered the life-generating principle of the highest order, within the Intellectual realm, to be Rhea, whom he identified with Ceres. Within her divinity was produced the cause of the basic principle of life. Projecting this principle into the lower, Hypercosmic realm of reality generated a lower monad, Kore, who could therefore be understood as Ceres&#x27; &quot;daughter&quot;. Kore embodied the &quot;maidenly&quot; principle of generation that, more importantly, included a principle of division – where Demeter generates life indiscriminately, Kore distributes it individually. This division results in another triad or trinity, known as the Maidenly trinity, within the monad of Kore: namely, Diana, Proserpine, and Minerva, through whom individual living beings are given life and perfected. Specifically, according to a commentary by scholar Spyridon Rangos, Diana (equated with Hecate) gives existence, Proserpine (equated with &quot;Soul&quot;) gives form, and Minerva (equated with &quot;Virtue&quot;) gives intellect.

In his commentary on Proclus, the 19th century Platonist scholar Thomas Taylor expanded upon the theology of the classical philosophers, further interpreting the nature and roles of the gods in light of the whole body of Neoplatonist philosophy. He cites Plato in giving a three-form aspect to her central characteristic of virginity: the undefiled, the mundane, and the anagogic. Through the first form, Diana is regarded as a &quot;lover of virginity&quot;. Through the second, she is the guardian of virtue. Through the third, she is considered to &quot;hate the impulses arising from generation.&quot; Through the principle of the undefiled, Taylor suggests that she is given supremacy in Proclus&#x27; triad of life-giving or animating deities, and in this role the theurgists called her Hekate. In this role, Diana is granted undefiled power (&quot;Amilieti&quot;) from the other gods. This generative power does not proceed forth from the goddess (according to a statement by the Oracle of Delphi) but rather resides with her, giving her unparalleled virtue, and in this way she can be said to embody virginity. Later commentators on Proclus have clarified that the virginity of Diana is not an absence of sexual drive, but a renunciation of sexuality. Diana embodies virginity because she generates but precedes active fertility (within Neoplatonism, an important maxim is that &quot;every productive cause is superior to the nature of the produced effect&quot;).

Using the ancient Neoplatonists as a basis, Taylor also commented on the triadic nature of Diana and related goddesses, and the ways in which they subsist within one another, partaking unevenly in each other&#x27;s powers and attributes. For example, Kore is said to embody both Diana/Hecate and Minerva, who create the virtuous or virgin power within her, but also Proserpine (her sole traditional identification), through whom the generative power of the Kore as a whole is able to proceed forth into the world, where it joins with the demiurge to produce further deities, including Bacchus and &quot;nine azure-eyed, flower-producing daughters&quot;.

Proclus also included Artemis/Diana in a second triad of deities, along with Ceres and Juno. According to Proclus:
:&quot;The life-generating triad begins with Demeter who engenders the entire encosmic life, namely intellectual life, psychic life and the life that is inseparable from body; Hera who brings forth the birth of soul occupies the cohering middle position (for the intellectual goddess outpours from herself all the processions of the psychic kinds); finally, Artemis has been assigned to the end of the trinity because she activates all the natural formative principles and perfects the self-completeness of matter; it is for this reason, namely because she supervises natural development and natural birth, that the theologians and Socrates in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; call her Lochia.&quot;

Proclus pointed to the conflict between Hera and Artemis in the &quot;Illiad&quot; as a representation of the two kinds of human souls. Where Hera creates the higher, more cultured, or &quot;worthy&quot; souls, Artemis brings light to and perfects the &quot;less worthy&quot; or less rational. As explained by Ragnos (2000), &quot;The aspect of reality which Artemis and Hera share, and because of which they engage in a symbolic conflict, is the engendering of life.&quot; Hera elevates rational living beings up to intellectual rational existence, whereas Artemis&#x27;s power pertains to human life as far as its physical existence as a living thing. &quot;Artemis deals with the most elementary forms of life or the most elementary part of all life, whereas Hera operates in the most elevated forms of life or the most elevated part of all life.

==Worship in post-Roman Europe==

Sermons and other religious documents have provided evidence for the worship of Diana during the Middle Ages. Though few details have been recorded, enough references to Diana worship during the early Christian period exist to give some indication that it may have been relatively widespread among remote and rural communities throughout Europe, and that such beliefs persisted into the Merovingian period. References to contemporary Diana worship exist from the 6th century on the Iberian peninsula and what is now southern France, though more detailed accounts of Dianic cults were given for the Low Countries, and southern Belgium in particular. Many of these were probably local goddesses, and wood nymphs or dryads, which had been conflated with Diana by Christian writers Latinizing local names and traditions.

===In the Low Countries===
The 6th century bishop Gregory of Tours reported meeting with a deacon named Vulfilaic (also known as Saint Wulflaicus or Walfroy the Stylite), who founded a hermitage on a hill in what is now Margut, France. On the same hill, he found &quot;an image of Diana which the unbelieving people worshiped as a god.&quot; According to Gregory&#x27;s report, worshipers would also sing chants in Diana&#x27;s honor as they drank and feasted. Vulfilaic destroyed a number of smaller pagan statues in the area, but the statue of Diana was too large. After converting some of the local population to Christianity, Vulfilaic and a group of local residents attempted to pull the large statue down the mountain in order to destroy it, but failed, as it was too large to be moved. In Vulfilaic&#x27;s account, after praying for a miracle, he was then able to single-handedly pull down the statue, at which point he and his group smashed it to dust with their hammers. According to Vulfilaic, this incident was quickly followed by an outbreak of pimples or sores that covered his entire body, which he attributed to demonic activity and similarly cured via what he described as a miracle. Vulfilaic would later found a church on the site, which is today known as Mont Saint-Walfroy.

Additional evidence for surviving pagan practices in the Low Countries region comes from the &quot;Vita Eligii&quot;, or &quot;Life of Saint Eligius&quot;, written by Audoin in the 7th century. Audoin drew together the familiar admonitions of Eligius to the people of Flanders. In his sermons, he denounced &quot;pagan customs&quot; that the people continued to follow. In particular, he denounced several Roman gods and goddesses alongside Druidic mythological beliefs and objects:

&quot;I denounce and contest, that you shall observe no sacrilegious pagan customs. For no cause or infirmity should you consult magicians, diviners, sorcerers or incantators. ..Do not observe auguries ... No influence attaches to the first work of the day or the [phase of the] moon. ... [Do not] make vetulas, little deer or iotticos or set tables at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks... No Christian... performs solestitia or dancing or leaping or diabolical chants. No Christian should presume to invoke the name of a demon, not Neptune or Orcus or Diana or Minerva or Geniscus... No one should observe Jove&#x27;s day in idleness. ... No Christian should make or render any devotion to the gods of the trivium, where three roads meet, to the fanes or the rocks, or springs or groves or corners. None should presume to hang any phylacteries from the neck of man nor beast. ..None should presume to make lustrations or incantations with herbs, or to pass cattle through a hollow tree or ditch ... No woman should presume to hang amber from her neck or call upon Minerva or other ill-starred beings in their weaving or dyeing. ... None should call the sun or moon lord or swear by them. ... No one should tell fate or fortune or horoscopes by them as those do who believe that a person must be what he was born to be.&quot;

Legends from medieval Belgium concern a natural spring which came to be known as the &quot;Fons Remacli&quot;, a location which may have been home to late-surviving worship of Diana. Remacle was a monk appointed by Eligius to head a monastery at Solignac, and he is reported to have encountered Diana worship in the area around the river Warche. The population in this region was said to have been involved in the worship of &quot;Diana of the Ardennes&quot; (a syncretism of Diana and the Celtic goddess Arduinna), with effigies and &quot;stones of Diana&quot; used as evidence of pagan practices. Remacle believed that demonic entities were present in the spring, and had caused it to run dry. He performed and exorcism of the water source, and installed a lead pipe, which allowed the water to flow again.

===The &quot;Society of Diana&quot;===
Diana is the only pagan goddess mentioned by name in the New Testament (only in some Bible versions of Acts 19; many other Bibles refer to her as Artemis instead). As a result, she became associated with many folk beliefs involving goddess-like supernatural figures that Catholic clergy wished to demonize. In the Middle Ages, legends of night-time processions of spirits led by a female figure are recorded in the church records of Northern Italy, western Germany, and southern France. The spirits were said to enter houses and consume food which then miraculously re-appeared. They would sing and dance, and dispense advice regarding healing herbs and the whereabouts of lost objects. If the house was in good order, they would bring fertility and plenty. If not, they would bring curses to the family. Some women reported participating in these processions while their bodies still lay in bed. Historian Carlo Ginzburg has referred to these legendary spirit gatherings as &quot;The Society of Diana&quot;.

Local clergy complained that women believed they were following Diana or Herodias, riding out on appointed nights to join the processions or carry out instructions from the goddess. The earliest reports of these legends appear in the writings of Regino of Prüm in the year 899, followed by many additional reports and variants of the legend in documents by Ratherius and others. By 1310, the names of the goddess figures attached to the legend were sometimes combined as Herodiana. It is likely that the clergy of this time used the identification of the procession&#x27;s leader as Diana or Herodias in order to fit an older folk belief into a Biblical framework, as both are featured and demonized in the New Testament. Herodias was often conflated with her daughter Salome in legend, which also holds that, upon being presented with the severed head of John the Baptist, she was blown into the air by wind from the saint&#x27;s mouth, through which she continued to wander for eternity. Diana was often conflated with Hecate, a goddess associated with the spirits of the dead and with witchcraft. These associations, and the fact that both figures are attested to in the Bible, made them a natural fit for the leader of the ghostly procession. Clergy used this identification to assert that the spirits were evil, and that the women who followed them were inspired by demons. As was typical of this time period, though pagan beliefs and practices were near eliminated from Europe, the clergy and other authorities still treated paganism as a real threat, in part thanks to biblical influence; much of the Bible had been written when various forms of paganism were still active if not dominant, so medieval clergy applied the same kinds of warnings and admonitions for any non-standard folk beliefs and practices they encountered. Based on analysis of church documents and parishioner confessions, it is likely that the spirit identified by the Church as Diana or Herodias was called by names of pre-Christian figures like Holda (a Germanic goddess of the winter solstice), or with names referencing her bringing of prosperity, like the Latin Abundia (meaning &quot;plenty&quot;), Satia (meaning &quot;full&quot; or &quot;plentiful&quot;) and the Italian Richella (meaning &quot;rich&quot;). Some of the local titles for her, such as &quot;bonae res&quot; (meaning &quot;good things&quot;), are similar to late classical titles for Hecate, like &quot;bona dea&quot;. This might indicate a cultural mixture of medieval folk ideas with holdovers from earlier pagan belief systems. Whatever her true origin, by the 13th century, the leader of the legendary spirit procession had come to be firmly identified with Diana and Herodias through the influence of the Church.

==Modern development and folklore==
===&quot;The Golden Bough&quot;===

In his wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, anthropologist James George Frazer drew on various lines of evidence to re-interpret the legendary rituals associated with Diana at Nemi, particularly that of the &quot;rex Nemorensis&quot;. Frazer developed his ideas in relation to J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s painting, also titled &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, depicting a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of Nemi. According to Frazer, the &quot;rex Nemorensis&quot; or king at Nemi was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who participated in a mystical marriage to a goddess. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claimed that this motif of death and rebirth is central to nearly all of the world&#x27;s religions and mythologies. In Frazer&#x27;s theory, Diana functioned as a goddess of fertility and childbirth, who, assisted by the sacred king, ritually returned life to the land in spring. The king in this scheme served not only as a high priest but as a god of the grove. Frazer identifies this figure with Virbius, of which little is known, but also with Jupiter via an association with sacred oak trees. Frazer argued furthermore that Jupiter and Juno were simply duplicate names of Jana and Janus; that is, Diana and Dianus, all of whom had identical functions and origins.

Frazer&#x27;s speculatively reconstructed folklore of Diana&#x27;s origins and the nature of her cult at Nemi were not well received even by his contemporaries. Godfrey Lienhardt noted that even during Frazer&#x27;s lifetime, other anthropologists had &quot;for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions&quot;, and that the lasting influence of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and Frazer&#x27;s wider body of work &quot;has been in the literary rather than the academic world.&quot; Robert Ackerman wrote that, for anthropologists, Frazer is &quot;an embarrassment&quot; for being &quot;the most famous of them all&quot; and that most distance themselves from his work. While &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; achieved wide &quot;popular appeal&quot; and exerted a &quot;disproportionate&quot; influence &quot;on so many [20th century] creative writers&quot;, Frazer&#x27;s ideas played &quot;a much smaller part&quot; in the history of academic social anthropology.

===&quot;The Gospel of the Witches&quot;===

Folk legends like the Society of Diana, which linked the goddess to forbidden gatherings of women with spirits, may have influenced later works of folklore. One of these is Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, which prominently featured Diana at the center of an Italian witch-cult. In Leland&#x27;s interpretation of supposed Italian folk witchcraft, Diana is considered Queen of the Witches. In this belief system, Diana is said to have created the world of her own being having in herself the seeds of all creation yet to come. It was said that out of herself she divided the darkness and the light, keeping for herself the darkness of creation and creating her brother Lucifer. Diana was believed to have loved and ruled with her brother, and with him bore a daughter, Aradia (a name likely derived from Herodias), who leads and teaches the witches on earth.

Leland&#x27;s claim that &quot;Aradia&quot; represented an authentic tradition from an underground witch-cult, which had secretly worshiped Diana since ancient times has been dismissed by most scholars of folklore, religion, and medieval history. After the 1921 publication of Margaret Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Witch-cult in Western Europe&quot;, which hypothesized that the European witch trials were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival, American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon&#x27;s 1929 book &quot;Witches Still Live&quot; connected Murray&#x27;s thesis with the witchcraft religion in &quot;Aradia&quot;. Arguments against Murray&#x27;s thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar Jeffrey Russell devoted some of his 1980 book &quot;A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans&quot; to arguing against the claims Leland presented in &quot;Aradia&quot;. Historian Elliot Rose&#x27;s &quot;A Razor for a Goat&quot; dismissed &quot;Aradia&quot; as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion. In his book &quot;Triumph of the Moon&quot;, historian Ronald Hutton doubted not only of the existence of the religion that &quot;Aradia&quot; claimed to represent, and that the traditions Leland presented were unlike anything found in actual medieval literature, but also of the existence of Leland&#x27;s sources, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily &quot;duped&quot;. Religious scholar Chas S. Clifton took exception to Hutton&#x27;s position, writing that it amounted to an accusation of &quot;serious literary fraud&quot; made by an &quot;argument from absence&quot;.

===Modern worship===
Because Leland&#x27;s claims about an Italian witch-cult are questionable, the first verifiable worship of Diana in the modern age was probably begun by Wicca. The earliest known practitioners of Neopagan witchcraft were members of a tradition begun by Gerald Gardner. Published versions of the devotional materials used by Gardner&#x27;s group, dated to 1949, are heavily focused on the worship of Aradia, the daughter of Diana in Leland&#x27;s folklore. Diana herself was recognized as an aspect of a single &quot;great goddess&quot; in the tradition of Apuleius, as described in the Wiccan Charge of the Goddess (itself adapted from Leland&#x27;s text). Some later Wiccans, such as Scott Cunningham, would replace Aradia with Diana as the central focus of worship.

In the early 1960s, Victor Henry Anderson founded the Feri Tradition, a form of Wicca that draws from both Charles Leland&#x27;s folklore and the Gardnerian tradition. Anderson claimed that he had first been initiated into a witchcraft tradition as a child in 1926, and that he had been told the name of the goddess worshiped by witches was Tana. The name Tana originated in Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia&quot;, where he claimed it was an old Etruscan name for Diana. The Feri Tradition founded by Anderson continues to recognize Tana/Diana as an aspect of the Star Goddess related to the element of fire, and representing &quot;the fiery womb that gives birth to and transforms all matter.&quot; (In &quot;Aradia&quot;, Diana is also credited as the creatrix of the material world and Queen of Faeries).

A few Wiccan traditions would elevate Diana to a more prominent position of worship, and there are two distinct modern branches of Wicca focused primarily on Diana. The first, founded during the early 1970s in the United States by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts, has a feminist theology and only occasionally accepts male participants, and leadership is limited to female priestesses. McFarland Dianic Wiccans base their tradition primarily on the work of Robert Graves and his book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, and were inspired by references to the existence of medieval European &quot;Dianic cults&quot; in Margaret Murray&#x27;s book &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot;. The second Dianic tradition, founded by Zsuzsanna Budapest in the mid-1970s, is characterized by an exclusive focus on the feminine aspect of the divine, and as a result is exclusively female. This tradition combines elements from British Traditional Wicca, Italian folk-magic based on the work of Charles Leland, feminist values, and healing practices drawn from a variety of different cultures.

A third Neopagan tradition heavily inspired by the worship of Diana through the lens of Italian folklore is Stregheria, founded in the 1980s. It centers around a pair of deities regarded as divine lovers, who are known by several variant names including Diana and Dianus, alternately given as Tana and Tanus or Jana and Janus (the later two deity names were mentioned by James Frazer in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; as later corruptions of Diana and Dianus, which themselves were alternate and possibly older names for Juno and Jupiter). The tradition was founded by author Raven Grimassi, and influenced by Italian folktales he was told by his mother. One such folktale describes the moon being impregnated by her lover the morning star, a parallel to Leland&#x27;s mythology of Diana and her lover Lucifer.

Diana was also a subject of worship in certain Feraferian rites, particularly those surrounding the autumnal equinox, beginning in 1967.

===In language===
Both the Romanian words for &quot;fairy&quot; and Sânziană, the Leonese and Portuguese word for &quot;water nymph&quot; &quot;xana&quot;, and the Spanish word for &quot;shooting target&quot; and &quot;morning call&quot; () seem to come from the name of Diana.

===In the arts===
Since the Renaissance, Diana&#x27;s myths have often been represented in the visual and dramatic arts, including the opera &quot;L&#x27;arbore di Diana&quot;. In the 16th century, Diana&#x27;s image figured prominently at the châteaus of Fontainebleau, Chenonceau, and at Anet, in deference to Diane de Poitiers, mistress of Henri of France. At Versailles she was incorporated into the Olympian iconography with which Louis XIV, the Apollo-like &quot;Sun King&quot; liked to surround himself. Diana is also a character in the 1876 Léo Delibes ballet &quot;Sylvia&quot;. The plot deals with Sylvia, one of Diana&#x27;s nymphs and sworn to chastity, and Diana&#x27;s assault on Sylvia&#x27;s affections for the shepherd Amyntas.

====In literature====
* Diana Soren, the main character in Carlos Fuentes&#x27; novel &quot;Diana o la cazadora soltera&quot; (&quot;Diana, or The Lone Huntress&quot;), is described as having the same personality as the goddess.
* In Jonathan Swift&#x27;s poem: &quot;The Progress of Beauty&quot;, as goddess of the moon, Diana is used in comparison to the 17th/early 18th century everyday woman Swift satirically writes about. Starts: &#x27;When first Diana leaves her bed...&#x27;
* In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), Diana leads the Trojan Brutus to Britain, where he and his people settle.
* The character of Diana is the principal character in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon Stallion&quot; by Brian Hayles (1978) and the BBC Television series of the same name &quot;Diana&quot; is played by the actress Sarah Sutton.
* In Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Camp Half-Blood Chronicles&quot;, Diana acts as the Roman incarnation of Artemis, although she does not appear until &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Tomb&quot;. Throughout &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot;, along with the other gods, Artemis is split between her Greek and Roman incarnations. In &quot;The Tyrant&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, Apollo summons his sister for help against Tarquin and his undead army. Diana appears with the Hunters of Artemis to slay Tarquin and his army and she heals Apollo&#x27;s wounds before departing again.
;In Shakespeare

* In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; Diana appears to Pericles in a vision, telling him to go to her temple and tell his story to her followers.
* In &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; Diana appears as a figure in the play and Helena makes multiple allusions to her, such as, &quot;Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly...&quot; and &quot;...wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian/was both herself and love...&quot; The Steward also says, &quot;...; Dian no queen of virgins,/ that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without/ rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.&quot; It can be assumed that &#x27;Dian&#x27; is simply a shortening of &#x27;Diana&#x27; since later in the play when Parolles&#x27; letter to Diana is read aloud it reads &#x27;Dian&#x27;.
;In games and comics
* The character of Diana from the video game &quot;League of Legends&quot; is largely based on the goddess.
* William Moulton Marston drew from the Diana archetype as an allegorical basis for Wonder Woman&#x27;s proper name, Princess Diana for DC Comics. Most versions of Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin story state that she is given the name Diana because her mother Hippolyta was inspired by the goddess of the moon that Diana was born under.
* Diana also is one of the primary gods in the video game &quot;Ryse&quot;.
* In the manga and anime series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, Diana is the feline companion to Chibiusa, Usagi&#x27;s daughter. Diana is the daughter of Artemis and Luna. All of these characters are advisers to rulers of the kingdom of the moon and therefore have moon-associated names.

====In painting and sculpture====


Diana has been one of the most popular themes in art. Painters like Titian, Peter Paul Rubens, François Boucher, Nicolas Poussin and made use of her myth as a major theme. Most depictions of Diana in art featured the stories of Diana and Actaeon, or Callisto, or depicted her resting after hunting. Some famous work of arts with a Diana theme are:
* &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot;, &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;, and &quot;Death of Actaeon&quot; by Titian.
* &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;, &quot;Diana Returning from the Hunt&quot;, &quot;Diana Resting After a Bath&quot;, and &quot;Diana Getting Out of Bath&quot; by François Boucher.
* &quot;Diana Bathing With Her Nymphs&quot; by Rembrandt.
* &quot;Diana and Endymion&quot; by Poussin.
* &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;, &quot;Diana and Her Nymph Departing From Hunt&quot;, &quot;Diana and Her Nymphs Surprised By A Faun&quot; by Rubens.
* &quot;Diana and Endymion&quot; by Johann Michael Rottmayr.
* &quot;Diana Wounded&quot;, bronze statue by Sir Edgar Bertram Mackennal, housed in Tate Gallery of London (purchased 1908).
* The famous fountain at Palace of Caserta, Italy, created by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari, depicting Diana being surprised by Acteon.
* A sculpture by Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain can be seen at the Musée du Louvre.
* &quot;Diana of the Tower&quot; a copper statue by Augustus Saint-Gaudens was created as the weather vane for the second Madison Square Garden in 1893. It now is on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art
* A sculpture by French sculptor François-Léon Sicard in the Archibald Fountain, Sydney, NSW, Australia 
* In Parma at the convent of San Paolo, Antonio Allegri da Correggio painted the chamber of the Abbess Giovanna Piacenza&#x27;s apartment. He was commissioned in 1519 to paint the ceiling and mantel of the fireplace. On the mantel he painted an image of Diana riding in a chariot possibly pulled by a stag.
* &quot;Fuente de la Diana Cazadora&quot; [Fountain of the Huntress Diana], a fountain sculpture of huntress Diana with arrow pointing skyward, stands in the roundabout at Paseo de la Reforma, Zona Rosa, Mexico City&#x27;s Mexican Federal District.
* &quot;Diana of the Chase&quot;, a bronze statue by Anna Hyatt Huntington in 1922. &quot;Diana&quot; was a defining symbol at the time, placed at institutions, such as the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, the New York Historical Society in New York City, and the Huntington Art Gallery in San Marino, California. One of the most notable of replicas can be found at Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, which was founded by Anna Hyatt Huntington and her husband Archer Milton Huntington in 1932.
* Beaux Arts architecture and garden design (late 19th and early 20th centuries) used classic references in a modernized form. Two of the most popular of the period were of Pomona (goddess of orchards) as a metaphor for Agriculture, and Diana, representing Commerce, which is a perpetual hunt for advantage and profits.

There are many statues of Diana the Huntress in Yambol, Bulgaria.

====In film====
*In Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, it is Diana&#x27;s power which has transformed and imprisoned the beast.
*Diana/Artemis appears at the end of the &#x27;Pastoral Symphony&#x27; segment of &quot;Fantasia&quot;.
*In his 1968 film &quot;La Mariée était en noir&quot; François Truffaut plays on this mythological symbol. Julie Kohler, played by Jeanne Moreau, poses as Diana/Artemis for the artist Fergus. This choice seems fitting for Julie, a character beset by revenge, of which Fergus becomes the fourth victim. She poses with a bow and arrow, while wearing white.
* In the 1995 comedy &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, a coven of witches resurrects a petrified Diana on New Year&#x27;s Eve.
* French based collective LFKs and his film/theatre director, writer and visual artist Jean Michel Bruyere produced a series of 600 shorts and &quot;medium&quot; film, an interactive audiovisual 360° installation (&quot;Si poteris narrare licet&quot; (&quot;if you are able to speak of it, then you may do so&quot; ... ) in 2002, and a 3D 360° audiovisual installation &quot;La Dispersion du Fils&quot; from 2008 to 2016 as well as an outdoor performance, &quot;Une Brutalité pastorale&quot; (2000), all about the myth of Diana and Actaeon.

==== In music ====
* Diana is a character in &quot;Hippolytus and Aricia&quot;, an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau.
* For the album art of progressive metal band Protest the Hero&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Fortress&quot;, Diana is depicted protected by rams and other animals. The theme of Diana is carried throughout the album.
* The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg wrote a mass for mixed choir in seven parts after a selection of poems from Leland&#x27;s text &quot;Aradia&quot;, in which Diana features heavily. The &quot;Witch Mass&quot; was premiered at the Vestfold International Festival in 2012 with Grex Vocalis. In order to create the right atmosphere for the music, the festival blocked of an entire road tunnel in Tønsberg to use it as a venue. The work was released on CD through Lawo Classics in 2014.
* Artemis, and subsequently Diana, is used as focal point in &quot;Artemis&quot;, track twelve of AURORA&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;The Gods We Can Touch&quot;

===Other===
*In the funeral oration of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, her brother drew an analogy between the ancient goddess of hunting and his sister – &quot;the most hunted person of the modern age&quot;.
*DIANA Mayer &amp; Grammelspacher GmbH &amp; Co.KG, an airgun company, is named after Diana, the goddess of hunting.
* The Royal Netherlands Air Force 323rd Squadron is named Diana and uses a depiction of Diana with her bow in its badge.
* In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico a woman calling herself &quot;Diana Huntress of Bus Drivers&quot; was responsible for the shooting of two bus drivers in 2013 in what may have been vigilante attacks.
*Diana is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of coral snake, &quot;Micrurus diana&quot;.

<text>Daniel Robert Elfman (born May 29, 1953) is an American film composer, singer, songwriter, and musician. He came to prominence as the lead vocalist and primary songwriter for the new wave band Oingo Boingo in the early 1980s. Since scoring his first studio film in 1985, Elfman has garnered international recognition for composing over 100 feature film scores, as well as compositions for television, stage productions, and the concert hall.

Elfman has frequently worked with directors Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, and Gus Van Sant, contributing music to nearly 20 Burton projects, including &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Big Fish&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, as well as scoring Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Darkman&quot;, &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, and Van Sant&#x27;s Academy Award-winning films &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;Milk&quot;. He wrote music for all of the &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; franchise films, the songs and score for Henry Selick&#x27;s animated musical &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and the themes for the popular television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Among his honors are four Oscar nominations, three Emmy Awards, a Grammy, seven Saturn Awards for Best Music, the 2002 Richard Kirk Award, the 2015 Disney Legend Award, the Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award in 2017, and the Society of Composers &amp; Lyricists Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022.

==Early life==
Elfman was born on May 29, 1953, in Los Angeles, California to a Jewish family of Russian descent. He is a son of Blossom Elfman (née Bernstein), a writer and teacher, and Milton Elfman, a teacher, and the brother of actor, musician, and journalist Richard Elfman. Elfman was raised in an affluent, racially-mixed community in Baldwin Hills, California, where he spent much of his time at the local movie theater discovering classic sci-fi, fantasy and horror films and first noticed the music of such film composers as Bernard Herrmann and Franz Waxman. Elfman has admitted to fabricating stories about his past out of boredom, including a false birthplace of Amarillo, Texas, and parents in the United States Air Force.

In his early school days, Elfman exhibited an aptitude for science with almost no interest in music, and was even rejected from elementary school orchestra &quot;for having no propensity for music.&quot; This would change when he switched high schools in the late 1960s and fell in with a musical crowd, who introduced him to early jazz and the work of Stravinsky and his 20th-century contemporaries. Elfman attended University High School in Los Angeles before dropping out.

Elfman left school to follow his brother Richard to France, where he performed violin with Jérôme Savary&#x27;s Le Grand Magic Circus, an avant-garde musical theater group. He then embarked on a ten-month, self-guided tour through Africa, busking and collecting a range of West African percussion instruments until a series of illnesses forced him to return home. At this time, Richard was forming a new musical theater group in Los Angeles.

==Career==
===Oingo Boingo===

After returning to Los Angeles from Africa in the early 1970s, Elfman was asked by his brother Richard to serve as musical director of his street theatre performance art troupe The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. Elfman was tasked with adapting and arranging 1920s and 1930s jazz and big band music by artists such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Django Reinhardt and Josephine Baker for the ensemble, which consisted of up to 15 performers playing upwards of 30 instruments. He also composed original pieces and helped build instruments unique for the group, including an aluminum gamelan, the &#x27;Schlitz celeste&#x27; made from tuned beer cans, and a &quot;junkyard orchestra&quot; built from car parts and trash cans.

The Mystic Knights performed on the street and in theaters, and later in nightclubs throughout Los Angeles until Richard left in 1976 to pursue filmmaking. As a send-off to the group&#x27;s original concept, Richard produced the film &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; based on the Mystic Knights&#x27; stage performances. Elfman composed the songs and his first score for the film, and appeared as the character Satan, who performs a reworked version of Calloway&#x27;s &quot;Minnie the Moocher.&quot;

Before the release of &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, Elfman took over the Mystic Knights as lead singer-songwriter in 1976. In 1979, he pared the group down to eight players to record and tour as a ska-influenced new wave band. That summer, the group&#x27;s name would change to Oingo Boingo. Their biggest success among eight studio albums penned by Elfman was 1985&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;, featuring the hit song &quot;Weird Science&quot; from the movie of the same name. The band also appeared performing their single &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; in the 1986 movie &quot;Back to School&quot;, for which Elfman also composed the score. Elfman shifted the band to a more guitar-oriented rock sound in the late 1980s, which continued through their last album &quot;Boingo&quot; in 1994.

Citing permanent hearing damage from performing live and conflicts with his film-scoring career, Elfman retired Oingo Boingo in 1995 with a series of five sold-out final concerts at the Universal Amphitheatre ending on Halloween night. On October 31, 2015, Elfman and Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek performed the song &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; with an orchestra as an encore to a live-to-film concert of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; score at the Hollywood Bowl. Elfman told the audience the performance was &quot;20 years to the day&quot; of Oingo Boingo&#x27;s retirement.

===Film scoring===
As fans of Oingo Boingo, Tim Burton and Paul Reubens invited Elfman to write the score for their first feature film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; in 1985. Elfman was initially apprehensive because of his lack of formal training and having never scored a studio feature, but after Burton accepted his initial demo of the title music, and with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger Steve Bartek, Elfman completed the score to great effect, paying homage to influential film composers Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann. Elfman described the first time he heard his music played by a full orchestra as one of the most thrilling experiences of his life.

Following &quot;Pee Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, Elfman scored a string of comedies in the late 1980s, including &quot;Back to School&quot; starring Rodney Dangerfield, Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and the Bill Murray film &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Non-comedy work included the all-synth score to Emilio Estevez&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Wisdom&quot; and the big band, blues-infused music for Martin Brest&#x27;s buddy cop action film &quot;Midnight Run&quot;.

In 1989, Elfman&#x27;s influential, Grammy-winning score for Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; marked a major stylistic shift to dark, densely orchestrated music in the romantic idiom. This continued in his scores for Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Darkman&quot; and Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, all released in 1990.

With &quot;Batman&quot;, Elfman firmly established a career-spanning relationship with Burton, scoring all but three of the director&#x27;s major studio releases. Highlights include &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003) and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010). In 1993, Elfman wrote the score and ten songs for the Burton-produced stop motion animated film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, directed by Henry Selick, and also provided the singing voice for main character Jack Skellington, as well as the voices for secondary characters Barrel, the Clown with the Tear-Away Face and others. In 2005, he wrote the score and songs for Burton&#x27;s &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; and provided the voice of the character of Bonejangles, and provided the score, songs and Oompa-Loompa vocals for Burton&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; that same year.

In addition to frequent collaborations with Burton, Raimi and Gus Van Sant, Elfman has worked with directors such as Brian De Palma, Peter Jackson, Joss Whedon, Errol Morris, Ang Lee, Richard Donner, Guillermo del Toro, David O. Russell, Taylor Hackford, Jon Amiel, Joe Johnston, and Barry Sonnenfeld. His scores for Sonnenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Men in Black&quot;, Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;Milk&quot;, and Burton&#x27;s &quot;Big Fish&quot; all received Academy Award nominations.

Since the mid-1990s, Elfman expanded his craft to a range of genres, including thrillers (&quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom, The Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window&quot;), dramas (&quot;Sommersby&quot;, &quot;A Civil Action&quot;, &quot;Hitchcock&quot;), indies (&quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot, White Noise&quot;), family (&quot;Flubber&quot;, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps, Dolittle&quot;), documentary (&quot;Standard Operating Procedure&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Known&quot;), and horror (&quot;Red Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Wolfman&quot;), as well as entries in his well-established areas of horror comedy (&quot;The Frighteners&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;) and comic book-inspired action films (&quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Wanted&quot;, &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;).

Among his franchise work, Elfman composed the scores for four &quot;Men in Black&quot; films (1997–2019) and three &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; films (2015–2018). In 1996, he scored the first film in the , adapting themes for the original television series by Lalo Schifrin as well as composing his own. Elfman scored Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; in 2004, themes and selections from which were used for Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, scored by Christopher Young. Elfman&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; theme was incorporated into the MCU film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; composed by Michael Giacchino.

Elfman entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe by providing additional music in 2015&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, receiving composer credit with Brian Tyler. Elfman also scored MCU&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; in 2022, utilizing Giacchino&#x27;s theme to the original &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; film, as well as themes from WandaVision and X-Men: The Animated Series, and music from Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony and Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue.

For several high-profile sequel and reboot projects in the 2010s, Elfman incorporated established musical themes with his own original thematic material, including the DC Extended Universe&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;The Grinch,&quot; &quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;Men in Black International&quot;.

Elfman was featured in the 2016 documentary &quot;&quot;, in which he appeared among over 50 film composers to discuss the craft of movie music and influential figures in the business.

From January 2021 on the eleventh day of each month, he released five subsequent singles &quot;Sorry&quot;, &quot;Love in the Time of COVID&quot;, &quot;Kick Me&quot;, &quot;True&quot;, and a reworking of the Oingo Boingo song &quot;Insects&quot; from the album &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot;. This culminated with the release of the double album &quot;Big Mess&quot; on June 11. Featuring 18 original songs, this was Elfman&#x27;s first solo studio album since 1984&#x27;s &quot;So-Lo&quot;.

On August 11, 2021, Elfman released a remix of &quot;True&quot; with lead vocals shared between Elfman and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. A year later, Elfman released &quot;Bigger Messier&quot;, a compilation of 23 remixes of songs on the album &quot;Big Mess&quot; by artists including Reznor, Iggy Pop, Blixa Bargeld, Squarepusher, Boy Harsher and more.

==Influences and style==
Elfman has said his major influences are composers from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, such as Bernard Herrmann, Dimitri Tiomkin, Max Steiner, David Tamkin, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and Carl Stalling; 20th century classical composers Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Carl Orff; and jazz, experimental and minimalist composers Kurt Weill, Duke Ellington, Harry Partch, Philip Glass, Lou Harrison, Terry Riley, and Steve Reich.

Influences on specific scores include Erik Satie (&quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;), Nino Rota (&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;), George Gershwin (&quot;Dick Tracy&quot;), Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;), and Jimi Hendrix (&quot;Dead Presidents&quot;). Though not considered direct influences &quot;per se&quot;, Elfman has discussed his respect and admiration for film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ennio Morricone, Thomas Newman, Alexandre Desplat and John Williams, as well as classical composer John Adams.

Though many believe Richard Wagner informed his influential score to &quot;Batman&quot;, Elfman has said it was more likely from Wagner&#x27;s influence on classic film composers such as Herrmann, Steiner, Waxman and Korngold, as he was unfamiliar with Wagner&#x27;s work at the time.

Elfman counts Herrmann as his biggest influence, and has said hearing Herrmann&#x27;s score to &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; when he was a child was the first time he recognized film music as a cinematic art form and realized the powerful contribution a composer makes to the movies. Pastiche of Herrmann&#x27;s music can be heard in Elfman&#x27;s &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, especially the cues &quot;Stolen Bike&quot; and &quot;Clown Dream&quot;, which directly reference Herrmann&#x27;s music from &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; respectively. His score to &quot;Batman&quot; makes more subtle nods to Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and more integral homage can be heard in later scores for &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; and &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, as well as the &quot;Blue Strings&quot; movement of his first concert work &quot;Serenada Schizophrana&quot;.

While Elfman is primarily known for writing large-scale orchestral works in the romantic, 20th century and Hollywood Golden Age film score traditions, his compositions have used a wide range of idioms, including rock and blues (&quot;Midnight Run, Hot to Trot&quot;), big band and jazz (&quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;), operetta (&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;), funk and hip hop (&quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, &quot;Notorious&quot;), folk and indie rock (&quot;Taking Woodstock&quot;, &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;), Americana (&quot;Article 99&quot;, &quot;Sommersby&quot;, &quot;Big Fish),&quot; minimalism (&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Standard Operating Procedure&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Known&quot;), and atonal or experimental (&quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;A Simple Plan, The Girl on the Train&quot;).

Given his appreciation and study of world music and his vast collection of instruments from non-Western cultures, Elfman will often use traditional instruments in his scores when there is an international setting, such as African percussion for &quot;Instinct&quot;, the oud for &quot;The Kingdom&quot; set in Saudi Arabia, and pan flute for &quot;Proof of Life&quot; set in South America.

When working on films with established musical identifiers, Elfman will often incorporate original themes in addition to his own thematic material. Examples include Lalo Schifrin&#x27;s main theme and &quot;The Plot&quot; from the original for &quot;&quot;; John Williams&#x27; theme for &quot;Superman&quot;, the Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL theme for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and his own original &quot;Batman&quot; theme for &quot;Justice League;&quot; the &quot;Welcome Christmas&quot; song from the 1966 &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; for &quot;The Grinch&quot;; and &quot;Casey Junior,&quot; &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade,&quot; and &quot;When I See an Elephant Fly&quot; from Disney&#x27;s original 1941 animated film for &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

The songs for &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; were influenced by Kurt Weill, Gilbert and Sullivan and early Rodgers and Hammerstein. At the request of Tim Burton, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; songs drew inspiration from Bollywood, the Mamas and the Papas, ABBA, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire individually.

Elfman&#x27;s work in pop music and specifically as songwriter for Oingo Boingo was influenced by the Specials, Madness, the Selecter, Devo, Fun Boy Three, and XTC.

==Methods==
===Film music===
For his film scores, Elfman draws musical inspiration almost exclusively from viewing a cut of the film, and occasionally from visits to the set while the film is in production (he wrote and orchestrated his theme for &quot;Batman&quot; on an airplane to Los Angeles after visiting the set in London). While he prefers not to work from script, story or concept, exceptions include &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, for which ten songs needed to be written in advance of filmmaking, and &quot;Dumbo&quot;, for which he composed the main theme before filming began.

Once a rough cut of the film is ready, Elfman and the director have a spotting session to decide where to place music in the film, the emotional undercurrents of each scene, and overall tone. Elfman then spends a few weeks of free composition and experimentation to begin working out thematic material and to develop sounds and the harmonic palette.

When he has received approval on initial material from the filmmakers, Elfman begins to compose anywhere from 60 to 120 minutes of music cue-by-cue. He says two of the most important things to capture at this point are the tone of each scene and editorial rhythm. Next to thematic development, action set pieces tend to take Elfman the most time given the complexity of timing music to action.

Early in his career, he wrote out his scores using pencil, but has composed largely digitally since the mid-1990s.

Before recording the score, he demos each cue by mocking orchestral and choral parts on synthesizer to get approval from the director. Once approved, he provides a detailed, multi-line sketch of his composition to his lead orchestrator Steve Bartek, who ensures the sketches are appropriately broken down for sections of the orchestra (i.e. string, brass woodwind, some percussion), choir (SATB) and individual players.

Elfman also typically samples or records his own percussion and guitar playing to overlay with live orchestra. More than half of some scores feature Elfman&#x27;s performance, including &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot; and &quot;The Circle.&quot;

To produce the score, Elfman rents a recording studio and hires a conductor and orchestra/choir. He oversees the recording from the control booth so that he can troubleshoot with the film&#x27;s director and recording engineers. The final recording is given to the film&#x27;s sound department to mix with dialogue and sound effects for the film&#x27;s complete soundtrack. Elfman will usually do a separate mix of select cues for an album presentation of the score, and has produced nearly 100 to date.

On the occasion that there are compressed deadlines or in the event he is not available to rescore or adapt his music if there are major edits to the film after the score&#x27;s completion, Elfman will hire additional composers to work on small cues or sections of cues, adapting his existing material or themes. Examples include Jonathan Sheffer on &quot;Darkman&quot;, David Buckley on the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; films, and Pinar Toprak on &quot;Justice League&quot;. Since the 1990s, Elfman has occasionally co-composed music or shared music writing credit (e.g.&quot;When We Rise&quot;, &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Men in Black International&quot;), or written themes that are then used or adapted by other composers, including Jonathan Sheffer (&quot;Pure Luck&quot;), Steve Bartek (&quot;Novacaine&quot;), John Debney (&quot;Heartbreakers&quot;), Deborah Lurie (&quot;9&quot;), and the Newton Brothers (&quot;Before I Wake&quot;).

Elfman has only collaborated once with another artist: Siouxsie and the Banshees, on the song &quot;Face to Face&quot; for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in 1992. It was a long-distance collaboration, as the studio needed the song very quickly; Siouxsie created the foundation of the song and sent it to Elfman, who added elements, and the two would send the track back and forth. Regarding collaboration, Elfman would later state, &quot;I&#x27;m not used to collaborating at all with anybody. I did one track with Siouxsie and the Banshees but that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve always been in my own bubble, and that bubble has been very fertile&quot;.

===Concert music===
In the liner notes for the 2006 CD recording of his first concert work &quot;Serenada Schizophrana&quot;, Elfman wrote: &quot;I began composing several dozen short improvisational compositions, maybe a minute each. Slowly, some of them began to develop themselves until finally I had six separate movements that, in some abstract, absurd way, felt connected.&quot;

To create the cadenzas for his violin concerto &quot;Eleven Eleven&quot;, Elfman collaborated with soloist Sandy Cameron, for whom the piece was written.

===Vocals===
Elfman often incorporates choral or vocal arrangements into his film scores, notably the use of women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s choirs (&quot;Scrooged&quot;, &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Grinch&quot;), and solo voice or vocal effects (&quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, &quot;Flubber&quot;, &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;). Evoking the &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, he set made-up, Latin-sounding text for SATB choir in standout cue &quot;Descent into Mystery&quot; from &quot;Batman&quot;.

Elfman also adds his own vocals into compositions in much the same way he mixes his percussion and guitar performances into orchestral arrangements. Prominent use can be heard in the scores for &quot;To Die For&quot; (sung with director Gus Van Sant, credited to &quot;Little Gus and the Suzettes&quot;), &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, and his music for the Hong Kong Disneyland ride Mystic Manor. He provided the singing voice for characters in &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; in addition to composing the scores and songs, and can be heard singing the &quot;Day-O&quot; call in the style of Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot; in the first bars of the &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; main title.

For Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, Elfman set Roald Dahl&#x27;s text for the Oompa-Loompa characters as four stylistically distinct songs: the Bollywood-influenced &quot;Augustus Gloop&quot;, the funk-infused &quot;Violet Beauregarde&quot;, the psychedelic pop stylings of &quot;Veruca Salt&quot; and the baroque rock of &quot;Mike Teavee&quot;. For all songs in the film, Elfman sang, manipulated and mixed several layers of his vocals to create the singing voices and harmonies of the Oompa Loompas, and incorporated his vocals into non-song score tracks that featured the characters, including &quot;Loompa Land&quot;, &quot;Chocolate River&quot;, &quot;The Boat Arrives&quot; and &quot;The River Cruise&quot;.

===Lyrics===
Elfman typically writes the lyrics to songs he has composed for movies. He employs song structures from Tin Pan Alley and early musical theatre composers (32-bar form), and pop and rock of the 1950s and 1960s (verse-chorus). As his songs serve to advance the plot and develop characters, lyrics reflect storylines and imagery specific to the film and express the inner life of characters.

He wrote the lyrics and music for ten songs featured in the stop-motion musical &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. Drawing from Tim Burton&#x27;s parody poem of &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; and concept drawings, Elfman wrote each song in consultation with Burton before the film even had a script. These include the full-cast songs &quot;This Is Halloween&quot;, &quot;Town Meeting Song&quot; and &quot;Making Christmas&quot;; four songs for the main character Jack Skellington, &quot;Jack&#x27;s Lament&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot;, &quot;Jack&#x27;s Obsession&quot; and &quot;Poor Jack&quot;, all sung by Elfman; and the other character songs &quot;Kidnap the Sandy Claws&quot;, &quot;Oogie Boogie&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot;. An eleventh song, &quot;Finale/Reprise&quot;, reworks lyrics from the songs &quot;This Is Halloween&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot; and &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot; for the film&#x27;s ending. Though uncredited, Burton contributed some lyrics to &quot;Nightmare&quot;, including the line &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s the head that I found in the lake&quot; in &quot;Town Meeting Song&quot;.

Elfman composed five songs for Burton&#x27;s &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;: &quot;According to Plan&quot;, with lyrics co-written by screenwriter John August; &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; (which he sung as the character Bonejangles) and &quot;Tears to Shed&quot;, both with additional lyrics by August; and &quot;The Wedding Song&quot;, credited solely to Elfman. The song &quot;Erased&quot; was not used in the final film.

He wrote the lyrics to &quot;Lullaby&quot; from &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, the rock track &quot;The Little Things&quot; from &quot;Wanted&quot; which he also sang in English and Russian, and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Elfman co-wrote the lyrics to &quot;Twice the Love&quot; from &quot;Big Fish&quot; and the &quot;Wonka&#x27;s Welcome Song&quot; for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; with John August.

Elfman wrote the lyrics to all of Oingo Boingo&#x27;s original songs 1979–1994 and has made residuals on the titular two-word opening phrase sung in his &quot;The Simpsons&quot; theme since the series first aired in 1989.

==Personal life==
As a teenager, Elfman dated his classmate Kim Gordon, who would later become one of the members of the rock band Sonic Youth. He has two daughters, Lola and Mali, from his marriage to Geri Eisenmenger. Mali is a film producer and actress. Elfman and Mali collaborated on her 2011 film &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot;.

On November 29, 2003, Elfman married actress Bridget Fonda. They have a son, Oliver. In 1998, Elfman scored &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, starring Fonda. He is the uncle of actor Bodhi Elfman, who is married to actress Jenna Elfman.

Elfman has been an atheist since the age of 11 or 12. In an interview with the New York Post, he referred to himself as a &quot;cynic-ologist&quot;.

Describing his politics during the 1980s, Elfman said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a doomist. My attitude is always to be critical of what&#x27;s around you, but not ever to forget how lucky we are. I&#x27;ve traveled around the world. I left thinking I was a revolutionary. I came back real right-wing patriotic. Since then, I&#x27;ve kind of mellowed in between.&quot; Several of his songs written for Oingo Boingo during this period satirized social politics, although Elfman stated his message was to &quot;question, resist, challenge&quot; and that his songs were not aligned to any one political agenda.

In 2008, Elfman expressed support for Barack Obama. For the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he scored the biographical video played ahead of Joe Biden&#x27;s acceptance of the presidential nomination in the 2020 United States elections. In a series of posts on his Instagram page discussing the video, Elfman criticized Donald Trump, Richard Nixon, and the electoral college, and linked to several voter resources.

During his 18 years with Oingo Boingo, Elfman developed significant hearing damage as a result of the continuous exposure to the high noise levels involved in performing in a rock band. Afraid of worsening his condition, he decided to leave the band, saying that he would never return to that kind of performance. His impairment was so bad that he could not &quot;even sit in a loud restaurant or bar anymore.&quot; However, he found performing in front of orchestras more tolerable, and returned several times to reprise his live performance of Jack Skellington.

===Sexual harassment allegations===
Composer Nomi Abadi has alleged that Elfman had been involved in multiple instances of sexual harassment and misconduct with her that took place from 2015 to 2016. Elfman has denied these claims. The allegations reportedly resulted in Elfman and Abadi agreeing to a non-public settlement and nondisclosure agreement, wherein Elfman would have paid Abadi a total of $830,000 over time. In 2024, Abadi alleged that Elfman had missed payments and had defamed her in statements he made to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2023 regarding this matter, suing Elfman for the full settlement of $830,000.

A second harassment lawsuit was later filed by an anonymous accuser named &quot;Jane Doe&quot; but was dismissed in September 2024, due to the judge finding &quot;no triable issue of fact&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Since &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; second annual &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episode aired in 1991, launching &quot;scary names&quot; tradition in the opening and closing titles, Elfman has been alternately credited for the theme music as &quot;Red Wolf Elfman&quot;, &quot;Danny Skellingelfman&quot;, &quot;Li&#x27;l Leakin Brain Elfman&quot;, &quot;Boris Elfmonivich&quot;, &quot;Danny Elfblood&quot;, &quot;Danny &#x27;Hell&#x27;fman&quot;, &quot;The Bloody Elf&quot;, &quot;Danny Elfbones&quot;, &quot;Elfmunster&quot; and &quot;Daniel Beilzebelsman&quot;.

Elfman&#x27;s composition &quot;Clown Dream&quot; from &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; is used in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; and has often been used as the opening music for Primus concerts.

In the 2007 sixth season &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot; lampooned Elfman&#x27;s orchestral style. A scene shows Elfman replacing an incinerated John Williams to conduct a full orchestra playing the score, only to be decapitated by a lightsaber after conducting a few bars of oom-pah music.

Episode five of the 14th season of &quot;South Park&quot; in 2010 criticized Tim Burton for using the &quot;same&quot; music in all his films, referring to Elfman&#x27;s scores.

In October 2016, Elfman produced a video clip for Funny or Die with original &quot;horror&quot; music composed to footage of Donald Trump pacing around Hillary Clinton at the second United States presidential election debates, 2016.

In 2019, selections from Elfman&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Run&quot; score were used in the third season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, including &quot;Stairway Chase&quot; in episodes 5 and 6, and &quot;Wild Ride&quot; and &quot;Package Deal&quot; in episode 6.

Christina Aguilera revealed that Elfman&#x27;s music inspired her Las Vegas concert residency The Xperience.

==List of compositions==

<text>In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus, a line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface, such as the boundary of a cylinder or sphere, has a dimension of two (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. A two-dimensional Euclidean space is a two-dimensional space on the plane. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In classical mechanics, space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time. That conception of the world is a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. The four dimensions (4D) of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. 10 dimensions are used to describe superstring theory (6D hyperspace + 4D), 11 dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory (7D hyperspace + 4D), and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space.

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. s frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be Euclidean spaces or more general parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of degrees of freedom of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent parameters or coordinates that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a line is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a plane is two, etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a curve, such as a circle, is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension lower than two, unless it is a line. Similarly, a surface is of dimension two, even if embedded in three-dimensional space.

The dimension of Euclidean -space is . When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question &quot;what makes -dimensional?&quot; One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in by small balls of radius , one needs on the order of such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension, but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in looks locally like and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension. While these notions agree on , they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A tesseract is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term &quot;dimension&quot; is as in: &quot;A tesseract &quot;has four dimensions&quot;&quot;, mathematicians usually express this as: &quot;The tesseract &quot;has dimension 4&quot;&quot;, or: &quot;The dimension of the tesseract &quot;is&quot; 4&quot; or: 4D.

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to René Descartes, substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of Arthur Cayley, William Rowan Hamilton, Ludwig Schläfli and Bernhard Riemann. Riemann&#x27;s 1854 Habilitationsschrift, Schläfli&#x27;s 1852 &quot;Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität&quot;, and Hamilton&#x27;s discovery of the quaternions and John T. Graves&#x27; discovery of the octonions in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

===Vector spaces===

The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the cardinality of a basis) is often referred to as the &quot;Hamel dimension&quot; or &quot;algebraic dimension&quot; to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.

For the non-free case, this generalizes to the notion of the length of a module.

===Manifolds===

The uniquely defined dimension of every connected topological manifold can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean -space, in which the number is the manifold&#x27;s dimension.

For connected differentiable manifolds, the dimension is also the dimension of the tangent vector space at any point.

In geometric topology, the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the high-dimensional cases are simplified by having extra space in which to &quot;work&quot;; and the cases and are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the Poincaré conjecture, in which four different proof methods are applied.

====Complex dimension====
The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined. While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the real numbers, it is sometimes useful in the study of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties to work over the complex numbers instead. A complex number (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;iy&quot;) has a real part &quot;x&quot; and an imaginary part &quot;y&quot;, in which x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions. For example, an ordinary two-dimensional spherical surface, when given a complex metric, becomes a Riemann sphere of one complex dimension.

===Varieties===

The dimension of an algebraic variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the tangent space at any Regular point of an algebraic variety. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of hyperplanes that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An algebraic set being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains formula_1 of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of &quot;formula_2&quot;).

Each variety can be considered as an algebraic stack, and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if &quot;V&quot; is a variety of dimension &quot;m&quot; and &quot;G&quot; is an algebraic group of dimension &quot;n&quot; acting on &quot;V&quot;, then the quotient stack [&quot;V&quot;/&quot;G&quot;] has dimension &quot;m&quot; − &quot;n&quot;.

===Krull dimension===
The Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of chains of prime ideals in it, a chain of length &quot;n&quot; being a sequence formula_3 of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an algebra over a field, the dimension as vector space is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

===Topological spaces===

For any normal topological space , the Lebesgue covering dimension of is defined to be the smallest integer &quot;n&quot; for which the following holds: any open cover has an open refinement (a second open cover in which each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than elements. In this case dim . For a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer exists, then the dimension of is said to be infinite, and one writes dim . Moreover, has dimension −1, i.e. dim if and only if is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all Tychonoff spaces merely by replacing the term &quot;open&quot; in the definition by the term &quot;functionally open&quot;.

An inductive dimension may be defined inductively as follows. Consider a discrete set of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a &quot;new direction&quot;, one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general, one obtains an ()-dimensional object by dragging an -dimensional object in a &quot;new&quot; direction. The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the &quot;small inductive dimension&quot; or the &quot;large inductive dimension&quot;, and is based on the analogy that, in the case of metric spaces, balls have -dimensional boundaries, permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets. Moreover, the boundary of a discrete set of points is the empty set, and therefore the empty set can be taken to have dimension -1.

Similarly, for the class of CW complexes, the dimension of an object is the largest for which the -skeleton is nontrivial. Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be continuously deformed into a collection of higher-dimensional triangles joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.

===Hausdorff dimension===
The Hausdorff dimension is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially fractals. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all metric spaces and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values. The box dimension or Minkowski dimension is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of fractal dimensions that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values.

===Hilbert spaces===
Every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis, and any two such bases for a particular space have the same cardinality. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space&#x27;s Hamel dimension is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

== In physics ==

===Spatial dimensions===
Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies &quot;i.e.&quot;, moving in a linear combination of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See Space and Cartesian coordinate system.)

===Time===
A temporal dimension, or time dimension, is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the &quot;fourth dimension&quot; for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move in one direction.

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is Poincaré and Einstein&#x27;s special relativity (and extended to general relativity), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional manifold, known as spacetime, and in the special, flat case as Minkowski space. Time is different from other spatial dimensions as time operates in all spatial dimensions. Time operates in the first, second and third as well as theoretical spatial dimensions such as a fourth spatial dimension. Time is not however present in a single point of absolute infinite singularity as defined as a geometric point, as an infinitely small point can have no change and therefore no time. Just as when an object moves through positions in space, it also moves through positions in time. In this sense the force moving any object to change is &quot;time&quot;.

===Additional dimensions===

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four fundamental forces by introducing extra dimensions/hyperspace. Most notably, superstring theory requires 10 spacetime dimensions, and originates from a more fundamental 11-dimensional theory tentatively called M-theory which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. Supergravity theory also promotes 11D spacetime = 7D hyperspace + 4 common dimensions. To date, no direct experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If hyperspace exists, it must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be &quot;curled up&quot; at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments.

In 1921, Kaluza–Klein theory presented 5D including an extra dimension of space. At the level of quantum field theory, Kaluza–Klein theory unifies gravity with gauge interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces electromagnetism. However, at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe quantum gravity. Therefore, these models still require a UV completion, of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions (6D hyperspace) forming a Calabi–Yau manifold. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.

In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead are not apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a subspace. Thus, the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be large extra dimensions. D-branes are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the brane by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or &quot;the bulk&quot;. This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to cosmology. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be since three is the largest number of spatial dimensions in which strings can generically intersect. If initially there are many windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.

Extra dimensions are said to be universal if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

==In computer graphics and spatial data==
Several types of digital systems are based on the storage, analysis, and visualization of geometric shapes, including illustration software, Computer-aided design, and Geographic information systems. Different vector systems use a wide variety of data structures to represent shapes, but almost all are fundamentally based on a set of geometric primitives corresponding to the spatial dimensions:
* Point (0-dimensional), a single coordinate in a Cartesian coordinate system.
* Line or Polyline (1-dimensional) usually represented as an ordered list of points sampled from a continuous line, whereupon the software is expected to interpolate the intervening shape of the line as straight- or curved-line segments.
* Polygon (2-dimensional) usually represented as a line that closes at its endpoints, representing the boundary of a two-dimensional region. The software is expected to use this boundary to partition 2-dimensional space into an interior and exterior.
* Surface (3-dimensional) represented using a variety of strategies, such as a polyhedron consisting of connected polygon faces. The software is expected to use this surface to partition 3-dimensional space into an interior and exterior.

Frequently in these systems, especially GIS and Cartography, a representation of a real-world phenomenon may have a different (usually lower) dimension than the phenomenon being represented. For example, a city (a two-dimensional region) may be represented as a point, or a road (a three-dimensional volume of material) may be represented as a line. This &quot;dimensional generalization&quot; correlates with tendencies in spatial cognition. For example, asking the distance between two cities presumes a conceptual model of the cities as points, while giving directions involving travel &quot;up,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; or &quot;along&quot; a road imply a one-dimensional conceptual model. This is frequently done for purposes of data efficiency, visual simplicity, or cognitive efficiency, and is acceptable if the distinction between the representation and the represented is understood but can cause confusion if information users assume that the digital shape is a perfect representation of reality (i.e., believing that roads really are lines).

<doc id="8400" wikidata="Q212177" url="?curid=8400" title="Duodecimal">
<text>The duodecimal system, also known as base twelve or dozenal, is a positional numeral system using twelve as its base. In duodecimal, the number twelve is denoted &quot;10&quot;, meaning 1 twelve and 0 units; in the decimal system, this number is instead written as &quot;12&quot; meaning 1 ten and 2 units, and the string &quot;10&quot; means ten. In duodecimal, &quot;100&quot; means twelve squared (144), &quot;1,000&quot; means twelve cubed (1,728), and &quot;0.1&quot; means a twelfth (.8333...).

Various symbols have been used to stand for ten and eleven in duodecimal notation; this page uses and , as in hexadecimal, which make a duodecimal count from zero to twelve read 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, , , and finally 10. The Dozenal Societies of America and Great Britain (organisations promoting the use of duodecimal) use turned digits in their published material: 2 (a turned 2) for ten (dek, pronounced dɛk) and 3 (a turned 3) for eleven (el, pronounced ɛl).

The number twelve, a superior highly composite number, is the smallest number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the subitizing range, and the smallest abundant number. All multiples of reciprocals of 3-smooth numbers ( where are integers) have a terminating representation in duodecimal. In particular,  (0.3),  (0.4),  (0.6),  (0.8), and  (0.9) all have a short terminating representation in duodecimal. There is also higher regularity observable in the duodecimal multiplication table. As a result, duodecimal has been described as the optimal number system.

In these respects, duodecimal is considered superior to decimal, which has only 2 and 5 as factors, and other proposed bases like octal or hexadecimal. Sexagesimal (base sixty) does even better in this respect (the reciprocals of all 5-smooth numbers terminate), but at the cost of unwieldy multiplication tables and a much larger number of symbols to memorize.

== Origin ==
:&quot;In this section, numerals are in decimal. For example, &quot;10&quot; means 9+1, and &quot;12&quot; means 9+3.&quot;

Georges Ifrah speculatively traced the origin of the duodecimal system to a system of finger counting based on the knuckle bones of the four larger fingers. Using the thumb as a pointer, it is possible to count to 12 by touching each finger bone, starting with the farthest bone on the fifth finger, and counting on. In this system, one hand counts repeatedly to 12, while the other displays the number of iterations, until five dozens, i.e. the 60, are full. This system is still in use in many regions of Asia.

Languages using duodecimal number systems are uncommon. Languages in the Nigerian Middle Belt such as Janji, Gbiri-Niragu (Gure-Kahugu), Piti, and the Nimbia dialect of Gwandara; and the Chepang language of Nepal are known to use duodecimal numerals.

Germanic languages have special words for 11 and 12, such as &quot;eleven&quot; and &quot;twelve&quot; in English. They come from Proto-Germanic *&quot;ainlif&quot; and *&quot;twalif&quot; (meaning, respectively, &quot;one left&quot; and &quot;two left&quot;), suggesting a decimal rather than duodecimal origin. However, Old Norse used a hybrid decimal–duodecimal counting system, with its words for &quot;one hundred and eighty&quot; meaning 200 and &quot;two hundred&quot; meaning 240. In the British Isles, this style of counting survived well into the Middle Ages as the long hundred.

Historically, units of time in many civilizations are duodecimal. There are twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve months in a year, and the Babylonians had twelve hours in a day (although at some point, this was changed to 24). Traditional Chinese calendars, clocks, and compasses are based on the twelve Earthly Branches or 24 (12×2) Solar terms. There are 12 inches in an imperial foot, 12 troy ounces in a troy pound, 12 old British pence in a shilling, 24 (12×2) hours in a day; many other items are counted by the dozen, gross (144, square of 12), or great gross (1728, cube of 12). The Romans used a fraction system based on 12, including the uncia, which became both the English words &quot;ounce&quot; and &quot;inch&quot;. Pre-decimalisation, Ireland and the United Kingdom used a mixed duodecimal-vigesimal currency system (12 pence = 1 shilling, 20 shillings or 240 pence to the pound sterling or Irish pound), and Charlemagne established a monetary system that also had a mixed base of twelve and twenty, the remnants of which persist in many places.

== Notations and pronunciations ==
In a positional numeral system of base &quot;n&quot; (twelve for duodecimal), each of the first &quot;n&quot; natural numbers is given a distinct numeral symbol, and then &quot;n&quot; is denoted &quot;10&quot;, meaning 1 times &quot;n&quot; plus 0 units. For duodecimal, the standard numeral symbols for 0–9 are typically preserved for zero through nine, but there are numerous proposals for how to write the numerals representing &quot;ten&quot; and &quot;eleven&quot;. More radical proposals do not use any Arabic numerals under the principle of &quot;separate identity.&quot;

Pronunciation of duodecimal numbers also has no standard, but various systems have been proposed.

=== Transdecimal symbols ===
Several authors have proposed using letters of the alphabet for the transdecimal symbols. Latin letters such as (as in hexadecimal) or (initials of &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Eleven&quot;) are convenient because they are widely accessible, and for instance can be typed on typewriters. However, when mixed with ordinary prose, they might be confused for letters. As an alternative, Greek letters such as could be used instead. Frank Emerson Andrews, an early American advocate for duodecimal, suggested and used in his 1935 book &quot;New Numbers&quot; (italic capital X from the Roman numeral for ten and a rounded italic capital E similar to open E), along with italic numerals –.

Edna Kramer in her 1951 book &quot;The Main Stream of Mathematics&quot; used a (sextile or six-pointed asterisk, hash or octothorpe). The symbols were chosen because they were available on some typewriters; they are also on push-button telephones. This notation was used in publications of the Dozenal Society of America (DSA) from 1974 to 2008.

From 2008 to 2015, the DSA used , the symbols devised by William Addison Dwiggins.

The Dozenal Society of Great Britain (DSGB) proposed symbols . This notation, derived from Arabic digits by 180° rotation, was introduced by Isaac Pitman in 1857. In March 2013, a proposal was submitted to include the digit forms for ten and eleven propagated by the Dozenal Societies in the Unicode Standard. Of these, the British/Pitman forms were accepted for encoding as characters at code points and . They were included in Unicode 8.0 (2015).

After the Pitman digits were added to Unicode, the DSA took a vote and then began publishing PDF content using the Pitman digits instead, but continues to use the letters X and E on its webpage.

===Base notation===
There are also varying proposals of how to distinguish a duodecimal number from a decimal one. The most common method used in mainstream mathematics sources comparing various number bases uses a subscript &quot;10&quot; or &quot;12&quot;, e.g. &quot;5412 = 6410&quot;. To avoid ambiguity about the meaning of the subscript 10, the subscripts might be spelled out, &quot;54twelve = 64ten&quot;. In 2015 the Dozenal Society of America adopted the more compact single-letter abbreviation &quot;z&quot; for &quot;dozenal&quot; and &quot;d&quot; for &quot;decimal&quot;, &quot;54z = 64d&quot;.

Other proposed methods include italicizing duodecimal numbers &quot;&quot;54&quot; = 64&quot;, adding a &quot;Humphrey point&quot; (a semicolon instead of a decimal point) to duodecimal numbers &quot;54;6 = 64.5&quot;, prefixing duodecimal numbers by an asterisk &quot;*54 = 64&quot;, or some combination of these. The Dozenal Society of Great Britain uses an asterisk prefix for duodecimal whole numbers, and a Humphrey point for other duodecimal numbers.

=== Pronunciation ===
The Dozenal Society of America suggested the pronunciation of ten and eleven as &quot;dek&quot; and &quot;el&quot;. Terms for some powers of twelve already exist in English.

==== Base-12 nomenclature in English ====
Another nominal for twelve (1210) is a &quot;dozen&quot; (1012 &quot;or&quot; 1•10112).

One hundred and forty-four (14410) is also known as a &quot;gross&quot; (10012 &quot;or&quot; 1•10212).

One thousand, seven hundred and twenty-eight is (172810) also known as a &quot;great-gross&quot; (1,00012 or 1•10312).

==== Duodecimal numbers ====
In this system, the prefix &quot;e&quot;- is added for fractions.

As numbers get larger (or fractions smaller), the last two morphemes are successively replaced with tri-mo, quad-mo, penta-mo, and so on.

Multiple digits in this series are pronounced differently: 12 is &quot;do two&quot;; 30 is &quot;three do&quot;; 100 is &quot;gro&quot;; 9 is &quot;el gro dek do nine&quot;; 86 is &quot;el gro eight do six&quot;; 8,15 is &quot;eight gro el do el, one gro five do dek&quot;; ABA is &quot;dek gro el do dek&quot;; BBB is &quot;el gro el do el&quot;; 0.06 is &quot;six egro&quot;; and so on.

==== Systematic Dozenal Nomenclature (SDN) ====
This system uses &quot;-qua&quot; ending for the positive powers of 12 and &quot;-cia&quot; ending for the negative powers of 12, and an extension of the IUPAC systematic element names (with syllables dec and lev for the two extra digits needed for duodecimal) to express which power is meant.

After hex-, further prefixes continue sept-, oct-, enn-, dec-, lev-, unnil-, unun-.

== Advocacy and &quot;dozenalism&quot; ==
William James Sidis used 12 as the base for his constructed language Vendergood in 1906, noting it being the smallest number with four factors and its prevalence in commerce.

The case for the duodecimal system was put forth at length in Frank Emerson Andrews&#x27; 1935 book &quot;New Numbers: How Acceptance of a Duodecimal Base Would Simplify Mathematics&quot;. Emerson noted that, due to the prevalence of factors of twelve in many traditional units of weight and measure, many of the computational advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized &quot;either&quot; by the adoption of ten-based weights and measure &quot;or&quot; by the adoption of the duodecimal number system.
Both the Dozenal Society of America and the Dozenal Society of Great Britain promote widespread adoption of the duodecimal system. They use the word &quot;dozenal&quot; instead of &quot;duodecimal&quot; to avoid the more overtly decimal terminology. However, the etymology of &quot;dozenal&quot; itself is also an expression based on decimal terminology since &quot;dozen&quot; is a direct derivation of the French word &quot;douzaine&quot;, which is a derivative of the French word for twelve, &quot;douze&quot;, descended from Latin &quot;duodecim&quot;.

Mathematician and mental calculator Alexander Craig Aitken was an outspoken advocate of duodecimal:


=== In media ===
In &quot;Little Twelvetoes,&quot; an episode of the American educational television series &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;, a farmer encounters an alien being with twelve fingers on each hand and twelve toes on each foot who uses duodecimal arithmetic. The alien uses &quot;dek&quot; and &quot;el&quot; as names for ten and eleven, and Andrews&#x27; script-X and script-E for the digit symbols.

=== Duodecimal systems of measurements ===
Systems of measurement proposed by dozenalists include:
* Tom Pendlebury&#x27;s TGM system
* Takashi Suga&#x27;s Universal Unit System
* John Volan&#x27;s Primel system

== Comparison to other number systems ==
:&quot;In this section, numerals are in decimal. For example, &quot;10&quot; means 9+1, and &quot;12&quot; means 9+3.&quot;

The Dozenal Society of America argues that if a base is too small, significantly longer expansions are needed for numbers; if a base is too large, one must memorise a large multiplication table to perform arithmetic. Thus, it presumes that &quot;a number base will need to be between about 7 or 8 through about 16, possibly including 18 and 20&quot;.

The number 12 has six factors, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, of which 2 and 3 are prime. It is the smallest number to have six factors, the largest number to have at least half of the numbers below it as divisors, and is only slightly larger than 10. (The numbers 18 and 20 also have six factors but are much larger.) Ten, in contrast, only has four factors, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10, of which 2 and 5 are prime. Six shares the prime factors 2 and 3 with twelve; however, like ten, six only has four factors (1, 2, 3, and 6) instead of six. Its corresponding base, senary, is below the DSA&#x27;s stated threshold.

Eight and sixteen only have 2 as a prime factor. Therefore, in octal and hexadecimal, the only terminating fractions are those whose denominator is a power of two.

Thirty is the smallest number that has three different prime factors (2, 3, and 5, the first three primes), and it has eight factors in total (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30). Sexagesimal was actually used by the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians, among others; its base, sixty, adds the four convenient factors 4, 12, 20, and 60 to 30 but no new prime factors. The smallest number that has four different prime factors is 210; the pattern follows the primorials. However, these numbers are quite large to use as bases, and are far beyond the DSA&#x27;s stated threshold.

In all base systems, there are similarities to the representation of multiples of numbers that are one less than or one more than the base.&quot;In the following multiplication table, numerals are written in duodecimal. For example, &quot;10&quot; means twelve, and &quot;12&quot; means fourteen.&quot;

== Conversion tables to and from decimal ==
To convert numbers between bases, one can use the general conversion algorithm (see the relevant section under positional notation). Alternatively, one can use digit-conversion tables. The ones provided below can be used to convert any duodecimal number between 0;1 and ,; to decimal, or any decimal number between 0.1 and 99,999.9 to duodecimal. To use them, the given number must first be decomposed into a sum of numbers with only one significant digit each. For example:

:12,345.6 = 10,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 40 + 5 + 0.6

This decomposition works the same no matter what base the number is expressed in. Just isolate each non-zero digit, padding them with as many zeros as necessary to preserve their respective place values. If the digits in the given number include zeroes (for example, 7,080.9), these are left out in the digit decomposition (7,080.9 = 7,000 + 80 + 0.9). Then, the digit conversion tables can be used to obtain the equivalent value in the target base for each digit. If the given number is in duodecimal and the target base is decimal, we get:

: 10,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 40 + 5 + 0;6 &lt;br&gt; = 20,736 + 3,456 + 432 + 48 + 5 + 0.5

Because the summands are already converted to decimal, the usual decimal arithmetic is used to perform the addition and recompose the number, arriving at the conversion result:

 Duodecimal ---&gt; Decimal
 10,000 = 20,736
 2,000 = 3,456 
 300 = 432
 40 = 48
 5 = 5
 + 0;6 = + 0.5
 12,345;6 = 24,677.5

That is, 12,345;6 equals 24,677.5

If the given number is in decimal and the target base is duodecimal, the method is same. Using the digit conversion tables:

 10,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 40 + 5 + 0.6 &lt;br&gt; = 5,954 + 1,18 + 210 + 34 + 5 + 0;

To sum these partial products and recompose the number, the addition must be done with duodecimal rather than decimal arithmetic:

 Decimal --&gt; Duodecimal
 10,000 = 5,954
 2,000 = 1,18
 300 = 210
 40 = 34
 5 = 5
 + 0.6 = + 0;
 12,345.6 = 7,189;

That is, 12,345.6 equals 7,189;

Duodecimal fractions for rational numbers with 3-smooth denominators terminate:
* = 0;6
* = 0;4
* = 0;3
* = 0;2
* = 0;16
* = 0;14
* = 0;1 (this is one twelfth, is one tenth)
* = 0;09 (this is one sixteenth, is one fourteenth)

while other rational numbers have recurring duodecimal fractions:
* = 0;
* = 0;
* = 0;1 (one tenth)
* = 0; (one eleventh)
* = 0; (one thirteenth)
* = 0;0 (one fourteenth)
* = 0;0 (one fifteenth)

As explained in recurring decimals, whenever an irreducible fraction is written in radix point notation in any base, the fraction can be expressed exactly (terminates) if and only if all the prime factors of its denominator are also prime factors of the base.

Because formula_1 in the decimal system, fractions whose denominators are made up solely of multiples of 2 and 5 terminate:  = ,  = , and  =  can be expressed exactly as 0.125, 0.05, and 0.002 respectively. and , however, recur (0.333... and 0.142857142857...).

Because formula_2 in the duodecimal system, is exact; and recur because they include 5 as a factor; is exact, and recurs, just as it does in decimal.

The number of denominators that give terminating fractions within a given number of digits, , in a base is the number of factors (divisors) of formula_3, the th power of the base (although this includes the divisor 1, which does not produce fractions when used as the denominator). The number of factors of &quot;formula_3&quot; is given using its prime factorization.

For decimal, formula_5. The number of divisors is found by adding one to each exponent of each prime and multiplying the resulting quantities together, so the number of factors of &quot;formula_6&quot; is formula_7.

For example, the number 8 is a factor of 103 (1000), so formula_8 and other fractions with a denominator of 8 cannot require more than three fractional decimal digits to terminate. formula_9

For duodecimal, formula_10. This has formula_11 divisors. The sample denominator of 8 is a factor of a gross formula_12 (in decimal), so eighths cannot need more than two duodecimal fractional places to terminate. formula_13

Because both ten and twelve have two unique prime factors, the number of divisors of &quot;formula_3&quot; for grows quadratically with the exponent (in other words, of the order of formula_15).

=== Recurring digits ===
The Dozenal Society of America argues that factors of 3 are more commonly encountered in real-life division problems than factors of 5. Thus, in practical applications, the nuisance of repeating decimals is encountered less often when duodecimal notation is used. Advocates of duodecimal systems argue that this is particularly true of financial calculations, in which the twelve months of the year often enter into calculations.

However, when recurring fractions &quot;do&quot; occur in duodecimal notation, they are less likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because 12 (twelve) is between two prime numbers, 11 (eleven) and 13 (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the composite number 9. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period does not help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so rounding, which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in duodecimal, because one out of every three consecutive numbers contains the prime factor 3 in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor 5. All other prime factors, except 2, are not shared by either ten or twelve, so they do not
influence the relative likeliness of encountering recurring digits (any irreducible fraction that contains any of these other factors in its denominator will recur in either base).

Also, the prime factor 2 appears twice in the factorization of twelve, whereas only once in the factorization of ten; which means that most fractions whose denominators are powers of two will have a shorter, more convenient terminating representation in duodecimal than in decimal:

* 1/(22) = 0.2510 = 0.312
* 1/(23) = 0.12510 = 0.1612
* 1/(24) = 0.062510 = 0.0912
* 1/(25) = 0.0312510 = 0.04612

The duodecimal period length of 1/&quot;n&quot; are (in decimal)

<text>David Hayes Agnew (November 24, 1818March 22, 1892) was an American surgeon.

== Biography ==
Agnew was born on November 24, 1818, Nobleville, Pennsylvania (present-day Christiana). His parents were Robert Agnew and Agnes Noble. Agnew grew up as a Christian. He was surrounded by a family of doctors and had always known he was going to become a physician. As a young boy, he had a sharp sense of humor and was very intelligent.

He was educated at Jefferson College, and at Delaware College in Newark, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine on April 6, 1838. He returned to Nobleville to help his father in his clinic. He worked there for two years. His father was an asthmatic and moved to Maryland in 1840 because the climate was more suited to his condition. Agnew moved with him. On November 21, 1841, he married Margaret Irwin. In 1852, he bought and revived the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. He held responsibility for ten years until 1862. During the American Civil War he was consulting surgeon in the Mower Army Hospital, near Philadelphia, and acquired a considerable reputation for his operations in cases of gunshot wounds. On December 21, 1863, he became the Demonstrator of Anatomy and Assistant Lecturer on Clinical Surgery at The University of Pennsylvania. Later, he was requested to assist the Professor of Surgery in the Conduct of the surgical clinics. In the year 1865, he gave summer instruction courses. For the next seven years, he worked for the university as Demonstrator of Anatomy. A large portion of his success was due to his wife&#x27;s energy, intelligence, and determination. She gave him an impetus to try harder and not be satisfied with his first try.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1872.

== Garfield case ==
On July 2, 1881, President James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau. He held the position of chief consulting surgeon. When a committee came to give him his money for helping, Agnew said, &quot;Gentlemen, I present no bill for my attendance to President Garfield. I gave my services freely and gratuitously&quot;. He was never optimistic about the President&#x27;s case and was not fooled by fallacious beliefs. This procedure helped create Agnew&#x27;s reputation.

== &quot;The Agnew Clinic&quot; ==
&quot;The Agnew Clinic&quot; is an 1889 painting by Thomas Eakins which depicts Agnew conducting a mastectomy operation before a gallery of students and doctors.

== Accomplishments ==
David Agnew wrote &quot;The Principles and Practice of Surgery&quot;, covers an experience of fifty active years, and its value, preserving and presenting as it does the life-work of such a recognized authority, can hardly be overrated. It was a three-volume set that he published from 1878 to 1883. He also helped found the Irwin &amp; Agnew Iron Foundry in 1846.

== Death ==
Agnew caught a severe attack of epidemic influenza in 1890. He never fully recovered. Following this, he had an attack of broncho-vesicular catarrh. On March 9, 1892, he was put to bed for a series of medical problems. After a few days his condition began to improve, but suddenly, on March 12 it became much worse. On March 20, he fell into a comatose condition. Agnew stayed like this until he died at 3:20 p.m. on March 22, 1892. He is now buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery.

<text>Diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics. Diving is an internationally recognised sport that is part of the Olympic Games. In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.

Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as gymnasts and dancers, including strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic judgement and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. Dmitri Sautin holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
In the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing there is a wall painting from around 530 - 500 BCE 
 that shows a person climbing rocks towards a cliff face and a second person diving down the cliff face towards water.

The Tomb of the Diver in Paestum, contains a fresco dating to around 500 to 475 BCE that also shows a scene of a person diving into a pool or stream of water from a structure.

===Plunging===
Although diving has been a popular pastime across the world since ancient times, the first modern diving competitions were held in England in the 1880s. The exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races.

In the seventeenth century gymnasts moved their equipment to the beaches and &quot;performed acrobatics over the water.&quot;

The 1904 book &quot;Swimming&quot; by Ralph Thomas notes English reports of plunging records dating back to at least 1865. The 1877 edition to &quot;British Rural Sports&quot; by John Henry Walsh makes note of a &quot;Mr. Young&quot; plunging in 1870, and also states that 25 years prior, a swimmer named Drake could cover .

The English Amateur Swimming Association (at the time called the Swimming Association of Great Britain) first started a &quot;plunging championship&quot; in 1883. The Plunging Championship was discontinued in 1937.

===Fancy diving===

Diving into a body of water had also been a method used by gymnasts in Germany and Sweden since the early 19th century. The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height. This tradition evolved into &#x27;fancy diving&#x27;, while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as &#x27;Plain diving&#x27;.

In England, the practice of high diving – diving from a great height – gained popularity; the first diving stages were erected at the Highgate Ponds at a height of in 1893 and the first world championship event, the National Graceful Diving Competition, was held there by the Royal Life Saving Society in 1895. The event consisted of standing and running dives from either .

It was at this event that the Swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10 m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, the first organisation devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.

===Olympic era===

Plain diving was first introduced into the Olympics at the 1904 event. The 1908 Olympics in London added &#x27;fancy diving&#x27; and introduced elastic boards rather than fixed platforms. Women were first allowed to participate in the diving events for the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.

In the 1928 Olympics, &#x27;plain&#x27; and &#x27;fancy&#x27; diving were amalgamated into one event – &#x27;Highboard Diving&#x27;. The diving event was first held indoors in the Empire Pool for the 1934 British Empire Games and 1948 Summer Olympics in London.

==Competitive diving==
Most diving competitions consist of three disciplines: 1 m and 3 m springboards, and the platform. Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group. In platform events, competitors are allowed to perform their dives on either the five, seven and a half (generally just called seven), nine, or ten meter towers. In major diving meets, including the Olympic Games and the World Championships, platform diving is from the 10 meter height.

Divers have to perform a set number of dives according to established requirements, including somersaults and twists. Divers are judged on whether and how well they completed all aspects of the dive, the conformance of their body to the requirements of the dive, and the amount of splash created by their entry to the water. A possible score out of ten is broken down into three points for the takeoff (meaning the hurdle), three for the flight (the actual dive), and three for the entry (how the diver hits the water), with one more available to give the judges flexibility.

The raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted. The diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.

===Synchronized diving===
Synchronized diving was adopted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form a team and perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be possible to dive opposites, also known as a pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronised diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.

===Scoring the dive===
There are rules governing the scoring of a dive. Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry. The primary factors affecting the scoring are:

* if a hand-stand is required, the length of time and quality of the hold
* the height of the diver at the apex of the dive, with extra height resulting in a higher score
* the distance of the diver from the diving apparatus throughout the dive (a diver must not be dangerously close, should not be too far away, but should ideally be within of the platform)
* the properly defined body position of the diver according to the dive being performed, including pointed toes and feet touching at all times
* the proper amounts of rotation and revolution upon completion of the dive and entry into the water
* angle of entry – a diver should enter the water straight, without any angle. 
* amount of splash – many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.

Each dive is assigned a &quot;degree of difficulty&quot; (DD), which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.

To reduce the subjectivity of scoring in major meets, panels of five or seven judges are assembled; major international events such as the Olympics use seven-judge panels. For a five-judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD. For seven-judge panels, as of the 2012 London Olympics, the two highest scores and two lowest are discarded, leaving three to be summed and multiplied by the DD. (Prior to the London Olympics, the highest and lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining five scores were multiplied by , to allow for comparison to five-judge panels.) The cancelling of scores is used to make it difficult for a single judge to manipulate scores.

There is a general misconception about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.

In synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation. The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them. The 2012 London Olympics saw the first use of eleven judges.

The score is computed similarly to the scores from other diving events, but has been modified starting with the 2012 London Olympics for the use of the larger judging panels. Each group of judges will have the highest and lowest scores dropped, leaving the middle score for each diver&#x27;s execution and the three middle scores for synchronisation. The total is then weighted by and multiplied by the DD. The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronisation of the divers.

The synchronisation scores are based on:
* time of take-off
* height attained
* synchronisation of rotations and twists
* time of entry to the water
* forward travel from the board

The judges may also disqualify the diver for certain violations during the dive, including:
* receiving a score of 0 on all dives performed in the event
* improper equipment usage (e.g., female divers not using hair ties)

===Competitive strategy===

To win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.

In competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver&#x27;s control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).

In the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors. The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.

There are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.

Generally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a ulk (when the diver stops mid-hurdle) and the change of dive will not be permitted.

Under FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).

It is the diver&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.

==Governance==
The global governing body of diving is FINA, which also governs swimming, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming. Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.

This is frequently a source of political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand the concerns of the diving community. Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.

There are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful. For example, in the UK the Great Britain Diving Federation was formed in 1992 with the intention of taking over the governance of Diving from the ASA (Amateur Swimming Association). Although it initially received widespread support from the diving community, the FINA requirement that international competitors had to be registered with their National Governing Body was a major factor in the abandonment of this ambition a few years later.

Since FINA refused to rescind recognition of the ASA as the British governing body for all aquatic sports including diving, this meant that the elite divers had to belong to ASA-affiliated clubs to be eligible for selection to international competition.

In the United States scholastic diving is almost always part of the school&#x27;s swim team. Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and Club Diving. The NCAA will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.

==Safety==

=== Recreational diving ===

After an incident in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a &quot;suicide dive&quot; (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.
The NSPI had specified a minimum depth of 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. But the courts held that the pool &quot;was close enough&quot; to the standards to hold NSPI liable. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6 million ($8 million after interest was added) in favour of the plaintiff. The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganised into a new swimming pool industry association.

=== Spinal cord injuries ===
It has been commented that for spinal cord injuries related to diving board use in the United States that &quot;For the purposes of obtaining rough estimates of diving board-related injury risks,&quot; the estimated &quot;...rate of SCI [Spinal Cord Injury] due to diving into swimming pools from diving boards to be on the order of 0.028 per 100,000 swimmers...&quot;

=== Submerged objects ===
Many diving accidents occur when divers do not account for submerged objects in the water such as rocks and logs. Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty. It was commetend that &quot;...shallow dives can end up in death or permanent injury.&quot; and that in 1988 on lake powell a person &quot;...was left a quadriplegic after diving just 5 feet off a houseboat into the murky lake.&quot;

===Impact with water===

Water resistance increases with the speed of entry, so entering the water at high-velocity induces rapid deceleration. Jumping into water from a height of 20 feet (6.1 m) results in a person impacting with the water surface at 25 mph (40 km/h). Impacting with the water surface at this velocity is capable of giving a person temporary paralysis of the diaphragm, a compressed spine, broken bones, or concussion.

The speed that a diver is travelling at the water surface when they dive from a ten-metre platform is around 35 mph and when a diver hits the water flat from 10 metres they are brought to rest in about 1 ft. The extreme deceleration when hitting the water flat at around 35 mph can cause severe bruising both internal and external, strains to connective tissue securing the organs, possible minor haemorrhaging to lungs and other tissues possibly resulting in a person coughing up blood, a compressed spine, broken bones, or concussion. This is very painful and distressing, but not life-threatening.

Tom Daley has described one concussion that occurred to him &quot;I missed my hands before the Beijing World Series and smashed my head at 35mph on to the water...&quot;. The concussion resulted in him receiving &quot;headaches, nausea, dizziness...&quot;. It also resulted in Daley being &quot;...out of action for six days and left him unable to dive off his competition height of 10m for three weeks.&quot;

It was commented that in 1989 a 22-year-old, who was a &quot;...diver and a member of the Salt Lake Country Club diving team... ...climbed up on a set of towering rocks... ...about 60 feet...&quot; (18.2 metres). He dove into the water doing a &quot;back flip.&quot; He never surfaced from the water and was found several days later 120 feet below the surface. The 22-year-old was found to have suffered a broken neck.

=== Competitive diving ===

In competitive diving, FINA takes regulatory steps to ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport. For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.

* Group D (11 &amp; under): 5 m
* Group C (12/13 year): 5 m &amp; 7.5 m
* Group B (14/15 year): 5 m, 7.5 m &amp; 10 m
* Group A (16/18 year): 5 m, 7.5 m &amp; 10 m

Group D divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower. In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving. Group D tower was introduced to counteract the phenomenon of coaches pushing young divers to compete in higher age categories, thus putting them at even greater risk.

However, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms. Usually this occurs when advanced Group C divers wish to compete on the 10 m.

Points on pool depths in connection with diving safety:

* most competition pools are 5 m deep for 10 m platform and 4 m deep for 5 m platform or 3 m springboard. These are currently the FINA recommended minimum depths, however some pools are deeper. The deepest diving pool in Europe is in Ponds Forge International Sports Centre at 5.85 m.
* diving from 10 m and maintaining a downward streamlined position results in gliding to a stop at about 4.5–5 m.
* high standard competition divers rarely go more than about 2.5m below the surface, as they roll in the direction of the dive&#x27;s rotation. This is a technique to produce a clean entry.

=== Competitive diving injuries ===

It has been commented that &quot;Competitive diving poses unique risks for both traumatic and overuse injuries in practice and competition.&quot;
It was commented further that &quot;Head, cervical spine, shoulder, and lumbar spine injuries among others are not uncommon, though rates vary significantly in the literature. Existing data suggest that as the level of competition elevates, traumatic injuries (including head injury) become relatively less common, while overuse injuries predominate.&quot;

It has also been commented that &quot;The most frequently injured areas are the wrist, shoulder, and lumbar spine.&quot;

When looking at &quot;...(NCAA) swimming and diving injuries from 2009 to 2014... ...[it was found that there was] an injury rate of 1.94 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures (AE) for males and 2.49 injuries per 1000 AE for females, with more injuries happening during practice over competition.&quot; It has also been found that &quot;...2.1% of divers were injured in the 2008 Olympics... [and] ...8.1% of divers were injured in the 2012 Olympics.&quot; It was further found that &quot;...during the (FINA) World Championships of 2015, 2013, and 2009... ...older athletes in the diving, high diving, and water polo groups were in the highest risk group for injury.&quot;

In relation to springboard diving it has been commented that &quot;The injury-producing forces during the takeoff are related to jumping and deceleration... ...The most common injuries related to this part of the dive are patellar tendinitis, patellar tracking problems, quadriceps tendinitis, Jumper’s knee and patellofemoral compression syndrome commonly caused by repetitive stress placed on the patellar or quadriceps tendon during jumping. Vertical jump ability, as well as jumping and landing technique, are believed to influence tendon loading.&quot;

It has also been commented that 10-metre platform diving can also &quot;...cause repetitive strain injuries from repeatedly pushing off the concrete platform.&quot;

It has further been commented that &quot;Concussions are relatively common, as are pulmonary contusions in which the force of impact bruises the lungs.&quot; Other injuries that may occur include torn triceps muscles, torn ACL ligaments and lower back issues.

When entering the water divers spread their arms and somersault &quot;...either forward or backward underwater...[giving] the illusion of a vertical entry and pull extra water down that hole with them in a maneuver that stresses lower back muscles and hip flexors.&quot; When divers performs this underwater somersault, it is extremely inadvisable to attempt to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation as it can cause serious back injuries.

Injuries that diver Tom Daley has received include &quot;...concussions, torn triceps, broken ribs, [as well as having] coughed up blood.&quot; Tom also has a scar on the top of his head from hitting his head on the diving board.

Tom has also described the deterioration of a knee injury that he received; &quot;During the first lockdown in 2020 I’d torn some cartilage in my knee, but there was no pain and I continued to train. Just when the Olympics was only eight weeks away my knee got tighter and tighter, like a screw being turned. It became locked in a position and I couldn’t straighten it or bend it... ...We booked a scan. We thought maybe it just needed an injection to get it moving again. The doctor also mooted the idea that it might need keyhole surgery. From there I was sent for an MRI scan. From the scan, we could see that the cartilage had not only torn, it had also flipped up and the joint had come back down on top of it... ...It can be flattened and sewn back down, but the surgeon described it as being a bit like a bent credit card that may snap up again or cause more problems. The only other way to fix the problem was to take it out. “There is a recovery time of four to six weeks,” the doctor said... ...A couple of weeks after surgery, I was back in the pool, building my diving back up again.&quot;

=== Competitive diving deaths ===

In 1983, at the World University Games in Edmonton, Canada, diver Sergei Chalibashvili, aged 21, died when he was attempting a reverse 3 1/2-somersault and his head collided with the hardwood 10 metre diving platform. After the accident he was taken to hospital and died a week later.

In 1987 during training diver Nathan Meade, aged 21, died when he struck his head on a 10 metre concrete platform. The dive he was attempting was a reverse 2 1/2 somersault.

==Dive groups==
There are six &quot;groups&quot; into which dives are classified: &quot;Forward, Back, Inward, Reverse, Twist,&quot; and &quot;Armstand&quot;. The armstand group applies only to Platform competitions, whereas the other five groups apply to both Springboard and Platform.

* in the Forward Group (Group 1), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates forward
* in the Back Group (2), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates backward
* in the Reverse Group (3), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates backward
* in the Inward Group (4), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates forward
* any dive incorporating an axial twisting movement is in the Twist group (5)
* any dive commencing from a handstand is in the Armstand group (6) (only on platform)
===Dive positions===
During the flight of the dive, one of four positions is assumed:
* straight – with no bend at the knees or hips (the hardest of the four)
* pike – with knees straight but a tight bend at the hips (the median in difficulty of the four). The open pike is a variant where the arms are reached to the side, and the legs are brought straight out with a bend in the hips.
* tuck – body folded up in a tight ball, hands holding the shins and toes pointed (the easiest of the four)
* free – indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions. In the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist, and points will not be deducted for doing so.

These positions are referred to by the letters A, B, C and D respectively.

Additionally, some dives can be started in a flying position. The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.

Difficulty is rated according to the Degree of Difficulty of the dives. Some divers may find pike easier in a flip than tuck, and most find straight the easiest in a front/back dive, although it is still rated the most difficult because of the risk of overrotation.

An armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilise the equilibrium of the diver.

===Dive numbers===
In competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three- or four-digit numbers. The letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.

The first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.

For groups 1 to 4, the number consists of three digits and a letter of the alphabet. The third digit represents the number of half-somersaults. The second digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 representing a normal somersault, and 1 signifying a &quot;flying&quot; variation of the basic movement (i.e. the first half somersault is performed in the straight position, and then the pike or tuck shape is assumed). No flying dive has been competed at a high level competition for many years.

For example:
* 101A – forward Dive Straight
* 203C – back one-and-a-half somersaults, tuck
* 305C – reverse two-and-a-half somersaults, tuck
* 113B – flying forward one-and-a-half somersaults, pike
* 104C – front double somersaults, tuck

For Group 5, the dive number has 4 digits. The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive. The second digit indicates the group (1–4) of the underlying movement; the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth indicates the number of half-twists.

For example:
* 5211A – back dive, half twist, straight position.
* 5337D – reverse one and a half somersaults with three and a half twists, in the Free position.

For Group 6 – Armstand – the dive number has either three or four digits: Three digits for dives without twist and four for dives with twists.

In non-twisting armstand dives, the second digit indicates the direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.

For example:
* 600A – armstand dive straight
* 612B – armstand forward somersault pike
* 624C – armstand back double somersault tuck

For twisting Armstand dives, the dive number again has 4 digits, but rather than beginning with the number 5, the number 6 remains as the first digit, indicating that the &quot;twister&quot; will be performed from an Armstand. The second digit indicates the direction of rotation – as above, the third is the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth is the number of half-twists:

e.g. 6243D – armstand back double-somersault with one and a half twists in the free position

All of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult/complex a dive is. The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score. Before a diver competes they must decide on a &quot;list&quot; this is a number of optional dives and compulsory dives. The optionals come with a DD limit. this means that a diver must select X number of dives and the combined DD limit must be no more than the limit set by the competition/organisation etc.

Until the mid-1990s the tariff was decided by the FINA diving committee, and divers could only select from the range of dives in the published tariff table. Since then, the tariff is calculated by a formula based on various factors such as the number of twist and somersaults, the height, the group etc., and divers are free to submit new combinations. This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.

==Mechanics of diving==

At the moment of take-off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution. One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.

The speed of rotation – and therefore the total amount of rotation – may be varied from moment to moment by changing the shape of the body, in accordance with the law of conservation of angular momentum.

The center of mass of the diver follows a parabolic path in free-fall under the influence of gravity (ignoring the effects of air resistance, which are negligible at the speeds involved).

===Trajectory===
Since the parabola is symmetrical, the travel away from the board as the diver passes it is twice the amount of the forward travel at the peak of the flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalised when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.

The greatest possible height that can be achieved is desirable for several reasons:

* the height attained is itself one of the factors that the judges will reward.
* a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute manoeuvres.
* for any given clearance when passing the board, the forward travel distance to the entry point will be less for a higher trajectory.

===Control of rotation===
The magnitude of angular momentum remains constant throughout the dive, but since

::angular momentum = rotational velocity × moment of inertia,

and the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius, the speed of rotation may be increased by moving the body into a compact shape, and reduced by opening out into a straight position.

Since the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform. Dives in the straight position are hardest, since there is almost no scope for altering the speed, so the angular momentum must be created at take-off with a very high degree of accuracy. (A small amount of control is available by moving the position of the arms and by a slight hollowing of the back).

The opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down. The vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface. A small amount of additional tuning is available by &#x27;entry save&#x27; techniques, whereby underwater movements of the upper body and arms against the viscosity of the water affect the position of the legs.

===Twisting===

Dives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.

The rules state that twisting &quot;must not be generated manifestly on take-off&quot;. Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements. The physics of twisting can be explained by looking at the components of the angular momentum vector.

As the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example. For twisting rotation to exist, it is necessary to tilt the body sideways after takeoff, so that there is now a small component of this horizontal angular momentum vector along the body&#x27;s long axis. The tilt can be seen in the photo.

The tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist. When one arm is moved up and the other is moved down (like turning a big steering wheel), the body reacts by tilting to the side, which then begins the twisting rotation. At the completion of the required number of twist rotations, the arm motion is reversed (the steering wheel is turned back), which removes the body&#x27;s tilt and stops the twisting rotation.

An alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation. Moving the arms back produces opposite torque which stops the twisting rotation.

===Entry===
The rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry. Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water. Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For back entries, one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called &quot;Knee save&quot;. Another is to use &quot;Pike save&quot; movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs. Knee saves are performed for back entries and Pike saves are performed for front entries.

The arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of 3m springboard, and extended forwards in line for &quot;head-first&quot; dives, which are much more common competitively. It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades. Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface. This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called &quot;rip entry&quot;).

Once a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position. Apart from aesthetic considerations, it is important from a safety point of view that divers reinforce the habit of rolling in the direction of rotation, especially for forward and inward entries. Back injuries such as hyperextension are caused by attempting to re-surface in the opposite direction. Diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries.

==By country==

===Canada===
In Canada, elite competitive diving is regulated by DPC (Diving Plongeon Canada), although the individual provinces also have organizational bodies. The main competitive season runs from February to July, although some competitions may be held in January or December, and many divers (particularly international level athletes) will train and compete year round.

Most provincial level competitions consist of events for six age groups (Groups A, B, C, D, E, and Open) for both genders on each of the three board levels. These age groups roughly correspond to those standardised by FINA, with the addition of a youngest age group for divers 9 and younger, Group E, which does not compete nationally and does not have a tower event (although divers of this age may choose to compete in Group D). The age group Open is so called because divers of any age, including those over 18, may compete in these events, so long as their dives meet a minimum standard of difficulty.

Although Canada is internationally a fairly strong country in diving, the vast majority of Canadian high schools and universities do not have diving teams, and many Canadian divers accept athletic scholarships from American colleges.

Adult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving. Typically, masters are either adults who never practised the sport as children or teenagers, or former elite athletes who have retired but still seek a way to be involved in the sport. Many diving clubs have masters teams in addition to their primary competitive ones, and while some masters dive only for fun and fitness, there are also masters competitions, which range from the local to world championship level.

====National championships====
Divers can qualify to compete at the age group national championships, or junior national championships, in their age groups as assigned by FINA up to the age of 18. This competition is held annually in July. Qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions in the season, although athletes who place very highly at a national championship will be automatically qualified to compete at the next. Divers must qualify at two different competitions, at least one of which must be a level 1 competition, i.e. a competition with fairly strict judging patterns. Such competitions include the Polar Bear Invitational in Winnipeg, the Sting in Victoria, and the Alberta Provincial Championships in Edmonton or Calgary. The qualifying scores are determined by DPC according to the results of the preceding year&#x27;s national competition, and typically do not have much variation from year to year.

Divers older than 18, or advanced divers of younger ages, can qualify for the senior national championships, which are held twice each year, once roughly in March and once in June or July. Once again, qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions (in this case, within the 12 months preceding the national championships, and in an Open age group event), or high placements in previous national championships or international competitions. It is no longer the case that divers may use results from age group events to qualify for senior nationals, or results from Open events to qualify for age group nationals.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one operational pool at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin. Other facilities with diving boards at the University of Limerick are undergoing staff training in an effort to start diving programmes.

====National championships====
National championships take place late in the year, usually during November. The competition is held at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin and consists of four events:
* Irish Open Age Group Championships
* Irish Open Junior Diving Championships
* Irish Open Senior Diving Championships
* Novice Competition (8–18 yrs)

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year. National Masters&#x27; Championships are held two or three times per year.

===United States===

====Summer diving====
In the United States, summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools. Some pools organise to form intra-pool competitions. These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school-age children.

====High school diving====
In the United States scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving (but some schools use three meter springboards.). Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team&#x27;s overall score. High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition. Depending on the state and the number of athletes competing in the state, certain qualifications must be achieved to compete in the state&#x27;s championship meet. There are often regional championships and district championships which are necessary to compete in before reaching the state meet to narrow the field to only the most competitive athletes. Most state championship meets consist of eleven dives. The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required (voluntary) dives and six optional dives.

====Club diving====
In the United States, pre-college divers interested in learning one and three meter or platform diving should consider a club sanctioned by either USA Diving or AAU Diving. In USA Diving, Future Champions is the entry level or novice diver category with eight levels of competition. From Future Champions, divers graduate to &quot;Junior Olympic&quot;, or JO. JO divers compete in age groups at inter-club competitions, at invitationals, and if qualified, at regional, zone and national competitions. Divers over the age of 19 years of age cannot compete in these events as a JO diver.

USA Diving sanctions the Winter Nationals championship with one, three meter, and platform events. In the summer USA Diving sanctions the Summer Nationals including all three events with both Junior and Senior divers. USA Diving is sanctioned by the United States Olympic Committee to select team representatives for international diving competitions including the World Championships and Olympic Games.

AAU Diving sanctions one national event per year in the summer. AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the All-American team.

====College diving====

In the United States scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving. Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team&#x27;s overall meet score. College divers interested in tower diving may compete in the NCAA separate from swim team events. NCAA Divisions II and III do not usually compete platform; if a diver wishes to compete platform in college, he or she must attend a Division I school.

Each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition. Division II schools compete with 10 dives in competition whereas Division III schools compete with 11. Division I schools only compete with 6 dives in competition. These 6 dives consist of either 5 optionals and 1 voluntary, or 6 optionals. If the meet is a 5 optional meet, then the divers will perform 1 optional from each category (Front, Back, Inward, Reverse, and Twister) and then 1 voluntary from the category of their choice. The voluntary in this type of meet is always worth a DD (Degree of Difficulty) of 2.0 even if the real DD is worth more or less on a DD sheet. In a 6 optional meet, the divers will yet again perform one dive from each category, but this time they will perform a 6th optional from the category of their choosing, which is worth its actual DD from the DD sheet.

The highest level of collegiate competition is the NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championship. Events at the championship include 1 metre springboard, 3 metre springboard, and platform, as well as various swimming individual and relay events. The points scored by swimmers and divers are combined to determine a team swimming &amp; diving champion. To qualify for a diving event at the NCAA championships, a competitor must first finish in the top three at one of five zone championships, which are held after the various conference championship meets. A diver who scores at least 310 points on the 3 metre springboard and 300 points on the 1 metre springboard in a 6 optional meet can participate in the particular zone championship corresponding to the geographic region in which his or her school lies.

A number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills. These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age-group or club diving experience.

The NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions. The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.

====Masters&#x27; Diving====
Divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in Masters&#x27; Diving programs. Masters&#x27; diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.

Masters&#x27; Diving events are normally conducted in age-groups separated by five or ten years, and attract competitors of a wide range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters&#x27; Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organised competition.

==Non-competitive diving==


Diving is also popular as a non-competitive activity. Such diving usually emphasises the airborne experience, and the height of the dive, but does not emphasise what goes on once the diver enters the water. The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training. Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater swimming.

Such non-competitive diving can occur indoors and outdoors. Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water. However, man-made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations. Outdoor diving requires knowledge of the water depth and currents as conditions can be dangerous.
On occasion, the diver will inadvertently belly flop, entering the water horizontally or nearly so. The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.

==High diving==

A recently developing section of the sport is &quot;High Diving&quot; (e.g. see 2013 World Aquatics Championships), conducted in open air locations, usually from improvised platforms up to high (as compared with as used in Olympic and World Championship events). Entry to the water is invariably feet-first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head-first entry from that height. The final half-somersault is almost always performed backwards, enabling the diver to spot the entry point and control their rotation.

Competitive high diving is run as the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.

<text>In grammar, the dative case (abbreviated , or sometimes when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used in some languages to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action, as in &quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;Maria gave Jacob a drink&quot;. In this example, the dative marks what would be considered the indirect object of a verb in English.

Sometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In Scottish Gaelic and Irish, the term &quot;dative case&quot; is used in traditional grammars to refer to the prepositional case-marking of nouns following simple prepositions and the definite article. In Georgian and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), the dative case can also mark the subject of a sentence. This is called the dative construction. In Hindi, the dative construction is not limited to only certain verbs or tenses and it can be used with any verb in any tense or mood.

The dative was common among early Indo-European languages and has survived to the present in the Balto-Slavic branch, the Germanic branch, Albanian and others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the Uralic family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In Ancient Greek, the dative has the functions of the Proto-Indo-European locative and instrumental as well as those of the original dative.

Under the influence of English, which uses the preposition &quot;to&quot; for (among other uses) both indirect objects (&quot;give to&quot;) and directions of movement (&quot;go to&quot;), the term &quot;dative&quot; has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called lative.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dative&quot; comes from Latin &quot;cāsus datīvus&quot; (&quot;case for giving&quot;), a translation of Greek δοτικὴ πτῶσις, &quot;dotikē ptôsis&quot; (&quot;inflection for giving&quot;). Dionysius Thrax in his Art of Grammar also refers to it as &quot;epistaltikḗ&quot; &quot;for sending (a letter)&quot;, from the verb &quot;epistéllō&quot; &quot;send to&quot;, a word from the same root as epistle.

==English==
The Old English language had a dative case; however, the English case system gradually fell into disuse during the Middle English period, when the accusative and dative of pronouns merged into a single oblique case that was also used with all prepositions. This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the &quot;accusative&quot; and &quot;dative&quot; labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term &quot;objective&quot; for oblique.

===Set expressions===
The dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word &quot;methinks&quot;, with the meaning &quot;it seems to me&quot;. It survives in this fixed form from Old English (having undergone, however, phonetic changes with the rest of the language), in which it was constructed as &quot;[it]&quot; + &quot;me&quot; (the dative case of the personal pronoun) + &quot;thinks&quot; (i.e., &quot;seems&quot;, &lt; Old English þyncan, &quot;to seem&quot;, a verb closely related to the verb þencan, &quot;to think&quot;, but distinct from it in Old English; later it merged with &quot;think&quot; and lost this meaning).

===Relic pronouns===
The modern objective case pronoun whom is derived from the dative case in Old English, specifically the Old English dative pronoun &quot;hwām&quot; (as opposed to the modern subjective &quot;who&quot;, which descends from Old English &quot;hwā&quot;) – though &quot;whom&quot; &quot;also&quot; absorbed the functions of the Old English accusative pronoun &quot;hwone&quot;. It is also cognate to the word &quot;&quot;wem&quot; (the dative form of &quot;wer&quot;&quot;) in German. The OED defines all classical uses of the word &quot;whom&quot; in situations where the indirect object &quot;is not known&quot; – in effect, indicating the anonymity of the indirect object.

Likewise, some of the object forms of personal pronouns are remnants of Old English datives. For example, &quot;him&quot; goes back to the Old English dative &quot;him&quot; (accusative was &quot;hine&quot;), and &quot;her&quot; goes back to the dative &quot;hire&quot; (accusative was &quot;hīe&quot;). These pronouns are not pure datives in modern English; they are also used for functions previously indicated by the accusative.

===Modern English===
The indirect object of the verb may be placed between the verb and the direct object of the verb: &quot;he gave me a book&quot; or &quot;he wrote me a poem.&quot;

The indirect object may also be expressed using a prepositional phrase using &quot;to&quot;: &quot;he gave a book to me&quot;.

==German==
In general, the dative (German: &quot;Dativ&quot;) is used to mark the indirect object of a German sentence. For example:
* (literally: I sent &quot;to the man&quot; the book.) – Masculine
* (literally: I gave &quot;to the woman&quot; the pencil back.) – Feminine
* (literally: I hand &quot;to the child&quot; a present.) – Neuter

In English, the first sentence can be rendered as &quot;I sent the book &quot;to the man&quot;&quot; and as &quot;I sent &quot;the man&quot; the book&quot;, where the indirect object is identified in English by standing in front of the direct object. The normal word order in German is to put the dative in front of the accusative (as in the example above). However, since the German dative is marked in form, it can also be put &quot;after&quot; the accusative: . The after and signifies a now largely archaic ending for certain nouns in the dative. It survives today almost exclusively in set phrases such as (at home, &quot;lit.&quot; to house), (in the course of), and (during the day, &quot;lit.&quot; at the day), as well as in occasional usage in formal prose, poetry, and song lyrics.

Some masculine nouns (and one neuter noun, [heart]), referred to as &quot;weak nouns&quot; or &quot;n-nouns&quot;, take an -n or -en in the dative singular and plural. Many are masculine nouns ending in -e in the nominative (such as [name], [officer], and [boy]), although not all such nouns follow this rule. Many also, whether or not they fall into the former category, refer to people, animals, professions, or titles; exceptions to this include the aforementioned and , as well as (letter), (peace), (obelisk), (planet), and others.

Certain German prepositions require the dative: (from), (out of), (at, near), (against), (opposite), (with), (after, to), (since), (from), and (at, in, to). Some other prepositions ( [at], [on], [along], [behind], [in, into], (beside, next to), [over, across], [under, below], [in front of], and [among, between]) may be used with dative (indicating current location), or accusative (indicating direction toward something). (dative: The book is lying on the table), but (accusative: I put the book onto the table).

In addition the four prepositions (in place of), (in spite of), (during), and (because of) which require the genitive in modern formal language, are most commonly used with the dative in colloquial German. For example, &quot;because of the weather&quot; is expressed as instead of the formally correct . Other prepositions requiring the genitive in formal language, are combined with (&quot;of&quot;) in colloquial style, e.g. instead of (&quot;outside the garden&quot;).

The concept of an indirect object may be rendered by a prepositional phrase. In this case, the noun&#x27;s or pronoun&#x27;s case is determined by the preposition, not by its function in the sentence. Consider this sentence:
* &#x27;I sent the book to the editor.&#x27;
Here, the subject, , is in the nominative case, the direct object, , is in the accusative case, and is in the dative case, since always requires the dative ( is a contraction of + ). However:
* (&quot;accusative&quot;) . &#x27;I forwarded the book to my friend.&#x27; ( = lit.: to give further).
In this sentence, is the indirect object, but, because it follows (direction), the accusative is required, not the dative.

All of the articles change in the dative case.
Some German verbs require the dative for their direct objects. Common examples are &quot;antworten&quot; (to answer), &quot;danken&quot; (to thank), &quot;gefallen&quot; (to please), &quot;folgen&quot; (to follow), &quot;glauben&quot; (to believe), &quot;helfen&quot; (to help), and &quot;raten&quot; (to advise). In each case, the direct object of the verb is rendered in the dative. For example:
*Meine Freunde helfen &quot;mir&quot;. (My friends help me.)

These verbs cannot be used in normal passive constructions, because German allows these only for verbs with accusative objects. It is therefore ungrammatical to say: *&quot;Ich werde geholfen.&quot; &quot;I am helped.&quot; Instead a special construction called &quot;impersonal passive&quot; must be used: &quot;Mir wird geholfen&quot;, literally: &quot;To me is helped.&quot; A colloquial (non-standard) way to form the passive voice for dative verbs is the following: &quot;Ich kriege geholfen&quot;, or: &quot;Ich bekomme geholfen&quot;, literally: &quot;I get helped&quot;. The use of the verb &quot;to get&quot; here reminds us that the dative case has something to do with giving and receiving. In German, help is not something you &quot;perform on&quot; somebody, but rather something you &quot;offer&quot; them.

The dative case is also used with reflexive (&quot;sich&quot;) verbs when specifying what part of the self the verb is being done to:
*Ich wasche &quot;mich&quot;. – accusative (I wash myself.)
*Ich wasche &quot;mir die Hände&quot;. – dative (I wash my hands, literally &quot;I wash for myself the hands&quot;)
Cf. the respective &quot;accord&quot; in French: &quot;&quot; (&quot;The children have washed themselves&quot;) vs. &quot; [uninflected] &quot; (&quot;... their hands&quot;).

German can use two datives to make sentences like: &quot;Sei mir meinem Sohn(e) gnädig!&quot; &quot;For my sake, have mercy on my son!&quot; Literally: &quot;Be for me to my son merciful.&quot; The first dative &quot;mir&quot; (&quot;for me&quot;) expresses the speaker&#x27;s commiseration (much like the &quot;dativus ethicus&quot; in Latin, see below). The second dative &quot;meinem Sohn(e)&quot; (&quot;to my son&quot;) names the actual object of the plea. Mercy is to be given &quot;to&quot; the son &quot;for&quot; or &quot;on behalf of&quot; his mother/father.

Adjective endings also change in the dative case. There are three inflection possibilities depending on what precedes the adjective. They most commonly use &quot;weak inflection&quot; when preceded by a definite article (the), &quot;mixed inflection&quot; after an indefinite article (a/an), and &quot;strong inflection&quot; when a quantity is indicated (many green apples).
==Latin== 

There are several uses for the dative case ():
* (dative of purpose), e.g. – &quot;[we learn] not for school, but for life&quot;, – &quot;to call for help&quot;, – &quot;I&#x27;m coming for help&quot;, – &quot;I receive [this] as a gift&quot; or – &quot;[this] is for the girl&#x27;s decoration&quot;, or &quot;... for decoration for the girl&quot; (as could be either dative or genitive)
*, which means action for (or against) somebody, e.g., – &quot;to till fields for Greeks&quot;; Combination of and (double dative): &quot;to you for joy&quot;
* (possessive dative) which means possession, e.g. – literally &quot;to (or for) the angels are wings&quot;, this is typically found with a copula and translated as &quot;angels have wings&quot;.
* (ethic dative) indicates that the person in the dative is or should be especially concerned about the action, e.g. &quot;What is Celsus doing for me?&quot; (expressing the speaker being especially interested in what Celsus is doing for him or her); or &quot;Whose interest does this serve?&quot; (literally &quot;To whom does this do good?&quot;)
*, meaning; &#x27;in the eyes of&#x27;, e.g., &#x27;he seems to me to be a good man&#x27;.
*The dative expresses agency with the gerundive when the gerundive is used to convey obligation or necessity, e.g., , &#x27;these things must be done by us.&#x27;

==Greek==

===Ancient===

In addition to its main function as the &quot;dativus&quot;, the dative case has other functions in Classical Greek: (The chart below uses the Latin names for the types of dative; the Greek name for the dative is δοτική πτῶσις, like its Latin equivalent, derived from the verb &quot;to give&quot;; in Ancient Greek, δίδωμι.)
*Dativus finalis: The &quot;dativus finalis&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of purpose&#x27;, is when the dative is used to denote &quot;the purpose&quot; of a certain action. For example:
***&quot;I fight for the king&quot;.
***&quot;I die for honour&quot;.
*Dativus commŏdi (incommodi): The &quot;dativus commodi sive incommodi&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of benefit (or harm)&#x27; is the dative that expresses the advantage or disadvantage of something &quot;for someone&quot;. For example:
**&quot;For the benefit of&quot;: &quot;&quot; (Sophocles, &quot;Ajax&quot; 1366).
***&quot;Every man toils for himself&quot;.
**&quot;For the harm or disadvantage of&quot;: &quot;&quot; (Thucydides 2.12.4).
***&quot;This day will be the beginning of great sorrows for the Greeks (i.e., for their disadvantage)&quot;.
*Dativus possessivus: The &quot;dativus possessivus&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of possession&#x27; is the dative used to denote &quot;the possessor&quot; of a certain object or objects. For example:
**&quot;&quot; (Thucycdides 1.86.3).
***&quot;For others have a lot of money and ships and horses, but we have good allies (i.e., To others there is a lot of money...)&quot;.
*Dativus ethicus: The &quot;dativus ethicus&quot;, or the &#x27;ethic or polite dative,&#x27; is when the dative is used to signify that the person or thing spoken of is regarded with interest by someone. This dative is mostly, if not exclusively, used in pronouns. As such, it is also called the &quot;dative of pronouns.&quot; For example:
**&quot;&quot; (Demosthenes 18.178).
***&quot;Pay close attention to this, I beg you (i.e., please pay..)&quot;.
**&quot;&quot; (Xenophon, &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; 18.178).
***&quot;Oh, mother, how handsome grandpa is (I&#x27;ve just realized!)&quot;.
*Dativus auctoris: The &quot;dativus auctoris&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of agent,&#x27; is the dative used to denote &quot;the doer&quot; of an action. Note, however, that in Classical Greek, the agent is usually in the genitive after (by, at the hands of). The agent is in the dative most often with the perfect and pluperfect passive, and with the verbal adjective in . For example:
**&quot;&quot; (Isocrates 8.39)
***&quot;Many cures have been discovered by doctors.&quot;
*Dativus instrumenti: The &quot;dativus instrumenti&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of instrument,&#x27; is when the dative is used to denote an instrument or means of a certain action (or, more accurately, as the instrumental case). For example:
**&quot;.&quot; (Homer, &quot;Odyssey&quot; 9.407)
***&quot;He kills me with a bait (i.e., by means of a bait).&quot;
*Dativus modi: The &quot;dativus modi&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of manner,&#x27; is the dative used to describe &quot;the manner or way&quot; by which something happened. For example:
**&quot;&quot; (Thucydides 8.84)
***&quot;having died of (from) a disease.&quot;
*Dativus mensurae: The &quot;dativus mensurae&quot;, or the &#x27;dative of measurement,&#x27; is the dative used to denote &quot;the measurement of difference&quot;. For example:
**&quot;&quot; (Plato, &quot;Phaedo&quot; 101a)
***&quot;taller by a head.&quot;
**&quot;&quot; (Plato, &quot;Laws&quot; 729d)
***&quot;by far the best.&quot;

The articles in the Greek dative are
===Modern===
The dative case, strictly speaking, no longer exists in Modern Greek, except in fossilized expressions like δόξα τω Θεώ (from the ecclesiastical τῷ Θεῷ δόξα, &quot;Glory to God&quot;) or εν τάξει (ἐν τάξει, lit. &quot;in order&quot;, i.e. &quot;all right&quot; or &quot;OK&quot;). Otherwise, most of the functions of the dative are expressed by the genitive or by prepositional phrases.

==Slavic languages==
In Russian, the dative case is used for indicating the indirect object of an action (that to which something is given, thrown, read, etc.). In the instance where a person is the goal of motion, dative is used instead of accusative to indicate motion toward. This is usually achieved with the preposition + destination in dative case; , meaning &quot;to the doctor.&quot;

Dative is also the necessary case taken by certain prepositions when expressing certain ideas. For instance, when the preposition &quot;по&quot; is used to mean &quot;along&quot;, its object is always in dative case, as in , meaning &quot;along the sides.&quot;

Other Slavic languages apply the dative case (and the other cases) more or less the same way as does Russian; some languages may use the dative in other ways. The following examples are from Polish:

*after certain verbs (dziękować komuś &quot;to thank someone&quot;, pomóc komuś &quot;to help someone&quot;, wierzyć komuś &quot;to believe someone&quot;)
*in certain expressions (Czy podoba ci się piosenka? &quot;Do you like the song?&quot;, Jest mi zimno &quot;I&#x27;m cold&quot;, Jest nam smutno &quot;We&#x27;re feeling sad&quot;, Będzie wam trudniej... &quot;It will be more difficult for you guys&quot;), Śniło jej się, że... &quot;She dreamt that&quot;
*&quot;dativus commodi&quot; to indicate action for somebody (Zbuduję temu człowiekowi dom &quot;I will build a house for this person&quot;)
*when something is taken away or something occurs to someone (Zdechł im pies &quot;Their dog died&quot;; Zabrali mu komputer &quot;They took away his computer&quot;; Zepsuł nam się samochód &quot;Our car broke down&quot;; Coś mi się przypomniało &quot;I just remembered something&quot;)

Some other kinds of dative use as found in the Serbo-Croatian language are: &quot;Dativus finalis&quot; (Titaniku u pomoć &quot;to Titanic&#x27;s rescue&quot;), &quot;Dativus commodi/incommodi&quot; (Operi svojoj majci suđe &quot;Wash the dishes for your mother&quot;), &quot;Dativus possessivus&quot; (Ovcama je dlaka gusta &quot;Sheep&#x27;s hair is thick&quot;), &quot;Dativus ethicus&quot; (Šta/što mi radi Boni? &quot;What is Boni doing? (I am especially interested in what it is)&quot;) and Dativus auctoris (Izgleda mi okej &quot;It seems okay to me&quot;).

Unusual in other Indo-European branches but common among Slavic languages, endings of nouns and adjectives are different based on grammatical function. Other factors are gender and number. In some cases, the ending may not be obvious, even when those three factors (function, gender, number) are considered. For example, in Polish, &#x27;syn&#x27; (&quot;son&quot;) and &#x27;ojciec&#x27; (&quot;father&quot;) are both masculine singular nouns, yet appear as &quot;syn → synowi and &quot;ojciec → ojcu in the dative.

==Baltic languages==
Both Lithuanian and Latvian have a distinct dative case in the system of nominal declensions.

Lithuanian nouns preserve Indo-European inflections in the dative case fairly well: (o-stems) vaikas -&gt; sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; (ā-stems) ranka -&gt; sg. rankai, pl. rankoms; (i-stems) viltis -&gt; sg. vilčiai, pl. viltims; (u-stems) sūnus -&gt; sg. sūnui, pl. sūnums; (consonant stems) vanduo -&gt; sg. vandeniui, pl. vandenims.

Adjectives in the dative case receive pronominal endings (this might be the result of a more recent development): tas geras vaikas -&gt; sg. tam geram vaikui, pl. tiems geriems vaikams.

The dative case in Latvian underwent further simplifications – the original masculine endings of &quot;both&quot; nouns and adjectives have been replaced with pronominal inflections: tas vīrs -&gt; sg. tam vīram, pl. vīriem. Also, the final &quot;s&quot; in all Dative forms has been dropped. The only exception is personal pronouns in the plural: mums (to us), jums (to you). In colloquial Lithuanian the final &quot;s&quot; in the dative is often omitted, as well: time geriem vaikam.

In both Latvian and Lithuanian, the main function of the dative case is to render the indirect object in a sentence: (lt) aš duodu vyrui knygą; (lv) es dodu [duodu] vīram grāmatu – &quot;I am giving a book to the man&quot;.

The dative case can also be used with gerundives to indicate an action preceding or simultaneous with the main action in a sentence: (lt) jam įėjus, visi atsistojo – &quot;when he walked in, everybody stood up&quot;, lit. &quot;to him having walked in, all stood up&quot;; (lt) jai miegant, visi dirbo – &quot;while she slept, everybody was working&quot;, lit. &quot;to her sleeping, all were working&quot;.

In modern standard Lithuanian, Dative case is not required by prepositions, although in many dialects it is done frequently: (dial.) iki (+D) šiai dienai, (stand.) iki (+G) šios dienos – &quot;up until this day&quot;.

In Latvian, the dative case is taken by several prepositions in the singular and all prepositions in the plural (due to peculiar historical changes): sg. bez (+G) tevis &quot;(without thee)&quot; ~ pl. bez (+D) jums &quot;(without you)&quot;; sg. pa (+A) ceļu &quot;(along the road)&quot; ~ pl. pa (+D) ceļiem &quot;(along the roads)&quot;.

==Armenian==
In modern Eastern Armenian, the dative is attained by adding any article to the genitive:

: &quot;dog&quot; = շուն
: GEN &gt; շան &quot;(of the dog; dog&#x27;s)&quot; with no articles
: DAT &gt; շանը or շանն &quot;(to the dog)&quot; with definite articles (-ն if preceding a vowel)
: DAT &gt; մի շան &quot;(to a dog)&quot; with indefinite article
: DAT &gt; շանս &quot;(to my dog)&quot; with 1st person possessive article
: DAT &gt; շանդ &quot;(to your dog)&quot; with 2nd person possessive article

There is a general tendency to view -ին as the standard dative suffix, but only because that is its most productive (and therefore common) form. The suffix -ին as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -ի accompanied by the definite article -ն. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -ին:

: Definite DAT &gt; Ես գիրքը տվեցի տղային: &quot;(I gave the book to the boy)&quot;
: Indefinite DAT&gt; Ես գիրքը տվեցի մի տղայի: &quot;(I gave the book to a boy)&quot;

The main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition &quot;to&quot;. In the use of &quot;giving&quot; verbs like &quot;give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring...&quot; the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like &quot;tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer...&quot; the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are &quot;show, reach, look, approach...&quot;

Eastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition &quot;at&quot;, as in &quot;Meet me at nine o&#x27; clock.&quot;

==Indo-Aryan languages==

=== Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) ===
Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) has true dative case for pronouns, but for nouns the dative case has to be constructed using the dative case-marker (postposition) को کو (ko) to the nouns in their oblique case. Pronouns in Hindustani also have an oblique case, so dative pronouns can also be alternatively constructed using the dative case-marker को کو (ko) with the pronouns in their oblique case, hence forming two sets of synonymous dative pronouns. The following table shows the pronouns in their nominative and their dative forms. Hindustani lacks pronouns in the third person and the demonstrative pronouns double as the third person pronouns. 

The table below shows the oblique cases of Hindustani for the nouns &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; which take in the dative case-marker after them to assign the combination of the oblique case and the case-marker the dative case. The oblique case of Hindustani by itself has no meaning and adding the case-marker को کو (ko) assigns the oblique case the function of the dative case.

Dative case in Hindustani can also mark the subject of a sentence. This is called the dative construction or quirky subjects. In the examples below the dative pronoun passes the subjecthood test of subject-oriented anaphora binding. The dative subject मुझे مجھے (&quot;mujhe&quot;) binds the anaphora अपने اپنے (&quot;apne&quot;).

=== Sanskrit ===
The dative case is known as the &quot;fourth case&quot; (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object.

puruṣo &quot;bhāryāyai&quot; dadāti — The man gives everything &quot;to his wife&quot;.

&quot;yuddhāyā&quot;gacchāmīti bhaṇati vīraḥ — The hero says, &quot;I come &quot;for battle&quot;.&quot;

The fourth case can also be used to indicate a recipient of worship.

namo &quot;buddhāya&quot; — Homage &quot;to the Buddha&quot;.

==Non-Indo-European languages==

===Hungarian===
As with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, &quot;Dánielnek adtam ezt a könyvet&quot; (I gave this book to Dániel). It has two suffixes, &quot;-nak&quot; and &quot;-nek&quot;; the correct one is selected by vowel harmony. The personal dative pronouns follow the &quot;-nek&quot; version: &quot;nekem&quot;, &quot;neked&quot;, etc. This case is also used to express &quot;for&quot; in certain circumstances, such as &quot;I bought a gift for Mother&quot;. In possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is not the dative form (rather, the attributive or possessive case)

===Finnish===

Finnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the allative case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: &quot;He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa köyhille (They donated all their money to the poor.)&quot; It is similar in Estonian&quot;.&quot;
===Tsez===
In the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the dative also takes the functions of the lative case in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb &quot;show&quot; (literally: &quot;make see&quot;) is given below:

The dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as &quot;to have&quot;.

As in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.

Verbs of perception or emotion (like &quot;see&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;want&quot;) also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case. In this example the &quot;pure&quot; dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used.

=== Turkish ===
The dative case (&quot;yönelme durumu&quot;) in the Turkish language is formed by adding the &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-a&quot; suffixes to the end of the noun, in accordance with the effected noun&#x27;s vowel harmony. The word that should be in the dative case can be found as an answer to the questions &#x27;neye?&#x27; (to what?), &#x27;kime?&#x27; (to whom?) and &#x27;nereye?&#x27; (to where?) will lead to find a dative case in a sentence. There are many different uses for the dative case.

The dative also is for objects, usually indirect objects, but sometimes objects that in English would be considered direct:

The dative case tells &quot;whither&quot;, that is, the place &quot;to which&quot;. Thus it has roughly the meaning of the English prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;into&quot;, and also &quot;in&quot; when it can be replaced with &quot;into&quot;:

<text>In geometry, a dodecahedron (; ) or duodecahedron is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces. The most familiar dodecahedron is the regular dodecahedron with regular pentagons as faces, which is a Platonic solid. There are also three regular star dodecahedra, which are constructed as stellations of the convex form. All of these have icosahedral symmetry, order 120.

Some dodecahedra have the same combinatorial structure as the regular dodecahedron (in terms of the graph formed by its vertices and edges), but their pentagonal faces are not regular:
The pyritohedron, a common crystal form in pyrite, has pyritohedral symmetry, while the tetartoid has tetrahedral symmetry.

The rhombic dodecahedron can be seen as a limiting case of the pyritohedron, and it has octahedral symmetry. The elongated dodecahedron and trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron variations, along with the rhombic dodecahedra, are space-filling. There are numerous other dodecahedra.

While the regular dodecahedron shares many features with other Platonic solids, one unique property of it is that one can start at a corner of the surface and draw an infinite number of straight lines across the figure that return to the original point without crossing over any other corner.

==Regular dodecahedron==

The convex regular dodecahedron is one of the five regular Platonic solids and can be represented by its Schläfli symbol {5, 3}.

The dual polyhedron is the regular icosahedron {3, 5}, having five equilateral triangles around each vertex.
The convex regular dodecahedron also has three stellations, all of which are regular star dodecahedra. They form three of the four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. They are the small stellated dodecahedron {5/2, 5}, the great dodecahedron {5, 5/2}, and the great stellated dodecahedron {5/2, 3}. The small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are dual to each other; the great stellated dodecahedron is dual to the great icosahedron {3, 5/2}. All of these regular star dodecahedra have regular pentagonal or pentagrammic faces. The convex regular dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron are different realisations of the same abstract regular polyhedron; the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are different realisations of another abstract regular polyhedron.

==Other pentagonal dodecahedra==
In crystallography, two important dodecahedra can occur as crystal forms in some symmetry classes of the cubic crystal system that are topologically equivalent to the regular dodecahedron but less symmetrical: the pyritohedron with pyritohedral symmetry, and the tetartoid with tetrahedral symmetry:

===Pyritohedron===
A pyritohedron is a dodecahedron with pyritohedral (Th) symmetry. Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices (see figure). However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axis. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of rotational symmetry are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.

Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral pyrite, and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular Platonic solid form. The true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for quasicrystals (such as holmium–magnesium–zinc quasicrystal) with icosahedral symmetry, which includes true fivefold rotation axes.

====Crystal pyrite====
The name &quot;crystal pyrite&quot; comes from one of the two common crystal habits shown by pyrite (the other one being the cube). In pyritohedral pyrite, the faces have a Miller index of (210), which means that the dihedral angle is 2·arctan(2) ≈ 126.87° and each pentagonal face has one angle of approximately 121.6° in between two angles of approximately 106.6° and opposite two angles of approximately 102.6°. The following formulas show the measurements for the face of a perfect crystal (which is rarely found in nature).

formula_1

formula_2

formula_3

====Cartesian coordinates====
The eight vertices of a cube have the coordinates (±1, ±1, ±1).

The coordinates of the 12 additional vertices are
(0, ±(1 + &quot;h&quot;), ±(1 − &quot;h&quot;2)), 
(±(1 + &quot;h&quot;), ±(1 − &quot;h&quot;2), 0) and
(±(1 − &quot;h&quot;2), 0, ±(1 + &quot;h&quot;)).

&quot;h&quot; is the height of the wedge-shaped &quot;roof&quot; above the faces of that cube with edge length 2.

An important case is &quot;h&quot; = (a quarter of the cube edge length) for perfect natural pyrite (also the pyritohedron in the Weaire–Phelan structure).

Another one is &quot;h&quot; = = 0.618... for the regular dodecahedron. See section &quot;Geometric freedom&quot; for other cases.

Two pyritohedra with swapped nonzero coordinates are in dual positions to each other like the dodecahedra in the compound of two dodecahedra.

====Geometric freedom====
The pyritohedron has a geometric degree of freedom with limiting cases of a cubic convex hull at one limit of collinear edges, and a rhombic dodecahedron as the other limit as 6 edges are degenerated to length zero. The regular dodecahedron represents a special intermediate case where all edges and angles are equal.

It is possible to go past these limiting cases, creating concave or nonconvex pyritohedra. The &quot;endo-dodecahedron&quot; is concave and equilateral; it can tessellate space with the convex regular dodecahedron. Continuing from there in that direction, we pass through a degenerate case where twelve vertices coincide in the centre, and on to the regular great stellated dodecahedron where all edges and angles are equal again, and the faces have been distorted into regular pentagrams. On the other side, past the rhombic dodecahedron, we get a nonconvex equilateral dodecahedron with fish-shaped self-intersecting equilateral pentagonal faces.

===Tetartoid===
A tetartoid (also tetragonal pentagonal dodecahedron, pentagon-tritetrahedron, and tetrahedric pentagon dodecahedron) is a dodecahedron with chiral tetrahedral symmetry (T). Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.

Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry. The mineral cobaltite can have this symmetry form.

Abstractions sharing the solid&#x27;s topology and symmetry can be created from the cube and the tetrahedron. In the cube each face is bisected by a slanted edge. In the tetrahedron each edge is trisected, and each of the new vertices connected to a face center. (In Conway polyhedron notation this is a gyro tetrahedron.)

====Cartesian coordinates====
The following points are vertices of a tetartoid pentagon under tetrahedral symmetry:
:(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;); (−&quot;a&quot;, −&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;); (−, −, ); (−&quot;c&quot;, −&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); (−, , ),
under the following conditions:
:&quot;n&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;c&quot; − &quot;bc&quot;2,
:&quot;d&quot;1 = &quot;a&quot;2 − &quot;ab&quot; + &quot;b&quot;2 + &quot;ac&quot; − 2&quot;bc&quot;,
:&quot;d&quot;2 = &quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;ab&quot; + &quot;b&quot;2 − &quot;ac&quot; − 2&quot;bc&quot;,

====Geometric freedom====

The regular dodecahedron is a tetartoid with more than the required symmetry. The triakis tetrahedron is a degenerate case with 12 zero-length edges. (In terms of the colors used above this means, that the white vertices and green edges are absorbed by the green vertices.)


===Dual of triangular gyrobianticupola===
A lower symmetry form of the regular dodecahedron can be constructed as the dual of a polyhedron constructed from two triangular anticupola connected base-to-base, called a &quot;triangular gyrobianticupola.&quot; It has D3d symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.

==Rhombic dodecahedron==

The &quot;rhombic dodecahedron&quot; is a zonohedron with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the quasiregular cuboctahedron (an Archimedean solid) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.

The &quot;rhombic dodecahedron&quot; can be seen as a degenerate pyritohedron where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.

The rhombic dodecahedron has several stellations, the first of which is also a parallelohedral spacefiller.

Another important rhombic dodecahedron, the Bilinski dodecahedron, has twelve faces congruent to those of the rhombic triacontahedron, i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the golden ratio. It is also a zonohedron and was described by Bilinski in 1960. This figure is another spacefiller, and can also occur in non-periodic spacefillings along with the rhombic triacontahedron, the rhombic icosahedron and rhombic hexahedra.

==Other dodecahedra==
There are 6,384,634 topologically distinct &quot;convex&quot; dodecahedra, excluding mirror images—the number of vertices ranges from 8 to 20. (Two polyhedra are &quot;topologically distinct&quot; if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)

**Truncated pentagonal trapezohedron, D5d, order 20, topologically equivalent to regular dodecahedron

==Practical usage==
Armand Spitz used a dodecahedron as the &quot;globe&quot; equivalent for his Digital Dome planetarium projector, based upon a suggestion from Albert Einstein.

Regular dodecahedrons are sometimes used as dice, when they are known as d12s, especially in games such as Dungeons and Dragons.

<doc id="8408" wikidata="Q11568" url="?curid=8408" title="Darwin, Northern Territory">
<text>Darwin (Larrakia: &quot;&quot;) is the capital city of the Northern Territory, Australia. The city has nearly 53% of the Northern Territory&#x27;s population, with 139,902 at the 2021 census. It is the smallest, wettest, and most northerly of the Australian capital cities and serves as the Top End&#x27;s regional centre.

Darwin&#x27;s proximity to Southeast Asia makes it a key link between Australia and countries such as Indonesia and Timor-Leste. The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin and extends southerly across central Australia through Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, concluding in Port Augusta, South Australia. The city is built upon a low bluff overlooking Darwin Harbour. Darwin&#x27;s suburbs begin at Lee Point in the north and stretch to Berrimah in the east. The Stuart Highway extends to Darwin&#x27;s eastern satellite city of Palmerston and its suburbs.

The Darwin region, like much of the Top End, has a tropical climate, with a wet and dry season. A period known locally as &quot;the build up&quot; leading up to Darwin&#x27;s wet season sees temperature and humidity increase. Darwin&#x27;s wet season typically arrives in late November to early December and brings with it heavy monsoonal downpours, spectacular lightning displays, and increased cyclone activity. During the dry season, the city has clear skies and mild sea breezes from the harbour.

The Larrakia people are the traditional owners of the Darwin area, and Aboriginal people are a significant proportion of the population. On 9 September 1839, sailed into Darwin Harbour during its survey of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region &quot;Port Darwin&quot; in honour of their former shipmate Charles Darwin, who had sailed with them on the ship&#x27;s previous voyage. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, but was renamed Darwin in 1911. The city has been almost entirely rebuilt four times, following devastation caused by a cyclone in 1897, another one in 1937, Japanese air raids during World War II, and Cyclone Tracy in 1974.

== History ==

=== Indigenous history ===
The Aboriginal people of the Larrakia language group are the traditional custodians and earliest known inhabitants of the greater Darwin area. Their name for the area is Garramilla, pronounced and meaning &quot;white stone&quot;, referring to the colour of rock and sea cliffs found in the area. They had trading routes with Southeast Asia (see Macassan contact with Australia) and imported goods from as far afield as South and Western Australia. Established songlines penetrated throughout the country, allowing stories and histories to be told and retold along the routes. The extent of shared songlines and history of multiple clan groups within this area is contestable.

=== Pre-20th century ===
The Dutch visited Australia&#x27;s northern coastline in the 1600s and landed on the Tiwi Islands only to be attacked by the Tiwi peoples. The Dutch created the first European maps of the area. This accounts for the Dutch names in the area, such as Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt. During this period, Dutch explorers named the region around Darwin—sometimes including nearby Kimberley—variations of &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;, after the VOC governor-general Anthony van Diemen. This should not be confused with the more general and prolonged use of the same name for Tasmania.

The first Briton to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of on 9 September 1839. The ship&#x27;s captain, Commander John Clements Wickham, named the port after Charles Darwin, the British naturalist who had sailed with him when he served as first lieutenant on the earlier second expedition of the &quot;Beagle&quot;.

In 1863, the Northern Territory was transferred from New South Wales to South Australia. In 1864 South Australia sent B. T. Finniss north as Government Resident to survey and found a capital for its new territory. Finniss chose a site at Escape Cliffs, near the entrance to Adelaide River, about northeast of the modern city. This attempt was short-lived, and the settlement abandoned by 1865. On 5 February 1869, George Goyder, the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin between Fort Hill and the escarpment. Goyder named the settlement Palmerston after British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1870, the first poles for the Overland Telegraph were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold by employees of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line digging holes for telegraph poles at Pine Creek in the 1880s spawned a gold rush, which further boosted the colony&#x27;s development.

In February 1872 the brigantine &quot;Alexandra&quot; was the first private vessel to sail from an English port directly to Darwin, carrying people many of whom were coming to recent gold finds.

In early 1875 Darwin&#x27;s white population had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the left Darwin &quot;en route&quot; for Adelaide. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first furlough, and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the &quot;Gothenburg&quot; encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the Great Barrier Reef. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents, and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.

In the 1870s, relatively large numbers of Chinese settled at least temporarily in the Northern Territory; many were contracted to work the goldfields and later to build the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway. By 1888 there were 6,122 Chinese in the Northern Territory, mostly in or around Darwin. The early Chinese settlers were mainly from Guangdong Province. The Chinese community established Darwin Chinatown. At the end of the 19th century, anti-Chinese feelings grew in response to the 1890s economic depression, and the White Australia policy meant many Chinese left the territory. But some stayed, became British subjects, and established a commercial base in Darwin.

===Early 20th century===

The Northern Territory was initially settled and administered by South Australia, until its transfer to the Commonwealth in 1911. In the same year, the city&#x27;s official name changed from Palmerston to Darwin.
The period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by Harold Nelson, some 1,000 demonstrators marched to Government House at Liberty Square in Darwin, where they burnt an effigy of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, John Gilruth, and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the Darwin Rebellion. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: Vestey&#x27;s Meatworks and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterward.

On 18 October 1918, during the Spanish flu pandemic, the SS &quot;Mataram&quot; sailing from Singapore with infectious diseases arrived in Darwin.

In 1931, the 17 remaining patients from the leprosarium at Cossack, Western Australia were moved to Darwin, after it closed down. It was at a time when many Aboriginal people who were thought to have leprosy or other infectious diseases were sent to lock hospitals and leprosariums under the &quot;Aborigines Act 1905&quot;, which gave the Chief Protector of Aborigines powers to arrest and send any Indigenous person suspected of having a range of diseases to one of these institutions.

Around 10,000 Australian and other Allied troops arrived in Darwin at the outset of World War II to defend Australia&#x27;s northern coast. On 19 February 1942 at 9:57am, 188 Japanese warplanes attacked Darwin in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed Pearl Harbor, though considerably more bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town, airfields, and aircraft. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of many raids on Darwin.

Darwin Chinatown which lay within the heart of Darwin was razed to the ground by the Japanese bombing and was never rebuilt. Northern Territory administrator Aubrey Abbott wanted to eliminate the Chinese community and forcibly seized their land as it was considered prime real estate.

Darwin was further developed after the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to Alice Springs to the south and Mount Isa to the southeast, and Manton Dam built in the south to provide the city with water. On Australia Day (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.

===1970–present===

On 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by Cyclone Tracy, which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the city&#x27;s buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces the winds generated. After the disaster, 30,000 of the population of 46,000 were evacuated in the biggest airlift in Australia&#x27;s history. The town was rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former Brisbane Lord mayor Clem Jones. A satellite city of Palmerston was built east of Darwin in the early 1980s.

On 17 September 2003, the Adelaide–Darwin railway was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs–Darwin standard gauge line.

=== Aviation history ===

Darwin hosted many of aviation&#x27;s early pioneers. On 10 December 1919, Captain Ross Smith and his crew landed in Darwin and won a £10,000 prize from the Australian government for completing the first flight from London to Australia in under 30 days. Smith and his crew flew a Vickers Vimy, G-EAOU, and landed on an airstrip that has become Ross Smith Avenue.

Other aviation pioneers include Amy Johnson, Amelia Earhart, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and Bert Hinkler. The original QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd Hangar, a registered heritage site, was part of the original Darwin Civil Aerodrome in Parap and is now a museum that still bears scars from the bombing of Darwin during World War II.

Darwin was home to Australian and U.S. pilots during the war, with airstrips built in and around Darwin. Today Darwin provides a staging ground for military exercises.

Darwin was a compulsory stopover and checkpoint in the London-to-Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. The official name of the race was the MacRobertson Air Race. Winners of the race were Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott.

The following is an excerpt from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, 29 October 1934:

The Darwin Aviation Museum is about from the city centre on the Stuart Highway and is one of only three places outside the United States where a B-52 bomber (on permanent loan from the United States Air Force) is on public display.

== Geography ==

Darwin is a coastal city, situated along the western shoreline of the Northern Territory. The water meets the land from the Beagle Gulf, which extends out into the Timor Sea. The central business district occupies a low bluff overlooking Darwin Harbour to the south, beyond which lie East Arm, Middle Arm, Northern Territory, and, across the gulf, West Arm. Middle Arm has an industrial precinct on the peninsula, which is being promoted as a sustainable development area that will include plants for industries such as low-emission petrochemicals, renewable hydrogen, and carbon capture storage. The city is flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west.

The rest of the city is relatively flat and low-lying, and areas bordering the coast are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.

=== City and suburbs ===

Darwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older southwestern suburbs—and the city itself—forming one corner, the newer northern suburbs another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.

The older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by Darwin International Airport and RAAF Base Darwin. Palmerston is a satellite city east of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of Australia&#x27;s fastest-growing municipalities. Darwin&#x27;s rural areas, including Howard Springs, Humpty Doo and Berry Springs, are experiencing strong growth.

Darwin&#x27;s central business district (CBD) is bounded by Daly Street in the northwest, McMinn Street in the northeast, Mitchell Street on the southwest, and Bennett Street on the southeast. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, such as the billion-dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area, including a convention centre with seating for 1,500 people and approximately of exhibition space. The developers announced that this includes hotels, residential apartments, and public space. The city&#x27;s main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway toward Palmerston, centred on Winnellie. The area&#x27;a largest shopping precinct is Casuarina Square.

The most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as the marina of Cullen Bay, Larrakeyah, Bayview and Brinkin. These low-lying regions are at risk during cyclones and higher tides, but adequate drainage and stringent building regulations have reduced the potential damage to buildings or injury to residents. The inner northern suburbs are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area. The suburb of Lyons was part of a multi-stage land release and development in the Northern Suburbs; planning, development and construction took place from 2004 to 2009. More recent developments near Lyons subdivision includes the suburb of Muirhead.

=== Climate ===

Darwin has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) with distinct wet and dry seasons, and the average maximum temperature is similar year round. The Australian Building Codes Board classifies it as Climate Zone 1. The NCC Climate zones are a broad classification of climate zones by the NCC ranging from one to eight, categorising the different climates of Australia. The dry season runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is sunny, and afternoon relative humidity averages around 30%.

The driest period of the year, seeing about of monthly rainfall on average, is between May and September. In the coolest months, June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as , but very rarely lower, and a temperature lower than has never been recorded in the city centre. Outer suburbs away from the coast occasionally record temperatures as low as in the dry season. For a 147‑day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in Northern Australia (particularly in the Northern Territory and northern regions of Western Australia), although a no-rainfall event of this extent is rare. The 3pm dewpoint average in the wet season is around .

Extreme temperatures at the Darwin Post Office Station have ranged from on 17 October 1892 to on 25 June 1891; extreme temperatures at the Darwin Airport station (which is farther from the coast and routinely records cooler temperatures than the post office station, which is in Darwin&#x27;s CBD) have ranged from on 18 October 1982 to on 29 July 1942. The highest minimum temperature on record is on 18 January 1928 for the post office station and on both 25 November 1987 and 17 December 2014 for the airport station. The lowest maximum temperature on record is on 3 June 1904 for the post office station and on 14 July 1968 for the airport station.

The wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. Most rainfall occurs between December and March (the summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months. It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days have plentiful cloud cover; January averages under six hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin&#x27;s highest daily rainfall verified by the Bureau of Meteorology is , which fell when Cyclone Carlos bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011. February 2011 was also Darwin&#x27;s wettest month ever recorded, with at the airport.

The hottest months are October and November, just before the onset of the main rain season. The temperature is usually below , but the heat index sometimes rises above , because of humidity levels that most find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second-highest average daily hours of sunshine (8.4) of any Australian capital, with the most sunshine from April to November; only Perth, Western Australia, averages more (8.8). The sun passes directly overhead in mid-October and mid-February.

The average temperature of the sea ranges from in July to in December.

Darwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in Australia. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning squall line produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a radius of Darwin alone—about three times the amount of lightning that Perth experiences on average in an entire year.


== Demographics ==
===Ancestry and immigration===

Darwin&#x27;s population changed after the Second World War. Like many other Australian cities, Darwin experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of Italians and Greeks during the 1960s and 1970s. It also began to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the Dutch, Germans, and many others. A significant proportion of Darwin&#x27;s residents are recent immigrants from Asia, including the peoples of East Timor.
At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
38.3% of the population at the 2016 census was born overseas. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from the Philippines (3.6%), England (3.1%), New Zealand (2.1%), India (2%) and Greece (0.9%).

8.7% of the population, or 11,960 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and/or Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016. This is the largest proportion of any Australian capital city.

===Language===
At the 2016 census, 58% of the population spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home include Tagalog (3.7%), Greek (3.5%), Mandarin (2.0%), Nepali (1.2%), Indonesian (1.0%), Australian Aboriginal languages (1.0%), Malayalam (0.9%), Vietnamese (0.8%), Cantonese (0.7%), Italian (0.6%), Portuguese (0.5%, mostly spoken by Timorese), and Tamil (0.5%).

===Age===
In 2011, the Darwin population averaged 33 years old (compared to the national average of around 37), to a large extent because of the military presence and because many people opt to retire elsewhere.
=== Religion ===
As of 2021, 41.7% of Darwin had no religion, so described. The largest religious denomination was Roman Catholicism (18.2%) and Anglican (5.2%).

== Law and government ==

The Darwin City Council (incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the City of Darwin, which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The city has been governed by a city council form of government since 1957. The council consists of 13 elected members, the lord mayor, and 12 aldermen.

The City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three aldermen. Constituents of all wards are directly responsible for electing the Lord Mayor of Darwin. Since the August 2017 council elections, the mayor has been Kon Vatskalis.

The rest of the Darwin area is divided into two local government areas—the Palmerston City Council and the Shire of Coomalie. These areas have elected councils that are responsible for functions delegated to them by the Northern Territory Government, such as planning and garbage collection.

The Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory Parliament House. Government House, the official residence of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, is on the Esplanade.

Darwin is split between nine electoral divisions in the Legislative Assembly—Port Darwin, Fannie Bay, Fong Lim, Nightcliff, Sanderson, Johnston, Casuarina, Wanguri, and Karama. Historically, Darwin voters elected Country Liberal Party members, but since the turn of the 21st century, voters have often selected Labor members, particularly in the more diverse northern section; as of the 2020 Northern Territory general election, all of Darwin&#x27;s nine Legislative Assembly electoral divisions are held by Labor, with Labor also holding both the Northern Territory&#x27;s federal electorates, Solomon and Lingiari.

Also on the Esplanade is the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Darwin has a Magistrate&#x27;s Court on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett streets, close to the Darwin City Council Chambers.

=== Crime ===

Darwin&#x27;s police force are members of the Northern Territory Police, under the NT Police Darwin Metropolitan Command. The Darwin urban centre includes Darwin City and the associated suburbs from Buffalo Creek, Berrimah, and East Arm westwards, representing around 35% of the Northern Territory&#x27;s population. Palmerston urban centre closely approximates the Palmerston Local Government Area, and represents approximately 13% of the Northern Territory&#x27;s population.

Darwin has had a history of alcohol abuse and violent crime, with 6,000 assaults in 2009, of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses—more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital.

Mitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, clubs and other entertainment venues, was one of the areas policed by the CitySafe Unit, officially launched by the NT Chief Minister Paul Henderson on 25 February 2009. It was credited with success in tackling alcohol abuse linked to crime, and the NT police were looking at establishing a specialist licensing enforcement unit in 2010.

The First Response Patrol, run by Larrakia Nation, which helps move homeless Indigenous women out of dangerous situations, was credited with the decline in sexual assaults in 2009. The service operates every day from 5am to 2am.

===Recent trends===
In the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the alcohol floor price and various other measures were imposed by the NT government following the Riley Review, and 31 July 2019, alcohol-related assaults dropped by 16% and domestic violence by 9% in the Darwin area.

The rate of offending in most categories of crime dropped in the Darwin urban area between 2018 and 2019, with the notable exceptions of motor vehicle theft and break-ins (both up about 12%). Apart from sexual assault, which rose from 21 to 46, all other categories of crime declined in Palmerston.

== Economy ==

The two largest economic sectors are mining and tourism. Given its location, Darwin serves as a gateway for Australian travellers to Asia.

Mining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5 billion per annum. The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc, and bauxite, along with manganese and many others. The energy production is mostly off-shore with oil and natural gas from the Timor Sea, although there are significant uranium deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents and is expected to grow as domestic and international tourists now spend time in Darwin during the wet and dry seasons. Federal spending is also a major contributor to the local economy.
Darwin&#x27;s importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with Asia. During 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including Outrigger Pandanas and Evolution on Gardiner, retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The Chinatown project has also started with plans to construct Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is one of Darwin&#x27;s largest industries and a major employment sector for the Northern Territory. In 2005–2006, 1.38 million people visited the Northern Territory. They stayed for 9.2 million nights and spent over $1.5 billion. The tourism industry directly employed 8,391 Territorians in June 2006, and, when indirect employment is included, tourism typically accounts for more than 14,000 jobs across the Territory.

Darwin is a hub for tours to Kakadu National Park, Litchfield National Park and Katherine Gorge. The year is traditionally divided into the wet and dry seasons, but there are up to six traditional seasons in Darwin. It is warm and sunny from May to September. Humidity rises during the green season, from October to April, bringing thunderstorms and monsoonal rains that rejuvenate the landscape. Tourism is largely seasonal, with most tourists visiting during the cooler dry season, from April to September.

=== Military ===

The military presence in both Darwin and the wider Northern Territory is a substantial source of employment. On 16 November 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and President Barack Obama announced that the United States would station troops in Australia for the first time since World War II. The agreement between the U.S. and Australia would involve a contingent of 250 Marines arriving in Darwin in 2012, with the total number rising to a maximum of 2,500 troops by 2017 on six-month rotations as well as a supporting air element including F-22 Raptors, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and KC-135 refuellers. China and Indonesia have expressed concern about the decision. Some analysts have argued that an expanded U.S. presence could pose a threat to security. Gillard announced that the first 200 U.S. Marines had arrived in Darwin from Hawaii on 3 April 2012. In 2013, further news of other expansion vectors aired in U.S. media, with no comment or confirmation from Australian authorities. The agreement between the two governments remains hidden from public scrutiny. Marine numbers based in Darwin increased to more than 1,150 by 2014. In a 2019 telephone survey of local residents, 51% of respondents had positive feelings about the U.S. troop presence, with 6% responding negatively. In late 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense signed a contract to create a fuel storage facility at East Arm.

Darwin hosts biennial multi-nation exercises named &quot;Pitch Black&quot;; in 2014 this involved military personnel from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

== Education ==

Education is overseen territory-wide by the Department of Education and Training (DET), whose role is to continually improve education outcomes for all students, with a focus on Indigenous students.

=== Preschool, primary and secondary ===
Darwin is served by a number of public and private schools that cater to local and overseas students. Over 16,500 primary and secondary students are enrolled in schools in Darwin, with 10,524 students attending primary education, and 5,932 students attending secondary education. Over 12,089 students are enrolled in government schools, and 2,124 in independent schools.

There were 9,764 students attending schools in the City of Darwin area. 6,045 students attended primary schools and 3,719 attended secondary schools. Over 7,161 students are enrolled in government schools and 1,108 in independent schools. There are over 35 primary and pre-schools and 12 secondary schools, including both government and non-government. Most schools in the city are secular, but there are a small number of Catholic and Lutheran institutions. Students intending to complete their secondary education work toward either the Northern Territory Certificate of Education, the Victorian Certificate of Education, or the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (the latter two are offered only at Haileybury Rendall School). Until the sale and restructuring of Kormilda College in 2018, it was the only school to offer the International Baccalaureate in the Northern Territory.

Schools have been restructured into Primary, Middle, and High schools since the beginning of 2007.

=== Tertiary and vocational ===
Darwin&#x27;s largest university is Charles Darwin University, the Northern Territory&#x27;s central provider of tertiary education. It has both vocational and academic courses, acting as both a university and an Institute of TAFE. More than 5,500 students are enrolled in tertiary and further education courses.

Darwin is also home to several private vocational colleges, including Alana Kaye College and Latitude College.

== Architecture ==

As Darwin was destroyed by cyclones several times and suffered severe bomb damage during World War II, few historic buildings remain in town. The Administrator&#x27;s Office dating from 1883 was used as a law court and as a police station and was only slightly damaged by bombs, but in 1974, the cyclone completely destroyed it. In 1979, it was decided to rebuild, and the reconstruction was finished in 1981. The building houses government offices today. Opposite the building, Survivors Lookout offers a view of the marina.In a park in the south of the CBD, the ruin of the Town Hall built in 1883 and destroyed by the cyclone in 1974 can be seen. Browns Mart is a stone building dating from 1880 opposite the park. Browns Mart was originally used in many different activities including commerce, storage, shipping and insurance agency, mining exchange and meetings of local organisations but it was transformed into a theatre.

One of Darwin&#x27;s most prominent buildings is the Chinese Temple, which was founded in 1887 and damaged by cyclones in 1897 and in 1937. It was severely damaged by bombs in 1942 and rebuilt after the war. On 24 December 1974 the cyclone completely destroyed it. Reconstruction was completed in 1978.

There are various modern churches in Darwin. St Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Cathedral was inaugurated in 1962. Christ Church Anglican Cathedral was rebuilt in 1977 after being severely damaged by bombs in 1942 and destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The Uniting Memorial Church was built in 1960.

== Events and festivals ==
*The annual Darwin Fringe Festival runs for 10 days each July as an open-access festival.
*The Darwin Festival occurs each August, and includes comedy, dance, theatre, music, film and visual art, and the NT Indigenous Music Awards.
*The Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival, which started in 2005, is held on the second week of May in the suburb of Nightcliff. It showcases local talent, and a popular event is Saturday family festivities along the Nightcliff foreshore, one of Darwin&#x27;s most popular fitness tracks.
*The Darwin beer-can regatta, held in August, celebrates Darwin&#x27;s love affair with beer, and contestants race boats made of beer cans. Also in Darwin during August are the Darwin Cup horse race and the rodeo and Mud Crab Tying Competition.
*The World Solar Challenge race attracts teams from around the world, most fielded by universities or corporations and some by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987.
*The Royal Darwin Show is held annually in July at the Darwin Showgrounds. Exhibitions include agriculture and livestock, and horse events. Entertainment and sideshows are also included over the three days of the event.
*The Darwin Street Art Festival is an annual event in September where street artists from around the world create large outdoor murals.
*A yearly music festival, BASSINTHEGRASS, has been held since 2003. Since 2019 it has been held at Mindil Beach.
*On 1 July, Territorians celebrate Territory Day. This is the only day of the year, apart from the Chinese New Year and New Year&#x27;s Eve, that fireworks are permitted. In Darwin, the main celebrations occur at Mindil Beach, where the government commissions a large firework display.
*Other festivals include the Glenti, which showcases Darwin&#x27;s large Greek community, and India@Mindil, a similar festival held by the city&#x27;s Indian community. The Chinese New Year is also celebrated with great festivity, highlighting the East Asian influence in Darwin.

== Arts and culture ==

The Darwin Symphony Orchestra was assembled in 1989 and has performed throughout the Territory. The Darwin Theatre Company is a locally produced professional theatre production company, performing locally and nationally.

The Darwin Entertainment Centre is the city&#x27;s main concert venue and hosts theatre and orchestral performances. Other theatres include the Darwin Convention Centre, which opened in July 2008. The Darwin Convention Centre is part of the $1.1 billion Darwin Waterfront project.

The Northern Territory Museum and Art Gallery (MAGNT) in Darwin gives an overview of the history of the area, including exhibits on Cyclone Tracy and the boats of the Pacific Islands. The MAGNT also organises the annual Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, the longest-running Indigenous art award in Australia. The MAGNT also manages the &quot;Defence of Darwin Experience&quot;, a multi-media installation that tells the story of the Japanese air raids on Darwin during World War II.

The NT Dance Company is led by choreographer Gary Lang, who has been artistic director since 2012. Lang previously taught at many leading dance companies, including Bangarra Dance Theatre, after studying dance at NAISDA in Sydney and working as a dancer for years. The company has a strong focus on culture, and also works with disadvantaged young Indigenous people.

Local and visiting bands can be heard at venues including the Darwin Entertainment Centre, The Vic Hotel, Happy Yess, and Brown&#x27;s Mart. Artists such as Jessica Mauboy and The Groovesmiths call Darwin home.

The multiculturalism of Darwin has helped make Southeast Asian noodle broth laksa the city&#x27;s favourite meal.

==Other entertainment==

Weekly markets include the popular Mindil Beach Sunset Market (Thursdays and Sundays during the dry season); Parap Market; Nightcliff Market; and Rapid Creek market.

Darwin&#x27;s only casino opened in 1979 as the Don Casino, operating out of the Don Hotel on Cavenagh Street. The present site of the hotel and casino on Darwin&#x27;s Mindil Beach opened in 1983, at which point gambling operations ceased at the Don Hotel and resumed at the newly built facilities. The new hotel and casino was named Mindil Beach Casino until 1985, when the name changed to the Diamond Beach Hotel Casino. Upon its acquisition by MGM Grand the hotel was rebranded as the MGM Grand Darwin, before it changed to Skycity Darwin after Skycity Entertainment Group purchased the hotel in 2004.

Mitchell Street in the central business district is lined with nightclubs, takeaways, and restaurants. This is the city&#x27;s entertainment hub. There are several smaller theatres, two cinema complexes (Casuarina, and Palmerston), and the Deckchair Cinema. An open-air cinema operates through the dry season, from April to October, screening independent and arthouse films.

==Recreation==
=== Beaches ===

During the months of October–May the sea contains deadly box jellyfish, known locally as stingers or sea wasps. Saltwater crocodiles are common in all waterways surrounding Darwin and are occasionally found in Darwin Harbour and on local beaches. An active trapping program is carried out by the NT Government to limit numbers of crocodiles within the Darwin urban waterway area.

The city has many kilometres of beaches, including the Casuarina Beach and renowned Mindil Beach, home of the Mindil Beach markets. Darwin City Council has designated an area of Casuarina Beach as a free beach, which has been designated as a nudist beach area since 1976.

Bundilla Beach was formerly named Vesteys Beach, as it was one of the beaches overlooked by Vestey&#x27;s Meatworks, which existed from 1914 to 1920 and was involved in the Darwin rebellion. In March 2021, the beach was formally renamed Bundilla Beach, the name by which it had long been known to the traditional owners, the Larrakia people.

The Darwin Surf Life Saving Club operates longboats and surf skis and provides events and lifesaving accreditations.

Lake Alexander is a man-made swimming lake at East Point Reserve.

===Fishing===
Fishing is a popular recreation among Darwin locals. Visitors fish for the barramundi, an iconic fish in the region. This fish thrives in the Daly River, Moyle River, Roper River, Anson Bay, Mary River, and South and East Alligator River.

Blue-water fishing is also available off the coast of Darwin; Spanish mackerel, black jewfish, queenfish, and snapper are found in the area.

=== Parks and gardens ===
Darwin has extensive parks and gardens. These include the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens, East Point Reserve, Casuarina Coastal Reserve, Charles Darwin National Park, Knuckey Lagoons Conservation Reserve, Leanyer Recreation Park, the Nightcliff Foreshore, Bicentennial Park and the Jingili Water Gardens.

=== Wildlife ===
Darwin is a popular bird-watching site, with locations such as the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens, East Point Reserve, Buffalo Creek, Leanyer Ponds, and Knuckey Lagoon. Slightly further from the city is one of the best birding sites in the country, Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve.

Some species of native mammals are more abundant in Darwin than in the surrounding native forest and woodland ecosystems of the region, including the common brushtail possum and black-footed tree-rat. This is likely due to the presence of well-watered gardens and parks, the absence of frequent fires, and the availability of denning sites (e.g. the roofs of houses).

Darwin is also home to many species of frogs and reptiles. There are more species of snake in Darwin than any other Australian capital city, with 34 non-marine snake species found in the region, of which 23 have been recorded by professional snake catchers in Darwin itself. Fortunately for the citizens of Darwin, a far smaller proportion of these snakes are highly venomous than is typically found in other cities, due to the low numbers of front-fanged elapid species and dominance of relatively harmless pythons and colubrid species. Of the 23 more regularly encountered snake species in Darwin, it seems that species with broader habitat and dietary preferences, as well as a penchant for arboreality, are associated with more frequent human–snake interactions. Shifts in snake behaviour or movement also occur throughout the year, with species specific differences in abundance and occurrence in certain months.

== Sports ==
The Marrara Sports Complex near the airport has stadiums for Australian rules (TIO Stadium), cricket, rugby league, football, basketball (and indoor court sports), athletics and field hockey. Every two years since 1991 (excluding 2003 due to the SARS outbreak), Darwin has hosted the Arafura Games, a major regional sporting event. In July 2003, the city hosted its first international test cricket match between Australia and Bangladesh, followed by Australia and Sri Lanka in 2004.

Australian rules is played all year round and the Territory&#x27;s premier league competition, the Northern Territory Football League is based in Darwin. Australian Football League clubs generally sell a handful of games to the Northern Territory each year, some of which are played at Marrara Oval. Darwin is part of a bid for a Northern Territory AFL license for proposed entry into the competition by 2028 at the earliest. The Darwin-based Indigenous All-Stars have participated in the AFL pre-season competition. In 2003, a record crowd of 17,500 attended a pre-season game between the All-Stars and Carlton Football Club at Marrara.

Rugby League and Rugby Union club competitions are played in Darwin each year, organised by the NTRL and NTRU respectively. The Darwin Hottest Sevens in the World tournament is hosted in Darwin each January, with Rugby Sevens club teams from countries including Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, and Singapore competing. Darwin&#x27;s Hottest 7s is the richest Rugby 7s tournament in the Southern Hemisphere.

Darwin hosts a round of the Supercars Championship every year, bringing thousands of motorsports fans to the Hidden Valley Raceway. Also in Hidden Valley, adjacent to the road-racing circuit, is Darwin&#x27;s dirt track racing venue, Northline Speedway. The speedway has hosted a number of Australian Championships over the years for different categories including Sprintcars, Speedcars, and Super Sedans.

The Darwin Cup culminating on the first Monday of August is a popular horse race event for Darwin and draws large crowds every year to Fannie Bay Racecourse. While it is not as popular as the Melbourne Cup, it does draw a crowd and, in 2003, Sky Racing began televising most of the races.

== Transport ==
The Territory&#x27;s public transport services are managed by the Department of Lands and Planning, Public Transport Division. Darwin has a bus network serviced by a range of contracted bus operators, which provides transport to the main suburbs of Darwin.

Darwin has no commuter rail system, but long-distance passenger rail services do operate out of the city. The Alice Springs-Darwin railway line was completed in 2003, linking Darwin to Adelaide. The first service ran in 2004. &quot;The Ghan&quot; passenger train service between Adelaide and Darwin railway station via Alice Springs and Katherine runs once per week in each direction, with some exceptions. 
Historically, the North Australia Railway carried passengers and freight from Darwin into the interior, reaching Pine Creek in 1889, Katherine in 1917, and Birdum in 1929. It was closed due to declining traffic in 1976.
Darwin International Airport, in the suburb of Eaton, is Darwin&#x27;s only airport, which shares its runways with the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s RAAF Base Darwin.

Darwin can be reached via the Stuart Highway, which runs the length of the Northern Territory from Darwin through Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs, and on to Adelaide. Other major roads in Darwin include Tiger Brennan Drive, Amy Johnson Avenue, Dick Ward Drive, Bagot Road, Trower Road, and McMillans Road. Bus service in the greater Darwin area is provided by Darwinbus.

===Port===

Ferries leave from Port Darwin to island locations, mainly for tourists. A ferry service to the Tiwi Islands, the &quot;Arafura Pearl&quot;, operates from Cullen Bay.

Darwin has a deepwater port, East Arm Wharf, which opened in 2000. It has of wharf line and is capable of handling Panamax-sized ships of a maximum length of and a DWT of up to .

== Infrastructure ==
=== Health ===
The Government of the Northern Territory Department of Health and Families oversees one public hospital in the Darwin metropolitan region. The Royal Darwin Hospital, in Tiwi, is the city&#x27;s major teaching and referral hospital, and the largest in the Northern Territory.

There is one major private hospital, Darwin Private Hospital, in Tiwi, adjacent to the Royal Darwin Hospital. Darwin Private Hospital is operated and owned by Healthscope Ltd, a private hospital corporation.

A new hospital called Palmerston Regional Hospital was opened in August 2018 to help ease the pressure of patient numbers at the Royal Darwin Hospital.

=== Utilities ===
Water storage, supply and power for Darwin is managed by PowerWater. The corporation is also responsible for management of sewage and the major water catchments in the region. Water is mainly stored in the largest dam, The Darwin River Dam, which holds up to 90% of Darwin&#x27;s water supply. For many years, Darwin&#x27;s principal water supply came from Manton Dam.

Darwin and its suburbs, Palmerston and Katherine, are powered by the Channel Island Power Station, the Northern Territory&#x27;s largest power plant, and the Weddell Power Station.

=== Telecommunications ===
Darwin once had Australia&#x27;s only international connection to the outside world in the form of an overseas telegraph cable, connecting Darwin to Java. The southern section of the cable connected Darwin with Adelaide and was known as the overland telegraph line. In 2022, the Northern Territory Government announced that an international undersea cable system would land into Darwin, directly connecting it to Indonesia, Singapore, the United States and Timor Leste. The new cable system, representing an investment of $700 million, is expected to create a new digital economy as it is coupled with recent announcements on Data Centre Investment into Darwin. The plans for Darwin for Data Centres and International cables are outlined in the Northern Territory&#x27;s Digital Strategy the Terabit Territory.

<text>A dictator is a political leader who possesses absolute power. A dictatorship is a state ruled by one dictator or by a polity. The word originated as the title of a Roman dictator elected by the Roman Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency. Like the terms &quot;tyrant&quot; and &quot;autocrat&quot;, &quot;dictator&quot; came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive rule. In modern usage the term &quot;dictator&quot; is generally used to describe a leader who holds or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power. 

Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of elections and civil liberties; proclamation of a state of emergency; rule by decree; repression of political opponents; not abiding by the procedures of the rule of law; and the existence of a cult of personality centered on the leader. Dictatorships are often one-party or dominant-party states. A wide variety of leaders coming to power in different kinds of regimes, such as one-party or dominant-party states and civilian governments under a personal rule, have been described as dictators.
== Etymology ==

The word &quot;dictator&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;dictātor&quot;, agent noun from &quot;dictare&quot; (say repeatedly, assert, order). A dictator was a Roman magistrate given sole power for a limited duration. Originally an emergency legal appointment in the Roman Republic and the Etruscan culture, the term &quot;dictator&quot; did not have the negative meaning it has now. It started to get its modern negative meaning with Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s ascension to the dictatorship following Sulla&#x27;s civil war, making himself the first Dictator in Rome in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as &quot;de facto&quot; eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation.

He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. Julius Caesar followed Sulla&#x27;s example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed , &quot;Dictator in perpetuity&quot;, officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until his assassination the following month. Following Caesar&#x27;s assassination, his heir Augustus was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.

== Modern era ==
As late as the second half of the 19th century, the term &quot;dictator&quot; had occasional positive implications. For example, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the national leader Lajos Kossuth was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president. When creating a provisional executive in Sicily during the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi officially assumed the title of &quot;dictator&quot; (see Dictatorship of Garibaldi). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 January uprising in Poland, &quot;Dictator&quot; was also the official title of four leaders, the first being Ludwik Mierosławski.

Past that time, however, the term &quot;dictator&quot; assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a &quot;dictatorship&quot; is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with . Many dictators create a cult of personality around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, Idi Amin Dada, who had been a British army lieutenant prior to Uganda&#x27;s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself &quot;His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular&quot;. In the movie &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940), Charlie Chaplin satirized not only Adolf Hitler but the institution of dictatorship itself.

=== Characteristics ===
==== Benevolent dictatorship ====

A benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with regard for the benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator. A benevolent dictator may allow for some civil liberties or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referendums or elected representatives with limited power, and often makes preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term. The label has been applied to leaders such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey (1923–38), Josip Broz Tito of SFR Yugoslavia (1953–80), and Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore (1959–90).

==== Military roles ====

The association between a dictator and the military is a common one. Many dictators take great pains to emphasize their connections with the military and they often wear military uniforms. In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; for instance, Francisco Franco was a general in the Spanish Army before he became Chief of State of Spain, and Manuel Noriega was officially commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.

==== Crowd manipulation ====
Some dictators have been masters of crowd manipulation, such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Joseph Stalin and Francisco Franco. Typically, the dictator&#x27;s people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of propaganda daily, often built around a cult of personality.

Mussolini and Hitler used similar, modest titles referring to them as &quot;the Leader&quot;. Mussolini used &quot;Il Duce&quot; and Hitler was generally referred to as &quot;der Führer&quot;, both meaning &#x27;Leader&#x27; in Italian and German respectively. Franco used a similar title, &quot;El Caudillo&quot; (&quot;the Head&quot;, &#x27;the chieftain&#x27;) and for Stalin his adopted name, meaning &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, became synonymous with his role as the absolute leader. For Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco, the use of modest, non-traditional titles displayed their absolute power even stronger as they did not need any, not even a historic legitimacy either. However, in the case of Franco, the title &quot;Caudillo&quot; did have a longer history for political-military figures in both Latin America and Spain. Franco also used the phrase &quot;By the Grace of God&quot; on coinage or other material displaying him as &quot;Caudillo&quot;, whereas Hitler and Mussolini rarely used such language or imagery. 

==== Human rights abuses, war crimes and genocides ====
Over time, dictators have been known to use tactics that violate human rights. For example, under the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, government policy was enforced by secret police and the Gulag system of prison labour camps. Most Gulag inmates were not political prisoners, although significant numbers of political prisoners could be found in the camps at any one time. Data collected from Soviet archives gives the death toll from Gulags as 1,053,829. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudan&#x27;s military dictator Omar al-Bashir over alleged war crimes in Darfur. Also, while serious allegations have been made by some critics regarding human rights abuses during Bangladesh&#x27;s so-called fascist dictator Sheikh Hasina’s tenure, these claims remain disputed and have not been formally adjudicated as war crimes or genocide by international legal bodies. United Nations reviews, and scholarly research that critically assess the situation in Bangladesh.

Similar crimes were committed during Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s rule over the People&#x27;s Republic of China during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, where Mao set out to purge dissidents, primarily through the use of youth groups strongly committed to his cult of personality, and during Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s junta in Chile. Some dictators have been associated with genocide on certain races or groups; the most notable and wide-reaching example is the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s genocide of eleven million people, of whom six million were Jews. Later on in Democratic Kampuchea, General Secretary Pol Pot and his policies killed an estimated 1.7 million people (out of a population of 7 million) during his four-year dictatorship. As a result, Pol Pot is sometimes described as &quot;the Hitler of Cambodia&quot; and &quot;a genocidal tyrant&quot;.

=== Modern usage in formal titles ===
Because of its negative and pejorative connotations, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term &quot;dictator&quot; in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of president. In the 19th century, however, its official usage was more common:

* The Dictatorial Government of Sicily (27 May – 4 November 1860) was a provisional executive government appointed by Giuseppe Garibaldi to rule Sicily during the Expedition of the Thousand. The government ended when Sicily&#x27;s annexation into the Kingdom of Italy was ratified by plebiscite.
* Marian Langiewicz of Poland proclaimed himself Dictator and attempted (unsuccessfully) to form a Polish government in March 1863.
* Romuald Traugutt was Dictator of Poland from 17 October 1863 to 10 April 1864.
* The Dictatorial Government of the Philippines (24 May – 23 June 1898) was an insurgent government in the Philippines which was headed by Emilio Aguinaldo, who formally held the title of Dictator. The dictatorial government was superseded by the revolutionary government with Aguinaldo as president.

=== Criticism ===
The usage of the term &quot;dictator&quot; in western media has been criticized by the left-leaning organization Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting as &quot;Code for Government We Don&#x27;t Like&quot;. According to them, leaders that would generally be considered authoritarian but are allied with the United States such as Paul Biya or Nursultan Nazarbayev are rarely referred to as &quot;dictators&quot;, while leaders of countries opposed to U.S. policy such as Nicolás Maduro or Bashar al-Assad have the term applied to them much more liberally.

<doc id="8410" wikidata="Q5329" url="?curid=8410" title="Decibel">
<text>The decibel (symbol: dB) is a relative unit of measurement equal to one tenth of a bel (B). It expresses the ratio of two values of a power or root-power quantity on a logarithmic scale. Two signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10 (approximately ) or root-power ratio of 101/20 (approximately ).

The unit fundamentally expresses a relative change but may also be used to express an absolute value as the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, the unit symbol is often suffixed with letter codes that indicate the reference value. For example, for the reference value of 1 volt, a common suffix is &quot;V&quot; (e.g., &quot;20 dBV&quot;).

Two principal types of scaling of the decibel are in common use. When expressing a power ratio, it is defined as ten times the logarithm with base 10. That is, a change in &quot;power&quot; by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level. When expressing root-power quantities, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two, so that the related power and root-power levels change by the same value in linear systems, where power is proportional to the square of amplitude.

The definition of the decibel originated in the measurement of transmission loss and power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. The bel was named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, but the bel is seldom used. Instead, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most prominently for sound power in acoustics, in electronics and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.

== History ==
The decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. Until the mid-1920s, the unit for loss was &quot;miles of standard cable&quot; (MSC). 1 MSC corresponded to the loss of power over one mile (approximately 1.6 km) of standard telephone cable at a frequency of  radians per second (795.8 Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to a listener. A standard telephone cable was &quot;a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054 microfarads per mile&quot; (approximately corresponding to 19 gauge wire).

In 1924, Bell Telephone Laboratories received a favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony in Europe and replaced the MSC with the &quot;Transmission Unit&quot; (TU). 1 TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power.
The definition was conveniently chosen such that 1 TU approximated 1 MSC; specifically, 1 MSC was 1.056 TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU into the decibel, being one tenth of a newly defined unit for the base-10 logarithm of the power ratio. It was named the &quot;bel&quot;, in honor of the telecommunications pioneer Alexander Graham Bell.
The bel is seldom used, as the decibel was the proposed working unit.

The naming and early definition of the decibel is described in the NBS Standard&#x27;s Yearbook of 1931:

In 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name &quot;logit&quot; for &quot;standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication&quot;, to contrast with the name &quot;unit&quot; for &quot;standard magnitudes which combine by addition&quot;.

In April 2003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the International System of Units (SI), but decided against the proposal. However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The IEC permits the use of the decibel with root-power quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as NIST, which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios. In spite of their widespread use, suffixes (such as in dBA or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.

== Definition ==
The IEC Standard 60027-3:2002 defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: 1 dB = 0.1 B. The bel (B) is  ln(10) nepers: 1 B =  ln(10) Np. The neper is the change in the level of a root-power quantity when the root-power quantity changes by a factor of &quot;e&quot;, that is , thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural &quot;log&quot; of root-power-quantity ratios,  =  = . Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.

Therefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two root-power quantities of :1.

Two signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10, which is approximately , and an amplitude (root-power quantity) ratio of 101/20 ().

The bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with SI unit prefixes other than &quot;deci&quot;; it is customary, for example, to use &quot;hundredths of a decibel&quot; rather than &quot;millibels&quot;. Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written 0.05 dB, and not 5 mB.

The method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a &quot;power quantity&quot; or a &quot;root-power quantity&quot;; see &quot;Power, root-power, and field quantities&quot; for details.

=== Power quantities ===
When referring to measurements of &quot;power&quot; quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of &quot;P&quot; (measured power) to &quot;P&quot;0 (reference power) is represented by &quot;L&quot;&quot;P&quot;, that ratio expressed in decibels, which is calculated using the formula:
: formula_1

The base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel). &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;0 must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If &quot;P&quot;0 in the above equation, then &quot;L&quot;&quot;P&quot; = 0. If &quot;P&quot; is greater than &quot;P&quot;0 then &quot;L&quot;&quot;P&quot; is positive; if &quot;P&quot; is less than &quot;P&quot;0 then &quot;L&quot;&quot;P&quot; is negative.

Rearranging the above equation gives the following formula for &quot;P&quot; in terms of &quot;P&quot;0 and &quot;L&quot;&quot;P&quot; :
: formula_2

=== Root-power (field) quantities ===

When referring to measurements of root-power quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of &quot;F&quot; (measured) and &quot;F&quot;0 (reference). This is because the definitions were originally formulated to give the same value for relative ratios for both power and root-power quantities. Thus, the following definition is used:
: formula_3

The formula may be rearranged to give
: formula_4

Similarly, in electrical circuits, dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of voltage or current when the impedance is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level &quot;L&quot;&quot;G&quot;:
: formula_5
where &quot;V&quot;out is the root-mean-square (rms) output voltage, &quot;V&quot;in is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.

The term &quot;root-power quantity&quot; is introduced by ISO Standard 80000-1:2009 as a substitute of &quot;field quantity&quot;. The term &quot;field quantity&quot; is deprecated by that standard and &quot;root-power&quot; is used throughout this article.

=== Relationship between power and root-power levels ===
Although power and root-power quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels. A factor of 2 is introduced to make &quot;changes&quot; in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the &quot;same&quot; waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time. This relies on the relationship
:formula_6
holding. In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity. However, even in a linear system in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. voltage and current), if the impedance is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.

For differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot; need not be related), or equivalently,
: formula_7
must hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the root-power level difference from power &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot; to &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0 dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified. Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities power spectral density and the associated root-power quantities via the Fourier transform, which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.

=== Conversions ===
Since logarithm differences measured in these units often represent power ratios and root-power ratios, values for both are shown below. The bel is traditionally used as a unit of logarithmic power ratio, while the neper is used for logarithmic root-power (amplitude) ratio.

=== Examples ===
The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a reference point.
* Calculating the ratio in decibels of (one kilowatt, or watts) to yields: formula_8
* The ratio in decibels of to is: formula_9
, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that &quot;L&quot;&quot;G&quot; has the same value, 30 dB, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.
* The ratio in decibels of to (one milliwatt) is obtained with the formula: formula_10
* The power ratio corresponding to a change in level is given by: formula_11

A change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of . A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or is approximately a change of 3 dB. More precisely, the change is ± dB, but this is almost universally rounded to 3 dB in technical writing. This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of . Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, corresponding to a quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as 6 dB rather than ± dB.

Should it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional significant figures. 3.000 dB corresponds to a power ratio of 103/10, or , about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of , about 0.12% different from exactly . Similarly, an increase of 6.000 dB corresponds to a power ratio of , about 0.5% different from 4.

== Properties ==
The decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplicative effects, such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive, such as in the combined sound pressure level of two machines operating together. Care is also necessary with decibels directly in fractions and with the units of multiplicative operations.

=== Reporting large ratios ===
The logarithmic scale nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to scientific notation. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See &quot;Bode plot&quot; and &quot;Semi-log plot&quot;. For example, 120 dB SPL may be clearer than &quot;a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing&quot;.

=== Representation of multiplication operations ===
Level values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, = log(&quot;A&quot;) + log(&quot;B&quot;) + log(&quot;C&quot;). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1 dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3 dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10 dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:
*A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10 dB, 8 dB, and 7 dB respectively, for a total gain of 25 dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1 dB, this is: With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately Calculated precisely, the output is 1 W × 1025/10 ≈ 316.2 W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.

However, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of slide rules than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.
Quantities in decibels are not necessarily additive, thus being &quot;of unacceptable form for use in dimensional analysis&quot;.
Thus, units require special care in decibel operations. Take, for example, carrier-to-noise-density ratio &quot;C&quot;/&quot;N&quot;0 (in hertz), involving carrier power &quot;C&quot; (in watts) and noise power spectral density &quot;N&quot;0 (in W/Hz). Expressed in decibels, this ratio would be a subtraction (&quot;C&quot;/&quot;N&quot;0)dB = &quot;C&quot;dB − &quot;N&quot;0 dB. However, the linear-scale units still simplify in the implied fraction, so that the results would be expressed in dB-Hz.

=== Representation of addition operations ===

According to Mitschke, &quot;The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.&quot; However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:if two machines each individually produce a sound pressure level of, say, 90 dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93 dB, but certainly not to 180 dB!; suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87 dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83 dBA. [...] the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by &#x27;subtracting&#x27; the 83 dBA background noise from the combined level of 87 dBA; i.e., 84.8 dBA.; in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. [...] Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of [...] 70 dB and 90 dB: logarithmic average = 87 dB; arithmetic average = 80 dB.

Addition on a logarithmic scale is called logarithmic addition, and can be defined by taking exponentials to convert to a linear scale, adding there, and then taking logarithms to return. For example, where operations on decibels are logarithmic addition/subtraction and logarithmic multiplication/division, while operations on the linear scale are the usual operations:
:formula_12
:formula_13
The logarithmic mean is obtained from the logarithmic sum by subtracting formula_14, since logarithmic division is linear subtraction.

=== Fractions ===
Attenuation constants, in topics such as optical fiber communication and radio propagation path loss, are often expressed as a fraction or ratio to distance of transmission. In this case, represents decibel per meter, represents decibel per mile, for example. These quantities are to be manipulated obeying the rules of dimensional analysis, e.g., a 100-meter run with a fiber yields a loss of 0.1 km.

== Uses ==

=== Perception ===
The human perception of the intensity of sound and light more nearly approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship (see Weber–Fechner law), making the dB scale a useful measure.

=== Acoustics ===
The decibel is commonly used in acoustics as a unit of sound power level or sound pressure level. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure. As sound pressure is a root-power quantity, the appropriate version of the unit definition is used:
: formula_15
where &quot;p&quot;rms is the root mean square of the measured sound pressure and &quot;p&quot;ref is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals in air or 1 micropascal in water.

Use of the decibel in underwater acoustics leads to confusion, in part because of this difference in reference value.

Sound intensity is proportional to the square of sound pressure. Therefore, the sound intensity level can also be defined as:
: formula_16

The human ear has a large dynamic range in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is equal to or greater than 1 trillion (1012). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 1012 is 12, which is expressed as a sound intensity level of 120 dB re 1 pW/m2. The reference values of I and p in air have been chosen such that this corresponds approximately to a sound pressure level of 120 dB re 20 μPa.

Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, the acoustic power spectrum is modified by frequency weighting (A-weighting being the most common standard) to get the weighted acoustic power before converting to a sound level or noise level in decibels.

=== Telephony ===
The decibel is used in telephony and audio. Similarly to the use in acoustics, a frequency weighted power is often used. For audio noise measurements in electrical circuits, the weightings are called psophometric weightings.

=== Electronics ===
In electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for gains) in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a link budget.

The decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with &quot;m&quot; for &quot;milliwatt&quot; to produce the &quot;dBm&quot;. A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259 mW).

In professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the dBu. This is relative to the root mean square voltage which delivers 1 mW (0 dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or ≈ 0.775 VRMS. When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are identical.

=== Optics ===
In an optical link, if a known amount of optical power, in dBm (referenced to 1 mW), is launched into a fiber, and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.

In spectrometry and optics, the blocking unit used to measure optical density is equivalent to −1 B.

=== Video and digital imaging ===
In connection with video and digital image sensors, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a CCD imager where response voltage is linear in intensity.
Thus, a camera signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range quoted as 40 dB represents a ratio of 100:1 between optical signal intensity and optical-equivalent dark-noise intensity, not a 10,000:1 intensity (power) ratio as 40 dB might suggest.
Sometimes the 20 log ratio definition is applied to electron counts or photon counts directly, which are proportional to sensor signal amplitude without the need to consider whether the voltage response to intensity is linear.

However, as mentioned above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics, including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called &quot;dynamic range&quot; or &quot;signal-to-noise&quot; (of the camera) would be specified in , but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.

Photographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the stop, to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.

== Suffixes and reference values ==
Suffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.

In cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as &quot;absolute&quot;. If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.

This form of attaching suffixes to dB is widespread in practice, albeit being against the rules promulgated by standards bodies (ISO and IEC), given the &quot;unacceptability of attaching information to units&quot; and the &quot;unacceptability of mixing information with units&quot;. The IEC 60027-3 standard recommends the following format: or as , where &quot;x&quot; is the quantity symbol and &quot;x&quot;ref is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., &quot;L&quot;&quot;E&quot; (re 1 μV/m) = 20 dB or  = 20 dB for the electric field strength &quot;E&quot; relative to reference value.
If the measurement result 20 dB is presented separately, it can be specified using the information in parentheses, which is then part of the surrounding text and not a part of the unit: 20 dB (re ) or 20 dB .

Outside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (&quot;W&quot;,&quot;K&quot;,&quot;m&quot;), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (&quot;uV&quot; instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit&#x27;s name (&quot;sm&quot; for square meter, &quot;m&quot; for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (&quot;i&quot; for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, &quot;λ&quot; for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (&quot;A&quot; for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a hyphen, as in &quot;dBHz&quot;, or with a space, as in &quot;dB HL&quot;, or enclosed in parentheses, as in &quot;dB(HL)&quot;, or with no intervening character, as in &quot;dBm&quot; (which is non-compliant with international standards).

=== Voltage ===
Since the decibel is defined with respect to &quot;power&quot;, not &quot;amplitude&quot;, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.

; dB : dB(VRMS) – voltage relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance. This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer line-level of , in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a line-level signal.

; dB or dB : RMS voltage relative to (i.e. the voltage that would dissipate 1 mW into a 600 Ω load). An RMS voltage of 1 V therefore corresponds to formula_17 Originally dB, it was changed to dB to avoid confusion with dB. The &quot;v&quot; comes from &quot;volt&quot;, while &quot;u&quot; comes from the volume &quot;unit&quot; displayed on a VU meter.dB can be used as a measure of voltage, regardless of impedance, but is derived from a 600 Ω load dissipating 0 dB (1 mW). The reference voltage comes from the computation formula_18 where formula_19 is the resistance and formula_20 is the power.

: In professional audio, equipment may be calibrated to indicate a &quot;0&quot; on the VU meters some finite time after a signal has been applied at an amplitude of . Consumer equipment typically uses a lower &quot;nominal&quot; signal level of Therefore, many devices offer dual voltage operation (with different gain or &quot;trim&quot; settings) for interoperability reasons. A switch or adjustment that covers at least the range between and is common in professional equipment.

; dB : Defined by Recommendation ITU-R V.574 ; dB: dB(mVRMS) – root mean square voltage relative to 1 millivolt across 75 Ω. Widely used in cable television networks, where the nominal strength of a single TV signal at the receiver terminals is about 0 dB. Cable TV uses 75 Ω coaxial cable, so 0 dB corresponds to −78.75 dB or approximately 13 nW.

; dB or dB : dB(μVRMS) – voltage relative to 1 microvolt. Widely used in television and aerial amplifier specifications. 60 dBμV = 0 dB.

=== Acoustics ===
Probably the most common usage of &quot;decibels&quot; in reference to sound level is dB, sound pressure level referenced to the nominal threshold of human hearing: The measures of pressure (a root-power quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dB and dB) use the factor of 10.
; dB : dB (sound pressure level) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 micropascals (μPa), or , a level of 0 dB is approximately the quietest sound a human can hear. For sound in water and other liquids, a reference pressure of 1 μPa is used. An RMS sound pressure of one pascal corresponds to a level of 94 dB SPL.
; dB : dB sound intensity level – relative to 10−12 W/m2, which is roughly the threshold of human hearing in air.
; dB : dB sound power level – relative to 10−12 W.
; dB, dB, and dB : These symbols are often used to denote the use of different weighting filters, used to approximate the human ear&#x27;s response to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB or dB(A). According to standards from the International Electro-technical Committee (IEC 61672-2013) and the American National Standards Institute, ANSI S1.4, the preferred usage is to write Nevertheless, the units dB and dB(A) are still commonly used as a shorthand for Aweighted measurements. Compare dB, used in telecommunications.
; dB : dB hearing level is used in audiograms as a measure of hearing loss. The reference level varies with frequency according to a minimum audibility curve as defined in ANSI and other standards, such that the resulting audiogram shows deviation from what is regarded as &#x27;normal&#x27; hearing.

Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale sinusoid or alternatively a full-scale square wave.

; dB : dB volume unit
; dB : dB(true peak) – peak amplitude of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. In digital systems, 0 dB would equal the highest level (number) the processor is capable of representing. Measured values are always negative or zero, since they are less than or equal to full-scale.

; dB or dB: dB(overload) – the amplitude of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. Similar to dB FS, but also applicable to analog systems. According to ITU-T Rec. G.100.1 the level in dB ov of a digital system is defined as: formula_21 with the maximum signal power formula_22 for a rectangular signal with the maximum amplitude formula_23 The level of a tone with a digital amplitude (peak value) of formula_24 is therefore formula_25

<doc id="8411" wikidata="Q183493" url="?curid=8411" title="Darwinism">
<text>Darwinism is a term used to describe a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and others. The theory states that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual&#x27;s ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin&#x27;s theories. English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; in April 1860.

==Terminology==
Darwinism subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the Weismann barrier, or the central dogma of molecular biology. Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life or to cosmic evolution, that are distinct to biological evolution, and therefore consider it to be the belief and acceptance of Darwin&#x27;s and of his predecessors&#x27; work, in place of other concepts, including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.

English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; in April 1860. It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher Herbert Spencer. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of German evolutionary biologist August Weismann gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism&quot;, scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern synthesis in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in an updated form.

While the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as Olivia Judson, Eugenie Scott, and Carl Safina that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory. For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of heredity. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift, for example.

In the United States and to some extent in the United Kingdom, creationists often use the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; as a pejorative term in reference to beliefs such as scientific materialism.

==Huxley==
Huxley, upon first reading Darwin&#x27;s theory in 1858, responded, &quot;How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!&quot;

While the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;. Having hailed the book as &quot;a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism&quot; promoting scientific naturalism over theology, and praising the usefulness of Darwin&#x27;s ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin&#x27;s gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species, Huxley compared Darwin&#x27;s achievement to that of Nicolaus Copernicus in explaining planetary motion:
These are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:

# More individuals are produced each generation than can survive.
# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.
# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.
# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.

==Other 19th-century usage==
&quot;Darwinism&quot; soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer&#x27;s own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck than to that of Darwin, and predated the publication of Darwin&#x27;s theory in 1859. What is now called &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; was, in its day, synonymous with &quot;Darwinism&quot;—the application of Darwinian principles of &quot;struggle&quot; to society, usually in support of anti-philanthropic political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin&#x27;s half-cousin Francis Galton, was that &quot;Darwinism&quot; implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on &quot;civilized&quot; people, it was possible for &quot;inferior&quot; strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the &quot;superior&quot; strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable—the foundation of eugenics.
In Darwin&#x27;s day there was no rigid definition of the term &quot;Darwinism&quot;, and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin&#x27;s biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and Ernst Haeckel developed what was known as &quot;Darwinismus&quot; in Germany, although, like Spencer&#x27;s &quot;evolution&quot;, Haeckel&#x27;s &quot;Darwinism&quot; had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centred on natural selection. In 1886, Alfred Russel Wallace went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called &quot;Darwinism&quot; without any problems.

In his book &quot;Darwinism&quot; (1889), Wallace had used the term &quot;pure-Darwinism&quot; which proposed a &quot;greater efficacy&quot; for natural selection. George Romanes dubbed this view as &quot;Wallaceism&quot;, noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a &quot;pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory.&quot; Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist. Romanes&#x27; definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin&#x27;s views and was contrasted with Wallace&#x27;s definition of the term.

==Contemporary usage==
The term &quot;Darwinism&quot; is often used in the United States by promoters of creationism, notably by leading members of the intelligent design movement, as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an &quot;ism&quot;) based on philosophical naturalism, atheism, or both. For example, in 1993, UC Berkeley law professor and author Phillip E. Johnson made this accusation of atheism with reference to Charles Hodge&#x27;s 1874 book &quot;What Is Darwinism?&quot; However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist Asa Gray who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin&#x27;s natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book&#x27;s title by concluding: &quot;It is Atheism.&quot;

Creationists use pejoratively the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as dogmatic and inflexible in their belief. In the 2008 documentary film &quot;&quot;, which promotes intelligent design (ID), American writer and actor Ben Stein refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, John Rennie says &quot;The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin&#x27;s original ideas ... Yet the choice of terminology isn&#x27;t random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to Marxism.&quot;

However, &quot;Darwinism&quot; is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is sometimes called &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot;, from those first proposed by Darwin. &quot;Darwinism&quot; also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, &quot;Darwinism&quot; may refer to Darwin&#x27;s proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the history of evolutionary thought—particularly contrasting Darwin&#x27;s results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.

In political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. Biologist E. O. Wilson at Harvard University described the term as being &quot;a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like &#x27;Maoism [...] Scientists don&#x27;t call it &#x27;Darwinism&#x27;.&quot; In the United Kingdom, the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote in his collection of essays &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot;, published in 2003, that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.

In his 1995 book &quot;Darwinian Fairytales&quot;, Australian philosopher David Stove used the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; in a different sense from the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some &quot;Ultra-Darwinists&quot;. Stove alleged that by using weak or false &quot;ad hoc&quot; reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid: for example, Stove suggested that the sociobiological explanation of altruism as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism. English philosopher Simon Blackburn wrote a rejoinder to Stove, though a subsequent essay by Stove&#x27;s protégé James Franklin suggested that Blackburn&#x27;s response actually &quot;confirms Stove&#x27;s central thesis that Darwinism can &#x27;explain&#x27; anything.&quot;

In more recent times, the Australian moral philosopher and professor Peter Singer, who serves as the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, has proposed the development of a &quot;Darwinian left&quot; based on the contemporary scientific understanding of biological anthropology, human evolution, and applied ethics in order to achieve the establishment of a more equal and cooperative human society in accordance with the sociobiological explanation of altruism.

==Esoteric usage==
In evolutionary aesthetics theory, there is evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by natural selection and therefore Darwinian; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human&#x27;s genes.
