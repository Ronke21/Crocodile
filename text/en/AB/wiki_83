<text>The Eocene ( ) is a geological epoch that lasted from about 56 to 33.9 million years ago (Ma). It is the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. The name &quot;Eocene&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;Ēṓs&quot;, &quot;Dawn&quot;) and (&quot;kainós&quot;, &quot;new&quot;) and refers to the &quot;dawn&quot; of modern (&#x27;new&#x27;) fauna that appeared during the epoch.

The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope 13C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope 12C. The average temperature of Earth at the beginning of the Eocene was about 27 degrees Celsius. The end is set at a major extinction event called the &quot;Grande Coupure&quot; (the &quot;Great Break&quot; in continuity) or the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Eocene&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek (&quot;Ēṓs&quot;) meaning &quot;Dawn&quot;, and &quot;kainos&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot; or &quot;recent&quot;, as the epoch saw the dawn of recent, or modern, life.

Scottish geologist Charles Lyell (ignoring the Quaternary) divided the Tertiary Epoch into the Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene, and New Pliocene (Holocene) Periods in 1833. British geologist John Phillips proposed the Cenozoic in 1840 in place of the Tertiary, and Austrian paleontologist Moritz Hörnes introduced the Paleogene for the Eocene and Neogene for the Miocene and Pliocene in 1853. After decades of inconsistent usage, the newly formed International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), in 1969, standardized stratigraphy based on the prevailing opinions in Europe: the Cenozoic Era subdivided into the Tertiary and Quaternary sub-eras, and the Tertiary subdivided into the Paleogene and Neogene periods. In 1978, the Paleogene was officially defined as the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs; and the Neogene as the Miocene and Pliocene epochs. In 1989, Tertiary and Quaternary were removed from the time scale due to the arbitrary nature of their boundary, but Quaternary was reinstated in 2009.

===Boundaries===
The Eocene is a dynamic epoch that represents global climatic transitions between two climatic extremes, transitioning from the hot house to the cold house. The beginning of the Eocene is marked by the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, a short period of intense warming and ocean acidification brought about by the release of carbon en masse into the atmosphere and ocean systems, which led to a mass extinction of 30–50% of benthic foraminifera (single-celled species which are used as bioindicators of the health of a marine ecosystem)—one of the largest in the Cenozoic. This event happened around 55.8 Ma, and was one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic.

The middle Eocene was characterized by the shift towards a cooler climate at the end of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, around 47.8 Ma, which was briefly interrupted by another warming event, the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. Lasting for about 400,000 years, the MECO was responsible for a globally uniform 4° to 6°C warming of both the surface and deep oceans, as inferred from foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope records. The resumption of a long-term gradual cooling trend resulted in a glacial maximum at the late Eocene/early Oligocene boundary. 

The end of the Eocene was also marked by the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, also known as the &quot;Grande Coupure&quot;.

===Stratigraphy===

The Eocene is conventionally divided into early (56–47.8 Ma), middle (47.8–38 Ma), and late (38–33.9 Ma) subdivisions. The corresponding rocks are referred to as lower, middle, and upper Eocene. The Ypresian Stage constitutes the lower, the Priabonian Stage the upper; and the Lutetian and Bartonian stages are united as the middle Eocene.

The Western North American floras of the Eocene were divided into four floral &quot;stages&quot; by Jack Wolfe (1968) based on work with the Puget Group fossils of King County, Washington. The four stages, Franklinian, Fultonian, Ravenian, and Kummerian covered the Early Eocene through early Oligocene, and three of the four were given informal early/late substages. Wolfe tentatively deemed the Franklinian as Early Eocene, the Fultonian as Middle Eocene, the Ravenian as Late, and the Kummerian as Early Oligocene. The beginning of the Kummerian was refined by Gregory Retallack &quot;et al&quot; (2004) as 40 Mya, with a refined end at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary where the younger Angoonian floral stage starts.

== Palaeogeography and tectonics ==

During the Eocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents may have mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the planet and keeping global temperatures high. When Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were routed away from Antarctica. An isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. However, modeling results call into question the thermal isolation model for late Eocene cooling, and decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may have been more important. Once the Antarctic region began to cool down, the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and icefloes north and reinforcing the cooling.

The northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to fragment, as Europe, Greenland and North America drifted apart.

In western North America, the Laramide Orogeny came to an end in the Eocene, and compression was replaced with crustal extension that ultimately gave rise to the Basin and Range Province. The Kishenehn Basin, around 1.5 km in elevation during the Lutetian, was uplifted to an altitude of 2.5 km by the Priabonian. Huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts, resulting in the deposition of the Green River Formation lagerstätte.

At about 35 Ma, an asteroid impact on the eastern coast of North America formed the Chesapeake Bay impact crater.

The Tethys Ocean finally closed with the collision of Africa and Eurasia, while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant, the Mediterranean, and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north. Planktonic foraminifera in the northwestern Peri-Tethys are very similar to those of the Tethys in the middle Lutetian but become completely disparate in the Bartonian, indicating biogeographic separation. Though the North Atlantic was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar.

Eurasia was separated in three different landmasses 50 Ma; Western Europe, Balkanatolia and Asia. About 40 Ma, Balkanatolia and Asia were connected, while Europe was connected 34 Ma. The Fushun Basin contained large, suboxic lakes known as the paleo-Jijuntun Lakes.

India collided with Asia, folding to initiate formation of the Himalayas. The incipient subcontinent collided with the Kohistan–Ladakh Arc around 50.2 Ma and with Karakoram around 40.4 Ma, with the final collision between Asia and India occurring ~40 Ma.

== Climate ==

The Eocene Epoch contained a wide variety of climate conditions that includes the warmest climate in the Cenozoic Era, and arguably the warmest time interval since the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and Early Triassic, and ends in an icehouse climate. The evolution of the Eocene climate began with warming after the end of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at 56 Ma to a maximum during the Eocene Optimum at around 49 Ma. During this period of time, little to no ice was present on Earth with a smaller difference in temperature from the equator to the poles. Because of this the maximum sea level was 150 meters higher than current levels. Following the maximum was a descent into an icehouse climate from the Eocene Optimum to the Eocene–Oligocene transition at 34 Ma. During this decrease, ice began to reappear at the poles, and the Eocene–Oligocene transition is the period of time when the Antarctic ice sheet began to rapidly expand.

=== Early Eocene ===

Greenhouse gases, in particular carbon dioxide and methane, played a significant role during the Eocene in controlling the surface temperature. The end of the PETM was met with very large sequestration of carbon dioxide into the forms of methane clathrate, coal, and crude oil at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, that reduced the atmospheric carbon dioxide. This event was similar in magnitude to the massive release of greenhouse gasses at the beginning of the PETM, and it is hypothesized that the sequestration was mainly due to organic carbon burial and weathering of silicates. For the early Eocene there is much discussion on how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere. This is due to numerous proxies representing different atmospheric carbon dioxide content. For example, diverse geochemical and paleontological proxies indicate that at the maximum of global warmth the atmospheric carbon dioxide values were at 700–900 ppm, while model simulations suggest a concentration of 1,680 ppm fits best with deep sea, sea surface, and near-surface air temperatures of the time. Other proxies such as pedogenic (soil building) carbonate and marine boron isotopes indicate large changes of carbon dioxide of over 2,000 ppm over periods of time of less than 1 million years. This large influx of carbon dioxide could be attributed to volcanic out-gassing due to North Atlantic rifting or oxidation of methane stored in large reservoirs deposited from the PETM event in the sea floor or wetland environments. For contrast, today the carbon dioxide levels are at 400 ppm or 0.04%. 

During the early Eocene, methane was another greenhouse gas that had a drastic effect on the climate. Methane has 30 times more of a warming effect than carbon dioxide on a 100-year scale (i.e., methane has a global warming potential of 29.8±11). Most of the methane released to the atmosphere during this period of time would have been from wetlands, swamps, and forests. The atmospheric methane concentration today is 0.000179% or 1.79 ppmv. As a result of the warmer climate and the sea level rise associated with the early Eocene, more wetlands, more forests, and more coal deposits would have been available for methane release. If we compare the early Eocene production of methane to current levels of atmospheric methane, the early Eocene would have produced triple the amount of methane. The warm temperatures during the early Eocene could have increased methane production rates, and methane that is released into the atmosphere would in turn warm the troposphere, cool the stratosphere, and produce water vapor and carbon dioxide through oxidation. Biogenic production of methane produces carbon dioxide and water vapor along with the methane, as well as yielding infrared radiation. The breakdown of methane in an atmosphere containing oxygen produces carbon monoxide, water vapor and infrared radiation. The carbon monoxide is not stable, so it eventually becomes carbon dioxide and in doing so releases yet more infrared radiation. Water vapor traps more infrared than does carbon dioxide. At about the beginning of the Eocene Epoch (55.8–33.9 Ma) the amount of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere more or less doubled.

During the warming in the early Eocene between 55 and 52 Ma, there were a series of short-term changes of carbon isotope composition in the ocean. These isotope changes occurred due to the release of carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere that led to a temperature increase of at the surface of the ocean. Recent analysis of and research into these hyperthermals in the early Eocene has led to hypotheses that the hyperthermals are based on orbital parameters, in particular eccentricity and obliquity. The hyperthermals in the early Eocene, notably the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2), and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 3 (ETM3), were analyzed and found that orbital control may have had a role in triggering the ETM2 and ETM3. An enhancement of the biological pump proved effective at sequestering excess carbon during the recovery phases of these hyperthermals. These hyperthermals led to increased perturbations in planktonic and benthic foraminifera, with a higher rate of fluvial sedimentation as a consequence of the warmer temperatures. Unlike the PETM, the lesser hyperthermals of the Early Eocene had negligible consequences for terrestrial mammals. These Early Eocene hyperthermals produced a sustained period of extremely hot climate known as the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). During the early and middle EECO, the superabundance of the euryhaline dinocyst &quot;Homotryblium&quot; in New Zealand indicates elevated ocean salinity in the region.

==== Equable climate problem ====

One of the unique features of the Eocene&#x27;s climate as mentioned before was the equable and homogeneous climate that existed in the early parts of the Eocene. A multitude of proxies support the presence of a warmer equable climate being present during this period of time. A few of these proxies include the presence of fossils native to warm climates, such as crocodiles, located in the higher latitudes, the presence in the high latitudes of frost-intolerant flora such as palm trees which cannot survive during sustained freezes, and fossils of snakes found in the tropics that would require much higher average temperatures to sustain them. TEX86 BAYSPAR measurements indicate extremely high sea surface temperatures of to at low latitudes, although clumped isotope analyses point to a maximum low latitude sea surface temperature of ± during the EECO. Relative to present-day values, bottom water temperatures are higher according to isotope proxies. With these bottom water temperatures, temperatures in areas where deep water forms near the poles are unable to be much cooler than the bottom water temperatures.

An issue arises, however, when trying to model the Eocene and reproduce the results that are found with the proxy data. Using all different ranges of greenhouse gasses that occurred during the early Eocene, models were unable to produce the warming that was found at the poles and the reduced seasonality that occurs with winters at the poles being substantially warmer. The models, while accurately predicting the tropics, tend to produce significantly cooler temperatures of up to colder than the actual determined temperature at the poles. This error has been classified as the &quot;equable climate problem&quot;. To solve this problem, the solution would involve finding a process to warm the poles without warming the tropics. Some hypotheses and tests which attempt to find the process are listed below.

===== Large lakes =====

Due to the nature of water as opposed to land, less temperature variability would be present if a large body of water is also present. In an attempt to try to mitigate the cooling polar temperatures, large lakes were proposed to mitigate seasonal climate changes. To replicate this case, a lake was inserted into North America and a climate model was run using varying carbon dioxide levels. The model runs concluded that while the lake did reduce the seasonality of the region greater than just an increase in carbon dioxide, the addition of a large lake was unable to reduce the seasonality to the levels shown by the floral and faunal data.

===== Ocean heat transport =====

The transport of heat from the tropics to the poles, much like how ocean heat transport functions in modern times, was considered a possibility for the increased temperature and reduced seasonality for the poles. With the increased sea surface temperatures and the increased temperature of the deep ocean water during the early Eocene, one common hypothesis was that due to these increases there would be a greater transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Simulating these differences, the models produced lower heat transport due to the lower temperature gradients and were unsuccessful in producing an equable climate from only ocean heat transport.

===== Orbital parameters =====

While typically seen as a control on ice growth and seasonality, the orbital parameters were theorized as a possible control on continental temperatures and seasonality. Simulating the Eocene by using an ice free planet, eccentricity, obliquity, and precession were modified in different model runs to determine all the possible different scenarios that could occur and their effects on temperature. One particular case led to warmer winters and cooler summer by up to 30% in the North American continent, and it reduced the seasonal variation of temperature by up to 75%. While orbital parameters did not produce the warming at the poles, the parameters did show a great effect on seasonality and needed to be considered.

===== Polar stratospheric clouds =====

Another method considered for producing the warm polar temperatures were polar stratospheric clouds. Polar stratospheric clouds are clouds that occur in the lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. Polar stratospheric clouds have a great impact on radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their optical thickness, polar stratospheric clouds act similar to a greenhouse gas and trap outgoing longwave radiation. Different types of polar stratospheric clouds occur in the atmosphere: polar stratospheric clouds that are created due to interactions with nitric or sulfuric acid and water (Type I) or polar stratospheric clouds that are created with only water ice (Type II).

Methane is an important factor in the creation of the primary Type II polar stratospheric clouds that were created in the early Eocene. Since water vapor is the only supporting substance used in Type II polar stratospheric clouds, the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is necessary where in most situations the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is rare. When methane is oxidized, a significant amount of water vapor is released. Another requirement for polar stratospheric clouds is cold temperatures to ensure condensation and cloud production. Polar stratospheric cloud production, since it requires the cold temperatures, is usually limited to nighttime and winter conditions. With this combination of wetter and colder conditions in the lower stratosphere, polar stratospheric clouds could have formed over wide areas in Polar Regions.

To test the polar stratospheric clouds effects on the Eocene climate, models were run comparing the effects of polar stratospheric clouds at the poles to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The polar stratospheric clouds had a warming effect on the poles, increasing temperatures by up to 20 °C in the winter months. A multitude of feedbacks also occurred in the models due to the polar stratospheric clouds&#x27; presence. Any ice growth was slowed immensely and would lead to any present ice melting. Only the poles were affected with the change in temperature and the tropics were unaffected, which with an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would also cause the tropics to increase in temperature. Due to the warming of the troposphere from the increased greenhouse effect of the polar stratospheric clouds, the stratosphere would cool and would potentially increase the amount of polar stratospheric clouds.

While the polar stratospheric clouds could explain the reduction of the equator to pole temperature gradient and the increased temperatures at the poles during the early Eocene, there are a few drawbacks to maintaining polar stratospheric clouds for an extended period of time. Separate model runs were used to determine the sustainability of the polar stratospheric clouds. It was determined that in order to maintain the lower stratospheric water vapor, methane would need to be continually released and sustained. In addition, the amounts of ice and condensation nuclei would need to be high in order for the polar stratospheric cloud to sustain itself and eventually expand.

=== Middle Eocene ===

The Eocene is not only known for containing the warmest period during the Cenozoic; it also marked the decline into an icehouse climate and the rapid expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. The transition from a warming climate into a cooling climate began at around 49 Ma. Isotopes of carbon and oxygen indicate a shift to a global cooling climate. The cause of the cooling has been attributed to a significant decrease of &gt;2,000 ppm in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. One proposed cause of the reduction in carbon dioxide during the warming to cooling transition was the azolla event. With the equable climate during the early Eocene, warm temperatures in the arctic allowed for the growth of azolla, which is a floating aquatic fern, on the Arctic Ocean. The significantly high amounts of carbon dioxide also acted to facilitate azolla blooms across the Arctic Ocean. Compared to current carbon dioxide levels, these azolla grew rapidly in the enhanced carbon dioxide levels found in the early Eocene. The isolation of the Arctic Ocean, evidenced by euxinia that occurred at this time, led to stagnant waters and as the azolla sank to the sea floor, they became part of the sediments on the seabed and effectively sequestered the carbon by locking it out of the atmosphere for good. The ability for the azolla to sequester carbon is exceptional, and the enhanced burial of azolla could have had a significant effect on the world atmospheric carbon content and may have been the event to begin the transition into an ice house climate. The azolla event could have led to a draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide of up to 470 ppm. Assuming the carbon dioxide concentrations were at 900 ppmv prior to the Azolla Event they would have dropped to 430 ppmv, or 30 ppmv more than they are today, after the Azolla Event. This cooling trend at the end of the EECO has also been proposed to have been caused by increased siliceous plankton productivity and marine carbon burial, which also helped draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Cooling after this event, part of a trend known as the Middle-Late Eocene Cooling (MLEC), continued due to continual decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide from organic productivity and weathering from mountain building. Many regions of the world became more arid and cold over the course of the stage, such as the Fushun Basin. In East Asia, lake level changes were in sync with global sea level changes over the course of the MLEC.

Global cooling continued until there was a major reversal from cooling to warming in the Bartonian. This warming event, signifying a sudden and temporary reversal of the cooling conditions, is known as the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO). At around 41.5 Ma, stable isotopic analysis of samples from Southern Ocean drilling sites indicated a warming event for 600,000 years. A similar shift in carbon isotopes is known from the Northern Hemisphere in the Scaglia Limestones of Italy. Oxygen isotope analysis showed a large negative change in the proportion of heavier oxygen isotopes to lighter oxygen isotopes, which indicates an increase in global temperatures. The warming is considered to be primarily due to carbon dioxide increases, because carbon isotope signatures rule out major methane release during this short-term warming. A sharp increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was observed with a maximum of 4,000 ppm: the highest amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide detected during the Eocene. Other studies suggest a more modest rise in carbon dioxide levels. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has also been hypothesised to have been driven by increased seafloor spreading rates and metamorphic decarbonation reactions between Australia and Antarctica and increased amounts of volcanism in the region. One possible cause of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase could have been a sudden increase due to metamorphic release due to continental drift and collision of India with Asia and the resulting formation of the Himalayas; however, data on the exact timing of metamorphic release of atmospheric carbon dioxide is not well resolved in the data. Recent studies have mentioned, however, that the removal of the ocean between Asia and India could have released significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Another hypothesis still implicates a diminished negative feedback of silicate weathering as a result of continental rocks having become less weatherable during the warm Early and Middle Eocene, allowing volcanically released carbon dioxide to persist in the atmosphere for longer. Yet another explanation hypothesises that MECO warming was caused by the simultaneous occurrence of minima in both the 400 kyr and 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycles. During the MECO, sea surface temperatures in the Tethys Ocean jumped to 32–36 °C, and Tethyan seawater became more dysoxic. A decline in carbonate accumulation at ocean depths of greater than three kilometres took place synchronously with the peak of the MECO, signifying ocean acidification took place in the deep ocean. On top of that, MECO warming caused an increase in the respiration rates of pelagic heterotrophs, leading to a decreased proportion of primary productivity making its way down to the seafloor and causing a corresponding decline in populations of benthic foraminifera. An abrupt decrease in lakewater salinity in western North America occurred during this warming interval. This warming is short lived, as benthic oxygen isotope records indicate a return to cooling at ~40 Ma.

=== Late Eocene ===

At the end of the MECO, the MLEC resumed. Cooling and the carbon dioxide drawdown continued through the late Eocene and into the Eocene–Oligocene transition around 34 Ma. The post-MECO cooling brought with it a major aridification trend in Asia, enhanced by retreating seas. A monsoonal climate remained predominant in East Asia. The cooling during the initial stages of the opening of the Drake Passage ~38.5 Ma was not global, as evidenced by an absence of cooling in the North Atlantic. During the cooling period, benthic oxygen isotopes show the possibility of ice creation and ice increase during this later cooling. The end of the Eocene and beginning of the Oligocene is marked with the massive expansion of area of the Antarctic ice sheet that was a major step into the icehouse climate. Multiple proxies, such as oxygen isotopes and alkenones, indicate that at the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration had decreased to around 750–800 ppm, approximately twice that of present levels. Along with the decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide reducing the global temperature, orbital factors in ice creation can be seen with 100,000-year and 400,000-year fluctuations in benthic oxygen isotope records. Another major contribution to the expansion of the ice sheet was the creation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The creation of the Antarctic circumpolar current would isolate the cold water around the Antarctic, which would reduce heat transport to the Antarctic along with creating ocean gyres that result in the upwelling of colder bottom waters. The issue with this hypothesis of the consideration of this being a factor for the Eocene-Oligocene transition is the timing of the creation of the circulation is uncertain. For Drake Passage, sediments indicate the opening occurred ~41 Ma while tectonics indicate that this occurred ~32 Ma. Solar activity did not change significantly during the greenhouse-icehouse transition across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary.

==Flora==

During the early-middle Eocene, forests covered most of the Earth including the poles. Tropical forests extended across much of modern Africa, South America, Central America, India, South-east Asia and China.  Paratropical forests grew over North America, Europe and Russia, with broad-leafed evergreen and broad-leafed deciduous forests at higher latitudes.

Polar forests were quite extensive. Fossils and even preserved remains of trees such as swamp cypress and dawn redwood from the Eocene have been found on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic. Even at that time, Ellesmere Island was only a few degrees in latitude further south than it is today. Fossils of subtropical and even tropical trees and plants from the Eocene also have been found in Greenland and Alaska. Tropical rainforests grew as far north as northern North America and Europe.

Palm trees were growing as far north as Alaska and northern Europe during the early Eocene, although they became less abundant as the climate cooled. Dawn redwoods were far more extensive as well.

The earliest definitive &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; fossils were dated from 51.9 Ma, and were found in the Laguna del Hunco deposit in Chubut province in Argentina.

Cooling began mid-period, and by the end of the Eocene continental interiors had begun to dry, with forests thinning considerably in some areas. The newly evolved grasses began to expand during the climatic cooling and drying following the extreme warmth of the EECO, with subhumid savannas being known from South America since the Middle Eocene.

The cooling also brought seasonal changes. Deciduous trees, better able to cope with large temperature changes, began to overtake evergreen tropical species. By the end of the period, deciduous forests covered large parts of the northern continents, including North America, Eurasia and the Arctic, and rainforests held on only in equatorial South America, Africa, India and Australia.

Antarctica began the Eocene fringed with a warm temperate to sub-tropical rainforest. Pollen found in Prydz Bay from the Eocene suggest taiga forest existed there. It became much colder as the period progressed; the heat-loving tropical flora was wiped out, and by the beginning of the Oligocene, the continent hosted deciduous forests and vast stretches of tundra.

== Fauna ==

During the Eocene, plants and marine faunas became quite modern. Many modern bird orders first appeared in the Eocene. The Eocene oceans were warm and teeming with fish and other sea life.

=== Vertebrates ===
==== Mammals ====

The oldest known fossils of most of the modern mammal orders appear within a brief period during the early Eocene. At the beginning of the Eocene, several new mammal groups arrived in North America. These modern mammals, like artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and primates, had features like long, thin legs, feet, and hands capable of grasping, as well as differentiated teeth adapted for chewing. Dwarf forms reigned. All the members of the new mammal orders were small, under 10 kg; based on comparisons of tooth size, Eocene mammals were only 60% of the size of the primitive Palaeocene mammals that preceded them. They were also smaller than the mammals that followed them. It is assumed that the hot Eocene temperatures favored smaller animals that were better able to manage the heat.

Rodents were widespread. East Asian rodent faunas declined in diversity when they shifted from ctenodactyloid-dominant to cricetid–dipodid-dominant after the MECO.

Both groups of modern ungulates (hoofed animals) became prevalent because of a major radiation between Europe and North America, along with carnivorous ungulates like &quot;Mesonyx&quot;. Early forms of many other modern mammalian orders appeared, including horses (most notably the &quot;Eohippus&quot;), bats, proboscidians (elephants), primates, and rodents. Older primitive forms of mammals declined in variety and importance. Important Eocene land fauna fossil remains have been found in western North America, Europe, Patagonia, Egypt, and southeast Asia. Marine fauna are best known from South Asia and the southeast United States.

After the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, members of the Equoidea arose in North America and Europe, giving rise to some of the earliest equids such as &quot;Sifrhippus&quot; and basal European equoids such as the palaeothere &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;. Some of the later equoids were especially species-rich; &quot;Palaeotherium&quot;, ranging from small to very large in size, is known from as many as 16 species.

Established large-sized mammals of the Eocene include the &quot;Uintatherium&quot;, &quot;Arsinoitherium&quot;, and brontotheres, in which the former two, unlike the latter, did not belong to ungulates but groups that became extinct shortly after their establishments.

Large terrestrial mammalian predators had already existed since the Paleocene, but new forms now arose like &quot;Hyaenodon&quot; and &quot;Daphoenus&quot; (the earliest lineage of a once-successful predatory family known as bear dogs). Entelodonts meanwhile established themselves as some of the largest omnivores. The first nimravids, including Dinictis, established themselves as amongst the first feliforms to appear. Their groups became highly successful and continued to live past the Eocene.

&quot;Basilosaurus&quot; is a well-known Eocene whale, but whales as a group had become very diverse during the Eocene, which is when the major transitions from being terrestrial to fully aquatic in cetaceans occurred. The first sirenians were evolving at this time, and would eventually evolve into the extant manatees and dugongs.

==== Birds ====

Eocene birds include some enigmatic groups with resemblances to modern forms, some of which continued from the Paleocene. Bird taxa of the Eocene include carnivorous psittaciforms, such as Messelasturidae, Halcyornithidae, large flightless forms such as &quot;Gastornis&quot; and &quot;Eleutherornis&quot;, long legged falcon &quot;Masillaraptor&quot;, ancient galliforms such as Gallinuloides, putative rail relatives of the family Songziidae, various pseudotooth birds such as &quot;Gigantornis&quot;, the ibis relative &quot;Rhynchaeites&quot;, primitive swifts of the genus &quot;Aegialornis&quot;, and primitive penguins such as &quot;Archaeospheniscus&quot; and &quot;Inkayacu&quot;.

Many Eocene birds in Central Europe evolved tuberculate vertebrae as an adaptation against predation, with flightless birds facing low predation pressure during this time as a result.

==== Fishes ====

Fishes, both Chondrichthyes such as sharks and rays, and Osteichthyes (bony fishes), are abundant in the London Clay.

==== Reptiles ====

Reptile fossils from this time, such as fossils of pythons and turtles, are abundant.

=== Molluscs ===

=== Arthropods ===

Several rich fossil insect faunas are known from the Eocene, notably the Baltic amber found mainly along the south coast of the Baltic Sea, amber from the Paris Basin, France, the Fur Formation, Denmark, and the Bembridge Marls from the Isle of Wight, England. Insects found in Eocene deposits mostly belong to genera that exist today, though their range has often shifted since the Eocene. For instance the bibionid genus &quot;Plecia&quot; is common in fossil faunas from presently temperate areas, but only lives in the tropics and subtropics today. Platypleurin cicadas diversified during the Eocene. Ostracods flourished in the oceans.

<doc id="9420" wikidata="Q9832" url="?curid=9420" title="Eindhoven">
<text>Eindhoven ( ; ) is a city and municipality of the Netherlands, located in the southern province of North Brabant, of which it is the largest municipality, and is also located in the Dutch part of the natural region the Campine. With a population of 246,443 (1 January 2024) on a territory of 88.92 km2, it is the fifth-largest city of the Netherlands and the largest outside the Randstad conurbation.

Eindhoven was originally located at the confluence of the Dommel and the Gender. A municipality since the 13th century, Eindhoven witnessed rapid growth starting in the 1900s by textile and tobacco industries. Two well-known companies, DAF Trucks and Philips, were founded in the city; Philips would go on to become a major multinational conglomerate while based in Eindhoven. Apart from Philips, Eindhoven also contains the globally famous Design Academy Eindhoven.

Neighbouring cities and towns include Son en Breugel, Nuenen, Geldrop-Mierlo, Helmond, Heeze-Leende, Waalre, Veldhoven, Eersel, Oirschot and Best. The agglomeration has a population of . The metropolitan area consists of inhabitants. The city region has a population of 753,426. The Brabantse Stedenrij combined metropolitan area has about two million inhabitants.

== Etymology ==
The name may derive from the contraction of the regional words &quot;eind&quot; (meaning &quot;last&quot; or &quot;end&quot;) and &quot;hove&quot; (or &quot;hoeve&quot;, a section of some 14 hectares of land). Toponymically, &quot;eind&quot; occurs commonly as a prefix and postfix in local place- and street names. A &quot;hove&quot; comprised a parcel of land which a local lord might lease to private persons (such as farmers). Given that a string of such parcels existed around Woensel, the name &quot;Eindhoven&quot; may have originated with the meaning literally &quot;last hoves on the land of Woensel&quot; in Dutch language.

Another explanation is that &quot;Eind&quot; is derived from &quot;Gender&quot;, the city is located at the end of this little river. Genderhoven phonetically would have changed to Endehoven. &#x27;Ende&#x27; is also the old spelling and pronunciation of the word &#x27;eind&#x27;, which would explain the change from &#x27;Gender&#x27; to &#x27;Eind&#x27;.

==History==
=== 13th–15th centuries ===
The written history of Eindhoven started in 1232, when Duke Hendrik I of Brabant granted city rights to &quot;Eindhoven&quot;, then a small town right on the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. At the time of granting of its charter, Eindhoven had approximately 170 houses enclosed by a rampart. Just outside the city walls stood a small castle. The city was also granted the right to organize a weekly market and the farmers in nearby villages were obliged to come to Eindhoven to sell their produce. Another factor in its establishment was its location on the trade route from Holland to Liège.

Around 1388, the city&#x27;s fortifications were strengthened further. And between 1413 and 1420, a new castle was built within the city walls. In 1486, Eindhoven was plundered and burned by troops from Guelders.

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
The reconstruction of Eindhoven was finished in 1502, with a stronger rampart and a new castle. However, in 1543 it fell again, its defense works having been neglected due to poverty.

A big fire in 1554 destroyed 75% of the houses but by 1560 these had been rebuilt with the help of William I of Orange. During the Dutch Revolt, Eindhoven changed hands between the Dutch and the Spanish several times during which it was burned down by renegade Spanish soldiers, until finally in 1583 it was captured once more by Spanish troops and its city walls were demolished.

Eindhoven did not become part of the Netherlands until 1629. During the French occupation, Eindhoven suffered again with many of its houses destroyed by the invading forces. Eindhoven remained a minor city after that until the start of the Industrial Revolution.

=== 19th century ===
The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century provided a major growth impulse. Canals, roads and railroads were constructed. Eindhoven was connected to the major Zuid-Willemsvaart canal through the Eindhovens Kanaal branch in 1843 and was connected by rail to Tilburg, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Venlo and Belgium between 1866 and 1870. Industrial activities initially centred around tobacco and textiles and boomed with the rise of lighting and electronics giant Philips, which was founded as a light bulb manufacturing company in Eindhoven in 1891.

Industrialisation brought population growth to Eindhoven. On the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, Eindhoven had 2,310 inhabitants.

=== 20th century ===
By 1920, the population was 47,946; by 1925 it was 63,870 and in 1935 that had ballooned to 103,030. The explosive growth of industry in the region and the subsequent housing needs of workers called for radical changes in administration, as the City of Eindhoven was still confined to its medieval moat city limits. In 1920, the five neighbouring municipalities of Woensel (to the north), Tongelre (northeast and east), Stratum (southeast), Gestel en Blaarthem (southwest) and Strijp (west), which already bore the brunt of the housing needs and related problems, were incorporated into the new Groot-Eindhoven (&quot;Greater Eindhoven&quot;) municipality. The prefix &quot;Groot-&quot; was later dropped.

After the incorporation of 1920, the five former municipalities became districts of the Municipality of Eindhoven, with Eindhoven-Centrum (the City proper) forming the sixth. Since then, an additional seventh district has been formed by dividing the largest district, that of Woensel, into Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord.

The early 20th century saw additions in technical industry with the advent of car and truck manufacturing company Van Doorne&#x27;s Aanhangwagenfabriek (Trailer factory) (DAF) which was later renamed to Van Doorne&#x27;s Automobiel Fabriek and the subsequent shift towards electronics and engineering, with the traditional tobacco and textile industries waning and finally disappearing in the 1970s.


A first air raid in World War II was flown by the RAF on 6 December 1942 targeting the Philips factory downtown, in which 148 civilians died, even though the attack was carried out on a Sunday. Large-scale air raids, including the bombing by the Luftwaffe on 19 September 1944 during Operation Market Garden, destroyed large parts of the city and killed 227 civilians while leaving 800 wounded. The reconstruction that followed left very little historical remains and the postwar reconstruction period saw drastic renovation plans in highrise style, some of which were implemented. At the time, there was little regard for historical heritage. During the 1960s, a new city hall was built and its Neo-gothic predecessor (1867) demolished to make way for a planned arterial road that never materialised.

The 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s saw large-scale housing developments in the districts of Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord, making Eindhoven the fifth-largest city in the Netherlands.

=== 21st century ===
At the start of the 21st century, a whole new housing development called Meerhoven was constructed at the site of the old airport of Welschap, west of Eindhoven. The airport itself, now called Eindhoven Airport, had moved earlier to a new location, paving the way for much-needed new houses. Meerhoven is part of the Strijp district and is partially built on lands annexed from the municipality of Veldhoven.

==Geography==
The villages and city that make up modern Eindhoven were originally built on sandy elevations between the Dommel, Gender and Tongelreep rivers. Beginning in the 19th century, the basins of the rivers themselves have also been used as housing land, resulting in occasional flooding in the city centre. Partly to reduce flooding, the bed of the Gender stream, which flowed directly through the city centre, was dammed off and filled up after the War, and the course of the Dommel was regulated. New ecological and socio-historical insights have led to parts of the Dommel&#x27;s course being restored to their original states, and plans to have the Gender flow through the centre once again.

The large-scale housing developments of the 20th century saw residential areas being built on former agricultural lands and woods, former heaths that had been turned into cultivable lands in the 19th century.

The city is currently divided into seven districts:
===Climate===
Eindhoven has an oceanic climate with slightly warmer summers and colder winters than the coastal parts of the Netherlands. Its all-time record is set on 25 July 2019 and set on 13 January 1968, while winter lows have dipped below during extreme cold snaps. Although frosts are frequent in winter, there is no lasting snow cover in a normal winter due to the mild daytime temperatures.
==Demographics==
===Population===
, the population of Eindhoven consisted of 246,443 people (according to AlleCijfers.nl). Of these, 43% or some 104,804 people were of (partial) foreign descent in 2023.

People are classified as being of foreign descent when they were born outside of the Netherlands, or when at least one of their parents was born outside of the Netherlands.

The municipal agglomeration of Eindhoven (an administrative construct which includes only some of the surrounding towns and villages) has 327,245 inhabitants as of 1 January 2010.

The spoken language is a combination of Kempenlands (a Dutch dialect spoken in a large area east and south east of the city, including Arendonk and Lommel in Belgium) and North Meierijs (between the south of Den Bosch and into Eindhoven). Both dialects belong to the East Brabantian dialect group), which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

=== Inhabitants by origin ===
===Districts===
Of all Eindhoven districts, the historical centre is by far the smallest in size and population, numbering only 5,419 in 2006. Woensel-Noord is the largest, having been the city&#x27;s main area of expansion for several decades.

Population figures for all districts, as of 1 January 2008, ranked by size:

#Woensel-Noord (65,429)
#Woensel-Zuid (35,789)
#Stratum (31,778)
#Gestel (26,590)
#Strijp (25,402)
#Tongelre (19,680)
#Centrum (5,757)

===Religion===
Eindhoven is located in the southeast of the province of North Brabant. This area is historically Catholic and the population of Eindhoven was similarly mostly Catholic for a very long time until the late 1970s. However, the internationalizing influence of the university, Philips and other companies have created a more mixed population over the last few decades.

The spiritual needs of the Eindhoven population are tended to by a steadily shrinking number of churches, two mosques and one synagogue.

===Crime===
In research by the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad based on the police&#x27;s statistical data on crime rates, Eindhoven was found to have the highest crime rate in the Netherlands for 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. In 2011, Eindhoven has slipped down the list to number six.

In 2009, in the Eindhoven agglomeration, the following numbers of crimes were recorded:

===Languages===
* Standard Dutch
* Eindhoven does not have its own, uniform dialect. Varieties of the Brabantian dialect used to be spoken in the former villages of Gestel, Woensel and Stratum, but are now almost extinct. The closest city to Eindhoven in which Brabantian is spoken is Helmond.

==Economy==
Eindhoven has grown from a small town in 1232 to one of the biggest cities in the Netherlands with over 240,000 inhabitants in 2022. Much of its growth is due to Philips, DAF Trucks and Brabantia. Among recent high-tech companies based in Eindhoven are NXP Semiconductors, Sendcloud, and Signify.

After the resurrection of the Netherlands in 1815 and the end of the Belgian Revolution, Eindhoven was a small village of some 1250 people in an economically backward and mostly agricultural area. Cheap land, cheap labor and the existence of pre-industrial homesourcing (&quot;huisnijverheid&quot; in Dutch) made Eindhoven an attractive area for the developing industries which were being stimulated by the government of King William I. During the 19th century, Eindhoven grew into an industrial town with factories for textile weaving, cigar manufacturing, match making and hat making. Most of these industries disappeared again after World War II, though.
In 1891, brothers Gerard and Anton Philips founded the small light bulb factory that would grow into one of the largest electronics firms in the world. Philips&#x27; presence is probably the largest single contributing factor to the major growth of Eindhoven in the 20th century. It attracted and spun off many hi-tech companies, making Eindhoven a major technology and industrial hub. In 2005, a full third of the total amount of money spent on research in the Netherlands was spent in or around Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in technology and ICT, with companies such as FEI Company (once Philips Electron Optics), NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors), ASML, ALTEN, Simac, Neways Electronics and the aforementioned Philips and DAF.

Eindhoven has long been a centre of cooperation between research institutes and industry. This tradition started with Philips (the NatLab was a physical expression of this) and has since expanded to large cooperative networks. The Eindhoven University of Technology hosts an incubator for technology startups and the NatLab has developed into the High Tech Campus Eindhoven. Also, TNO has opened a branch on the university campus. This tradition has also fostered inter-industry cooperation in the region; one example of this is the announcement in September 2010 of a new research lab for high-grade packaging materials, a cooperation of IPS Packaging and Thales Cryogenics.

This cooperative tradition has also developed into a different direction than the traditional technology research done at the university. Starting in 2002, the university, the Catharina hospital, Philips Medical and the University of Maastricht joined forces and started joint research into biomedical science, technology and engineering. Within Eindhoven, this research has been concentrated in a new university faculty (BioMedical Technology or BMT). This development has also made Eindhoven a biomedical technology hub within the country and its (European) region.
Prime examples of industrial heritage in Eindhoven are the renovated Witte Dame (&quot;White Lady&quot;) complex, a former Philips lamp factory; and the Admirant building (informally known as Bruine Heer or &quot;Brown Gentleman&quot; in reference to the Witte Dame across the street), the former Philips main offices. The Witte Dame currently houses the municipal library, the Design Academy and a selection of shops. The Admirant has been renovated into an Office building for small companies. Across the street from the Witte Dame and next to the Admirant is Philips&#x27; first light bulb factory (nicknamed Roze Baby, or &quot;Pink Baby&quot;, in reference to its pink colour and much smaller size when compared to the &quot;White Lady&quot; and &quot;Brown Gentleman&quot;). The small building now houses the &quot;Centrum Kunstlicht in de Kunst&quot; (centre artificial light in art) and the &quot;Philips Incandescent Lamp Factory of 1891&quot; museum.

===Knowledge economy initiatives===
Due to its high-tech environment, Eindhoven is part of several initiatives to develop, foster and increase a knowledge economy. Chief among these are:

*Brainport Top Technology Region, a cooperative initiative of local government, industry and the Eindhoven University of Technology to develop the local knowledge economy of the Eindhoven region.
*Brainport Development, an extension of the Top Technology Region, Brainport Development serves as the Eindhoven&#x27;s regional innovation agency to maintain its position as an innovation hub.
*Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven, a cooperative agreement among the municipalities in the Eindhoven metropolitan area.
*The Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle, a cooperation agreement between the universities and surrounding regions of Eindhoven, Leuven (Belgium) and Aachen (Germany).

The Intelligent Community Forum named the Eindhoven metro region the No. 21 intelligent community in 2008 and the No. 7 intelligent community in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, the ICF named Eindhoven the Intelligent Community of the Year. Since 2012, Eindhoven has vanished from the top 7 of intelligent communities.

===EIT co-location===
Eindhoven is one of the co-location centres of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). It hosts two Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs): Innoenergy (Sustainable Energy) and EIT ICT Labs (Information and Communication Technology). The co-locations are on the High Tech Campus Eindhoven.

==Education==
Eindhoven, being a city with a 240,000+ population, is served by a large number of schools both at primary and secondary education levels. In addition, Eindhoven is a higher-education hub within the southern Netherlands, with several institutes of higher education that serve students from the extended region of North Brabant, Zeeland, Limburg and parts of the surrounding provinces.

===Primary education===
Primary education is provided to the children aged 4 to 12 in Eindhoven through a large number of primary schools:
*Special needs primary education:
**SALTO school Jan Nieuwenhuizen
**SKPO school De Reis van Brandaan
**SKPO school Petraschool
**SALTO school De Vijfkamp

===Secondary education===
Secondary education is provided to the children aged 12 to 18 in Eindhoven through several highschools:
Special needs secondary education:
*Sondervickcollege, Locatie de Stolberg
*De Korenaer
*Mgr. Bekkers
*De Beemden
*Mytylschool
*Antoon Schellens College
*Praktijkschool Eindhoven
*VSO Ekkersbeek
*Instituut &#x27;St. Marie&#x27;

===Higher and adult education===
Eindhoven hosts four different public institutions for higher and adult education, as well as a number of private institutions offering courses and trainings. The public institutions hosted in Eindhoven are:

*Design Academy.
*Eindhoven University of Technology.
*Fontys University of Applied Sciences (Eindhoven branch).
*Tio University
*

The Open University also has a study center in Eindhoven.

Among the private institutions is the Centrum voor Kunsten Eindhoven, which offers art-related courses to adults (including a DJ-education).

== Politics ==
=== Municipal council ===
The municipal council is the legislative council at the municipal level in Eindhoven; its existence is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands. The Eindhoven city council consists of 45 elected representatives from the Eindhoven municipality. These are elected during municipal elections from candidates running in Eindhoven. Eindhoven politics consists of local branches of the national political parties and purely local parties with strictly local interests. The city council reflects this mix in its makeup.

The division of the municipal seats in the Eindhoven city council after the elections is shown below:

=== Municipal executive ===

==== Alder(wo)men ====
The executive council in Dutch municipalities is called the &quot;College of the Mayor and Aldermen&quot; (Dutch: &quot;College van Burgemeester en Wethouders&quot; or &quot;College van B&amp;W&quot; for short). The mayor is appointed by the monarch, but the council of aldermen is composed as a result of the formation of a local coalition government. This coalition is formed in such a way as to be able to rely on a majority of the votes in the city council.

;2014 – 2018
In May 2014, a coalition was formed between PvdA, D66, SP, and GreenLeft. Together they had 26 seats in the city council. The council of alder(wo)men consisted of the following people:

* Staf Depla (PvdA): economy, work and income and vocational education
* Yasin Torunoglu (PvdA): living, boroughs, space and citizen participation
* Marco van Dorst replaced by Wilbert Seuren in July 2015 (both D66): spatial planning and treasury
* Mary-Ann Schreurs (D66): innovation and design, sustainability and culture
* Bianca van Kaathoven (SP): active city, diversity and permits
*Jannie Visscher (SP): youth, education, traffic and transport
* Lenie Scholten (GreenLeft): health care and WIJeindhoven

;2018 – 2022
In May 2018, a coalition was formed existing of VVD, GreenLeft, PvdA, and CDA. They had 26 seats together. The alder(wo)men were:
* Monique List (VVD)
* Marcel Oosterveer (VVD)
* Renate Richters (GreenLeft)
* Jan van der Veer replaced by Rik Thijs in June 2019 (both GreenLeft)
* Yasin Torunoglu (PvdA)
* Stijn Steenbakkers (CDA)

;2022 – 2026
In June 2022, a coalition has been formed existing of GreenLeft, CDA, PvdA, and D66, having 25 seats together. Their alder(wo)men have been:
* Saskia Lammers (GreenLeft): well-being, work, poverty, culture and design
* Rik Thijs (GreenLeft): climate, energy, soil and greening
* Samir Toub (GreenLeft): diversity, care, youth and social support
* Maes van Lanschot (CDA): finance, sport, heritage and regional cooperation
* Stijn Steenbakkers (CDA): brainport, economy, education, KnoopXL and Eindhoven-Northwest
* Mieke Verhees (PvdA): housing, neighbourhoods, space and services
* Monique Esselbrugge (D66): higher and vocational education, mobility, city center and Design District

==== Mayor ====

The mayors of the Netherlands are not elected but appointed by the crown. Nevertheless, there has been a movement over the last few years to give the municipalities more say in who will be their mayor, which has resulted in consultative referendums being held in the larger cities to &quot;suggest&quot; a candidate for the post. This was also tried in Eindhoven.

On 23 January 2008, a referendum to elect a mayor was held in Eindhoven. This referendum, the second of its kind in the Netherlands, was attended by 24.6% of the inhabitants. This was less than the required 30% needed to make a referendum binding. Nevertheless, the city council would choose the winner of the referendum as the preferred candidate. The main reason for the low attendance was that the candidates, Leen Verbeek and Rob van Gijzel, were from the same party (PvdA). Rob van Gijzel won the referendum with 61.8% of the votes and was appointed the city&#x27;s new mayor.

The mayor is the chairman of the Council of B&amp;W. He also has responsibility for a number of specific posts (like the aldermen). For example, in the executive council of 2014-2018 mayor Van Gijzel held responsibility for the post of communication.

If unavailable, the mayor is temporarily replaced by one of the aldermen.

Rob van Gijzel was succeeded by John Jorritsma (VVD) on 13 September 2016. Jorritsma has been succeeded by Jeroen Dijsselbloem (PvdA) on 13 September 2022.

==Culture and recreation==
Culturally and recreationally, Eindhoven was formed by two forces:

*Being a university city, Eindhoven has a large student population. The students from the Eindhoven University of Technology and a number of undergraduate schools give Eindhoven a young population, whose recreational needs are catered to by several different festivals, clubs and such.
*For a long time Eindhoven was the main location of Philips. The Philips company undertook a lot of effort in the &quot;cultural formation&quot; of its workforce and has given the city both cultural institutions (such as the former POC and the Muziekcentrum Frits Philips) and sporting institutions (notably PSV).

Eindhoven is also known as the City of Light, due to Philips originating from there and because of several projects involving lighting up buildings of the city. During Carnival, Eindhoven is rechristened &quot;Lampegat&quot; (Hamlet of Lamps, although for the ironic purposes of carnival the translation &quot;Hole in the ground with lamps&quot; is closer to the mark); this refers again to the important role of Philips in the Eindhoven community.

===Cultural institutions===
There are several cultural institutions in and around the city.

====Museums====
*There are two museums dedicated to the major topics of the city&#x27;s industrial heritage: the DAF Museum has a collection of DAF cars and the Philips Gloeilampenfabriekje anno 1891 (across the street from the Kempenland) documents the early lightbulb industry.
*The former district court house now houses the Designhuis, a public podium and interaction area for modern design and innovation.
*The Eindhoven Museum is an archaeological open-air museum which focuses on the region&#x27;s Iron Age and Middle Ages. It merged in 2011 with Museum Kempenland which was a regional museum, which documents the history of the Kempenland region in objects, documents, paintings and educational activities. Museum Kempenland&#x27;s old location, the Steentjeskerk, is closed.
*The Inkijkmuseum (the &quot;Look-In museum&quot;; housed in an old linen factory in the Dommelstraat) is a small but special museum: it offers ever-changing exhibits, which are to be viewed through the building&#x27;s windows.
*The Van Abbemuseum has a collection of modern and contemporary art, including works by Picasso, Kandinsky, Mondriaan and Chagall.
* De Ontdekfabriek (Discovery Factory) children&#x27;s museum at Strijp-S

Eindhoven was home to the Evoluon science museum, sponsored by Philips. The Evoluon building has evolved into a conference centre.

====Open-air art====
The Eindhoven public space contains many forms of artistic expression (a book published by the Eindhoven tourist board records 550 and more have been added since), with high &quot;concentrations&quot; of them in the parks. The Stadswandelpark for instance, contains over 30 works of modern art. There are also several other works of art on permanent display throughout the city, such as &quot;Flying Pins&quot; (by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, who considered the location on the southern stretch of the John F. Kennedylaan to be like a bowling alley) and &quot;Swing&quot; (a construct on the Karel de Grotelaan, which morphs into different geometric shapes as you move around it). There are also a number of statues of famous city inhabitants, such as Jan van Hooff (by Auke Hettema, 1992) and Frits Philips (by Kees Verkade) on the Market Square. There is a statue of Anton Philips in front of the central railway station.
Eindhoven is also, to some degree, open to forms of impromptu and alternative art. For example, the Berenkuil is a freezone for graffiti artists in the city.

===== Light art =====
Strijp-S is a place for experimentation with LED lighting, which keeps the historic connection with Philips&#x27; past. Some light art includes the project Fakkel by Har Hollands. In the underground passage to NatLab artist Daan Roosegaarde installed his project Crystal.

Strijp-S is a regular location for the light festival GLOW.

====Music and theatre====
The Effenaar is a popular music venue and cultural center in Eindhoven, and is located at the Dommelstraat.

In 1992, the Muziekcentrum Frits Philips was opened as a stage for classical and popular music in Eindhoven, reviewed by critics as a concert hall with acoustics that rival the best halls in Europe. Before that, Philips sponsored the POC.

Parktheater Eindhoven is Eindhoven&#x27;s stage for opera, cabaret, ballet etc. Opened in 1964, it has received over 250,000 visitors every year. With its 1,000 m2 it has one of the largest stages in the Netherlands. With a major renovation ending in 2007, the new Parktheater will receive an estimated 300,000 visitors a year.

Eindhoven&#x27;s Plaza Futura is now a cinema featuring cultural movies, lectures and special cultural events.

Especially for students, Studium Generale Eindhoven organizes &quot;socially, culturally and intellectually formative events&quot;. From within the student body, two Tunas provide entertainment from time to time at university and city events: Tuna Ciudad de Luz (&quot;Tuna of the City of Light&quot;) and the ladies tuna La Tuniña.

The general music and theatre scene in Eindhoven (in the broadest sense) is supported by a foundation called PopEi. The purpose of this foundation is to support artistic groups with facilities, especially rehearsal stages and areas (housed in the old Philips location of Strijp-S) but also storage facilities. PopEi also provides a working environment for groups (through cafeteria facilities in Strijp-S, so groups can have real working days) and provides some logistical support for organizing events.

===Recreation===
Eindhoven has a lively recreational scene. For going out, there are numerous bars on the Market square, Stratumseind (Stratum&#x27;s End) which is the largest pub-street in the Netherlands, Dommelstraat, Wilhelmina square and throughout the rest of the city. In addition to the more culturally oriented Plaza Futura, there are three cinemas in the centre of town (&quot;Servicebioscoop Zien&quot;, &quot;Vue&quot; and Pathé Eindhoven, which offers THX sound, IMAX screens and 3D movie viewing).

<text>Helsingør ( , ; ), classically known in English as Elsinore ( ), is a coastal city in northeastern Denmark. Helsingør Municipality had a population of 63,838 on 1 January 2024, making it the 23rd most populated municipality in Denmark. Helsingør is located at the narrowest part of the Øresund strait and together with Helsingborg in Sweden, forms the northern reaches of the Øresund Region, centred on Copenhagen and Malmö. Helsingør is a ferry city with frequent departures with the HH Ferry route which connects Helsingør with Helsingborg, across the Øresund.

Its castle Kronborg was used by William Shakespeare as the setting for his play &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The first part of the name, &quot;Hels&quot;, is believed to derive from the word &quot;hals&quot; &#x27;neck; narrow strait&#x27;, referring to the narrowest point of the Øresund (Øre Sound) between what is now Helsingør and Helsingborg in Sweden. The word &quot;Helsing&quot; supposedly means &#x27;person/people who live by the neck&#x27; and &quot;ør&quot; corresponds to old Norse &quot;aurr&quot; &#x27;gravel beach&#x27; and &quot;&quot; &#x27;sandy or gravelly shore&#x27;. The city was first mentioned as &quot;Hælsingør&quot; and the people as &quot;Helsinger&quot; in King Valdemar the Victorious&#x27;s &quot;Liber Census Daniæ&quot; from 1231 (not to be confused with the Helsings of Hälsingland in Sweden). Place names show that the Helsinger may have had their main fort at Helsingborg and a fortified landing place at Helsingør, to control the ferry route across the strait. The particularly 19th-century tradition to explain toponymies, place names, with features of the landscape does not necessarily exclude the much older tradition of reading place names as eponymous. Although an obscure legendary character, or several, Helsing is quite abundantly present in traces of lost legends in the Nordic countries.

Although probably not the first Helsing, one of the three sons of Gandalf Alfgeirsson (the antagonist of Halfdan the Black, who was father of King Harald Fairhair, the semi-legendary, historical first king of a feudalist Norway) is called Helsing. He was brother to Hake and Hysing Gandalfson. Also Helsinki in Finland and Hälsingland in Norrland, Sweden, refers to Helsing, as &quot;the Land of the Helsing/Helsinger,&quot; which makes the landscape theory of the name of Helsingør less likely.

==History==


The city as it is known today was founded in the 1420s by Danish King Eric of Pomerania. He established the Sound Dues in 1429, which were a toll on the use of the Øresund. Although a former toll had existed prior, the Sound Dues were paid in Helsingør providing immense wealth to the city. With the income, the king built a castle named Krogen or Ørekrog on the extreme northeastern tip of the island of Zealand. The city expanded around the castle and envelops it today. Krogen was rebuilt and expanded in the 1570s by king Frederik II and renamed Kronborg. All ships had to stop in Helsingør to get their cargo taxed and pay a toll to the Danish Crown, which generated a significant trade for the city. In 1672, Helsingør had grown to be the third-largest town in Denmark. Up until the middle of the 19th century, Helsingør was among the largest cities in the country.

The Sound Dues were abolished in 1857 with the Copenhagen Convention in which all seafaring nations agreed to pay a one-time fee. The abolishment was a huge loss for the city; the following decades saw a slow growth in population.

The oldest known fortified building of Helsingør is &quot;Flynderborg&quot;, an early medieval fortress on a hill just south of the medieval city.

Around 1200, the first church, Saint Olaf&#x27;s Church, was built.

A number of convents once surrounded the church, but now all that remains is the church building, today the cathedral of the Diocese of Helsingør. The oldest parts of the cathedral of Helsingør date back to the 13th century and show that the fishing village, as Helsingør was then, had grown to a town of importance.

Johan Isaksson Pontanus (&quot;Rerum Danicarum Historica&quot;, 1631) attributes a long and partially-fictitious history to Helsingør.

During World War II, Helsingør was among the most important transport points for the rescue of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population during the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler had ordered that all Danish Jews were to be arrested and deported to the concentration camps on Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish New Year, which fell on 2 October 1943. When Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, a diplomatic attaché of Nazi Germany to Denmark, received word of the order on 28 September 1943, he shared it with political and Jewish community leaders. Using the name Elsinore Sewing Club (Danish: &quot;Helsingør Syklub&quot;) as a cover for messages, the Danish population formed an Underground Railroad of sorts that moved Jews away from the closely watched Copenhagen docks to spots further away, especially Helsingør, just two miles across the Øresund to Helsingborg, in neutral Sweden. Hundreds of civilians hid their fellow Danish Jewish citizens in their houses, farm lofts and churches until they could board them onto Danish fishing boats, personal pleasure boats and ferry boats. Over the course of three nights, Danes had smuggled over 7,200 Jews and 680 non-Jews (family members of Jews or political activists) across the Øresund to safety in Helsingborg and Malmö in Sweden.

==Transport==
The car ferry line between Helsingør and Helsingborg, Scania, Sweden is the busiest in the world with more than 70 departures in each direction every day. The route is known as the HH Ferry route and has been sailed by several shipping lines throughout history. The Helsingør ferry terminal is connected to the town&#x27;s main railway station. From the station, trains depart to Copenhagen every 20 minutes. Trains also depart to Hillerød and Gilleleje. There are another six stations or train stops within the city and connected suburbs. Apart from &quot;Helsingør Station and Ferry Terminal&quot; also &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and the train stops on the line to Gilleleje, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;.

The E47 motorway towards Copenhagen begins just outside the city limits. The town and surrounding areas also have a network of local and regional buses.

==Industrialisation==
For a century the Helsingør Værft or Elsinore shipyard was a prominent landmark, which covered the whole area between the town and Kronborg Castle. It was founded in 1882. At its height in 1957, it had 3,600 employees. The last ship left the shipyard in 1983 and it closed the same year following substantial losses.

The Wiibroe brewery, founded in 1840, was the second brewery in Denmark to ship bottled beer, just three years after Carlsberg. The last beer was brewed at Wiibroe in Helsingør in 1998. Carlsberg continues to brew beer under the Wiibroe Årgangsøl label.

==Post-industrialisation==

After the end of the industrial era, the town of Helsingør had to redefine itself, and came up with an ambitious project: Kulturhavn Kronborg, literally &quot;Culture-harbour of Kronborg&quot;. It officially opened on 26 May 2013, intended to appeal to tourists with an interest in culture. The main attraction of Kulturhavn Kronborg is Kronborg Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Besides the historical attractions of the site, William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot; has been performed annually in its courtyard since 1937. There is a longstanding tradition of performing the play in English, and notable actors in the title role have included Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Christopher Plummer, Derek Jacobi, and in 2009 Jude Law. At the heart of Kulturhavn Kronborg lies kulturværftet or The Culture Yard, a new cultural centre and a public library located in the old dockyard. It opened in 2010. The former dry dock now houses the Danish Maritime Museum.

In the centre of the harbour basin stands the polished steel sculpture &quot;Han&quot; (&quot;He&quot;) by artist duo Elmgreen and Dragset, commissioned by the City of Helsingør in 2012. It was inaugurated by then Minister of culture, Uffe Elbæk, in June 2012. It is seen as the counterpart (and even little brother) to Edvard Eriksen&#x27;s world-famous &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; statue in Copenhagen, and has caused both praise and protests among locals.

The Swedish city of Helsingborg lies a short distance across the Øresund from Helsingør, approximately . European route E55 joins the two cities; ferries connect the two sides.

==Music==

Dieterich Buxtehude organist and composer of the Baroque period. 
He was born Diderich Buxtehude presumably in Helsingborg, he serving as organist from 1660 to 1668 in Helsingør as his father that held the position as organist at St. Olaf&#x27;s cathedral.

Diderich Buxtehude&#x27;s compositions and style became of significant influence, among others, on his student Johann Sebastian Bach.

==Architecture==

The new Danish Maritime Museum was designed by Danish prize-winning architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG).

Jørn Utzon lived in Helsingør in his youth because his father was an engineer at Helsingør Værft. Utzon designed : His own house (1952), The Kingo Houses (1956–60) and The Hammershøj Care Centre (1962) in the city. The project was completed by Birger Schmidt (1966) after Utzon moved to Sydney to work on the Sydney Opera House.

<text>European route E4 passes from north to south through Sweden from the border with Finland, with a total length of . The Finnish part lies entirely within Tornio in northern Finland, and is only long. The Swedish part traverses most of Sweden except the extreme north and the west coast region, and is commonly considered the highway backbone of Sweden, since it passes in the vicinity of many of its largest cities and through the capital Stockholm. In particular, it is the mainline road used by most vehicle traffic, both cars and lorries, between the north (Norrland) and south of Sweden or beyond.

From Haparanda on the Finnish border, it stretches south along the Gulf of Bothnia to Gävle, then on a more inland route southwards. It ends in Helsingborg in Sweden, at the port for the ferry to Helsingør in Denmark. The route intersects with European route E6 just outside Helsingborg, which continues to Trelleborg on the southern coast of Sweden.

== History and naming ==
The International E-road network convention was signed in 1950, with the E4 routed Lisbon-Madrid-Barcelona-Nimes-Geneva-Basel-Frankfurt-Hamburg-Helsingør-Stockholm-Haparanda-Helsinki. The part in Sweden was signposted E4 in 1962. Until 1962, the road Helsingborg–Stockholm was called highway 1, and Stockholm–Haparanda highway 13.
Under the new system of European routes which was decided in 1975, but introduced in Sweden in 1992, it was planned to have been a part of E55, but it retains the pre-1992 designation (E4) within Sweden, because the expenses connected with re-signing this long road portion would be too great. Besides the signs along the road, there are thousands of signs, especially in cities, showing how to reach the E4 road. The road is now fully authorised as E4 by the relevant authority, not as E55.

== Route ==
North of Gävle the road is of mixed standard. Depending on the fashion at the time of construction, it is either a single standard carriageway road, usually wide, or a 2+1 road, a wide road with two lanes in one direction and one in the other with a steel wire barrier in between, or sometimes a motorway with two lanes in each direction. North of Sundsvall, the road passes through several of the larger cities as city streets.

South of Gävle, the road becomes an almost continuous motorway, with the only non-motorway part being a long section past Ljungby, currently a 2+1 limited-access road. Upgrade to motorway standard will start in 2018. Construction was restarted in 2022, with the expectation to finish it in 2024. With the exception of the Ljungby bypass, the final stretch of the motorway to be opened was the road between Uppsala and Mehedeby, which was inaugurated on 17 October 2007. South of Gävle, the speed limit is on 60% and on 30% of the road. North of Gävle there are varying speed limits, with as the most common. The speed limits on the main roads in Sweden were changed on many stretches in October 2008, which saw the introduction of the 120 km/h limit.

The E4 is the fastest road to go from Germany/Denmark to areas north of the Arctic Circle, including places in Norway such as Tromsø or the North Cape.

<doc id="9424" wikidata="Q52618" url="?curid=9424" title="Ericsson">
<text>(), commonly known as Ericsson (), is a Swedish multinational networking and telecommunications company headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company sells infrastructure, software, and services in information and communications technology for telecommunications service providers and enterprises, including, among others, 3G, 4G, and 5G equipment, and Internet Protocol (IP) and optical transport systems. The company employs around 100,000 people and operates in more than 180 countries. Ericsson has over 57,000 granted patents.

Ericsson has been a major contributor to the development of the telecommunications industry and is one of the leaders in 5G.

The company was founded in 1876 by Lars Magnus Ericsson and is jointly controlled by the Wallenberg family through its holding company Investor AB, and the universal bank Handelsbanken through its investment company Industrivärden. The Wallenbergs and the Handelsbanken sphere acquired their voting-strong A-shares, and thus the control of Ericsson, after the fall of the Kreuger empire in the early 1930s.

Ericsson is the inventor of Bluetooth technology.

==History==
===Foundation===
Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm that made telegraph equipment for the Swedish government agency Telegrafverket. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson in central Stockholm and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878, Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878, he agreed to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden&#x27;s first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.

===International expansion===
As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK (Ericsson Telephones Ltd.) and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established to improve the chances of gaining local contracts and augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the National Telephone Company was a major customer; by 1897 sold 28% of its output in the UK. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.

Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson&#x27;s largest non-European markets. Mass production techniques were now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.

Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales in the United States. AT&amp;T’s Western Electric Company (via the Bell System), Kellogg and Automatic Electric dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.

===Automatic equipment===

Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world&#x27;s markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson&#x27;s catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases. World War I, the subsequent Great Depression and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company&#x27;s development while sales to other countries fell by about half.

===Shareholding changes===
The acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson&#x27;s finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed &quot;Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson&quot;. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.

===Wallenberg era begins===
Ericsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including Stockholms Enskilda Bank (now Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family, and some Swedish government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr. negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson &quot;A&quot; shares, while International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family bought ITT&#x27;s shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.

===Market development===

In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one-third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.

===Further development===
Ericsson introduced the world&#x27;s first fully automatic mobile telephone system, MTA, in 1956. It released one of the world&#x27;s first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s. In 1954, it released the Ericofon. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment was used in telephone administrations in many countries. In 1983 the company introduced the ERIPAX suite of network products and services.

===Emergence of the Internet (1995–2003)===
In the 1990s, during the emergence of the Internet, Ericsson was regarded as slow to realize its potential and falling behind in the area of IP technology. But the company had established an Internet project in 1995 called Infocom Systems to exploit opportunities leading from fixed-line telecom and IT. CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas – Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems – &quot;we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)&quot;.
The growth of GSM, which became a &quot;de facto&quot; world standard, combined with Ericsson&#x27;s other mobile standards, such as D-AMPS and PDC, meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world&#x27;s mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188 million AXE lines in place or on order in 117 countries. Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the WCDMA (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT Docomo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999 when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm&#x27;s wireless infrastructure business and some R&amp;D resources.

Ericsson issued a profit warning in March 2001. Over the coming year, sales to operators halved. Mobile telephones became a burden; the company&#x27;s telephones unit made a loss of SEK 24 billion in 2000. A fire in a Philips chip factory in New Mexico in March 2000 caused severe disruption to Ericsson&#x27;s phone production, dealing a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; to Ericsson&#x27;s mobile phone hopes. Mobile phones would be spun off into a joint venture with Sony, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in October 2001.
Ericsson launched several rounds of restructuring, refinancing and job-cutting; during 2001, staff numbers fell from 107,000 to 85,000. A further 20,000 went the next year, and 11,000 more in 2003. A new rights issue raised SEK 30 billion to keep the company afloat. The company had survived as mobile Internet started growing. With record profits, it was in better shape than many of its competitors.

===Rebuilding and growing (2003–2018)===
The emergence of full mobile Internet began a period of growth for the global telecom industry, including Ericsson. After the launch of 3G services in 2003, people started to access the Internet using their telephones.

Ericsson was working on ways to improve WCDMA as operators were buying and rolling it out; it was the first generation of 3G access. New advances included IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and the next evolution of WCDMA, called High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). It was initially deployed in the download version called HSDPA; the technology spread from the first test calls in the US in late 2005 to 59 commercial networks in September 2006. HSPA would provide the world&#x27;s first mobile broadband.

In July 2016, Hans Vestberg stepped down as Ericsson&#x27;s CEO after heading the company for six years. Jan Frykhammar, who had been working for the company since 1991 stepped in as interim CEO while Ericsson searched for a full-time replacement. On 16 January 2017, following Ericsson&#x27;s announcement on 26 October 2016, new CEO Börje Ekholm started and interim CEO Jan Frykhammar stepped down the following day.

In June 2018, Ericsson, Inc. and Ericsson AB have agreed to pay $145,893 to settle potential civil liability for an apparent violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 538 (SSR).1

===Acquisitions and cooperation===
Around 2000, companies and governments began to push for standards for mobile Internet. In May 2000, the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative, a consortium of four telecommunications suppliers in Europe – Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel (France) and Siemens (Germany) – to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. Later that year, the consortium partners invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum in 2001. In December 1999, Microsoft
and Ericsson announced a strategic partnership to combine the former&#x27;s web browser and server software with the latter&#x27;s mobile-internet technologies. In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst with marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world&#x27;s largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country&#x27;s Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In the same year, Intel, the world&#x27;s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to Ericsson over the next three years.

The short-lived partnership, called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture, owned 70/30 percent by Ericsson and Microsoft respectively, ended in October 2001 when Ericsson announced it would absorb the former joint venture and adopt a licensing agreement with Microsoft instead. The same month, Ericsson and Sony announced the creation of the mobile phone manufacturing joint venture: Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. Ten years later, in February 2012, Ericsson sold its stake in the joint venture; Ericsson said it wanted to focus on the global wireless market as a whole.

Lower stock prices and job losses affected many telecommunications companies in 2001. The major equipment manufacturers – Motorola (U.S.), Lucent Technologies (U.S.), Cisco Systems (U.S.), Marconi (UK), Siemens (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson – all announced job cuts in their home countries and subsidiaries around the world. Ericsson&#x27;s workforce worldwide fell during 2001 from 107,000 to 85,000.

In September 2001, Ericsson purchased the remaining shares in EHPT from Hewlett-Packard. Founded in 1993, Ericsson Hewlett Packard Telecom (EHPT) was a joint venture made up of 60% Ericsson interests and 40% Hewlett-Packard interests.

In 2002, ICT investor losses topped $2 trillion and share prices fell by 95% until August that year. More than half a million people lost their jobs in the global telecom industry over the two years. The collapse of U.S. carrier WorldCom, with more than $107 billion in assets, was the biggest in U.S. history. The sector&#x27;s problems caused bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of several major companies. Ericsson made 20,000 more staff redundant and raised about $3 billion from its shareholders. In June 2002, Infineon Technologies (then the sixth-largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens) bought Ericsson&#x27;s microelectronics unit for $400 million.

Ericsson was an official backer in the 2005 launch of the .mobi top-level domain created specifically for the mobile internet.

Co-operation with Hewlett-Packard did not end with EHPT; in 2003 Ericsson outsourced its IT to HP, which included Managed Services, Help Desk Support, Data Center Operations, and HP Utility Data Center. The contract was extended in 2008. In October 2005, Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled UK telecommunications manufacturer Marconi Company, including its brand name that dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the &quot;father of radio&quot; Guglielmo Marconi. In September 2006, Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to Saab AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems.

In 2007, Ericsson acquired carrier edge-router maker Redback Networks, and then Entrisphere, a US-based company providing fiber-access technology. In September 2007, Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German customer-care and billing software firm LHS, a stake later raised to 100%. In 2008, Ericsson sold its enterprise PBX division to Aastra Technologies, and acquired Tandberg Television, the television technology division of Norwegian company Tandberg.

In 2009, Ericsson bought the CDMA2000 and LTE business of Nortel&#x27;s carrier networks division for US$1.18 billion; Bizitek, a Turkish business support systems integrator; the Estonian manufacturing operations of electronic manufacturing company Elcoteq; and completed its acquisition of LHS. Acquisitions in 2010 included assets from the Strategy and Technology Group of inCode, a North American business and consulting-services company; Nortel&#x27;s majority shareholding (50% plus one share) in LG-Nortel, a joint venture between LG Electronics and Nortel Networks providing sales, R&amp;D and industrial capacity in South Korea, now known as Ericsson-LG; further Nortel carrier-division assets, relating from Nortel&#x27;s GSM business in the United States and Canada; Optimi Corporation, a U.S.–Spanish telecommunications vendor specializing in network optimization and management; and Pride, a consulting and systems-integration company operating in Italy.

In 2011, Ericsson acquired manufacturing and research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT) as well as Nortel&#x27;s Multiservice Switch business. Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012, an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company. In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company. In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.

On 3 May 2013, Ericsson announced it would divest its power cable operations to Danish company NKT Holding. On 1 July 2013, Ericsson announced it would acquire the media management company Red Bee Media, subject to regulatory approval. The acquisition was completed on 9 May 2014. In September 2013, Ericsson completed its acquisition of Microsoft&#x27;s Mediaroom business and televisions services, originally announced in April the same year. The acquisition makes Ericsson the largest provider of IPTV and multi-screen services in the world, by market share; it was renamed Ericsson Mediaroom. In September 2014, Ericsson acquired majority stake in Apcera for cloud policy compliance. In October 2015, Ericsson completed the acquisition of Envivio, a software encoding company. In April 2016, Ericsson acquired Polish and Ukrainian operations of software development company Ericpol, a long-time supplier to Ericsson. Approximately 2,300 Ericpol employees joined Ericsson, bringing software development competence in radio, cloud, and IP.

On 20 June 2017, Bloomberg disclosed that Ericsson hired Morgan Stanley to explore the sale of its media businesses. The Red Bee Media business was kept in-house as an independent subsidiary company, as no suitable buyer was found, but a 51% stake of the remainder of the Media Solution division was sold to private equity firm One Equity Partners, the new company being named MediaKind. The transaction was completed on 31 January 2019. In February 2018, Ericsson acquired the location-based mobile data management platform Placecast. Ericsson has since integrated Placecast&#x27;s platform and capabilities with its programmatic mobile ad subsidiary, Emodo. In May 2018, SoftBank partnered with Ericsson to trial new radio technology. In September 2020, Ericsson acquired US-based carrier equipment manufacturer Cradlepoint for $1.1 billion.

In November 2021, Ericsson announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Vonage for $6.2 billion. The acquisition completed in July 2022. In January 2024, Ericson and MTN Group announced expansion of their partnership to boost their mobile financial services on Africa market, as the company appointed Michael Wallis-Brown as vice president responsible for global mobile financial services.

In December 2024, Ericsson secured a multi-year extension deal worth billions with Bharti Airtel for the provision of 4G and 5G radio access network products and solutions.

==Research and development==
Ericsson has structured its R&amp;D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users. Its research and development organization is part of &#x27;Group Function Technology&#x27; and addresses several facets of network architecture: wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services software; EMF safety and sustainability; security; and global services. The head of research since 2012 is Sara Mazur.

Group Function Technology holds research co-operations with several major universities and research institutes including Lund University in Sweden, Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary and Beijing Institute of Technology in China. Ericsson also holds research co-operations within several European research programs such as GigaWam and OASE. Ericsson holds 33,000 granted patents and is the number-one holder of GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WCDMA/HSPA, and LTE essential patents. In 2023, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)’s Annual PCT Review ranked Ericsson&#x27;s number of patent applications published under the PCT System as 7th in the world, with 1,863 patent applications being published during 2023.

Ericsson hosts a developer program called Ericsson Developer Connection designed to encourage development of applications and services. Ericsson also has an open innovation initiative for beta applications and beta API&#x27;s &amp; tools called Ericsson Labs. The company hosts several internal innovation competitions among its employees.

In May 2022, it was announced that Ericsson and Intel are pooling R&amp;D excellence to create high-performing Cloud RAN solutions. The organisations have pooled to launch a tech hub in California, USA. The hub focuses on the benefits that Ericsson Cloud RAN and Intel technology can bring to: improving energy efficiency and network performance, reducing time to market, and monetizing new business opportunities such as enterprise applications.

==Products and services==
Ericsson&#x27;s business includes technology research, development, network systems and software development, and running operations for telecom service providers. and software Ericsson offers end-to-end services for all major mobile communication standards, and has three main business units.

===Business Area Networks===
Business Area Networks, previously called Business Unit Networks, develop network infrastructure for communication needs over mobile and fixed connections. Its products include radio base stations, radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Operators use Ericsson products to migrate from 2G to 3G and, most recently, to 4G networks.

The company&#x27;s network division has been described as a driver in the development of 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE and 5G technology, and the evolution towards all-IP, and it develops and deploys advanced LTE systems, but it is still developing the older GSM, WCDMA, and CDMA technologies. The company&#x27;s networks portfolio also includes microwave transport, Internet Protocol (IP) networks, fixed-access services for copper and fiber, and mobile broadband modules, several levels of fixed broadband access, radio access networks from small pico cells to high-capacity macro cells and controllers for radio base stations.

====Network services====
Ericsson&#x27;s network rollout services employ in-house capabilities, subcontractors and central resources to make changes to live networks. Services such as technology deployment, network transformation, support services and network optimization are also provided.

===Business Area Digital Services ===
This unit provides core networks, Operations Support Systems such as network management and analytics, and Business Support Systems such as billing and mediation. Within the Digital Services unit, there is an m-Commerce offering, which focuses on service providers and facilitates their working with financial institutions and intermediaries. Ericsson has announced m-commerce deals with Western Union and African wireless carrier MTN.

===Business Area Managed Services===

On 7 December 2019, Ericsson agreed to pay more than $1.2 billion (€1.09 billion) to settle U.S. Department of Justice FCPA criminal and civil investigations into foreign corruption. US authorities accused the company of conducting a campaign of corruption between 2000 and 2016 across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Kuwait and Djibouti. Ericsson admitted to paying bribes, falsifying books and records and failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls in an attempt to strengthen its position in the telecommunications industry.

In 2022, an internal investigation into corruption inside the company was leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. It detailed corruption in at least 10 countries. Ericsson has admitted &quot;serious breaches of compliance rules&quot;.

The leak also revealed that some subcontractors working on behalf of Ericsson paid bribes to the Islamic State in order to continue operating the telecom network in occupied regions of Iraq.

<text>Ethology is a branch of zoology that studies the behaviour of non-human animals. It has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, the three winners of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Ethology combines laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolutionary biology.

== Etymology ==

The modern term &quot;ethology&quot; derives from the Greek language: , &quot;ethos&quot; meaning &quot;character&quot; and , &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;the study of&quot;. The term was first popularized by the American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1902.

== History ==

=== The beginnings of ethology ===

Ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and its understanding in terms of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose 1872 book &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé George Romanes, who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method, anecdotal cognitivism, that did not gain scientific support.

Other early ethologists, such as Eugène Marais, Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, Wallace Craig and Julian Huxley, instead concentrated on behaviours that can be called instinctive in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their starting point for studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an ethogram, a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence. This provided an objective, cumulative database of behaviour.

=== Growth of the field ===

Due to the work of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, ethology developed strongly in continental Europe during the years prior to World War II. After the war, Tinbergen moved to the University of Oxford, and ethology became stronger in the UK, with the additional influence of William Thorpe, Robert Hinde, and Patrick Bateson at the University of Cambridge.

Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for their work of developing ethology.

Ethology is now a well-recognized scientific discipline, with its own journals such as &quot;Animal Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Applied Animal Behaviour Science&quot;, &quot;Animal Cognition&quot;, &quot;Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Behavioral Ecology&quot; and &quot;Ethology&quot;. In 1972, the International Society for Human Ethology was founded along with its journal, &quot;Human Ethology&quot;.

=== Social ethology ===

In 1972, the English ethologist John H. Crook distinguished comparative ethology from social ethology, and argued that much of the ethology that had existed so far was really comparative ethology—examining animals as individuals—whereas, in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.

E. O. Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; appeared in 1975, and since that time, the study of behaviour has been much more concerned with social aspects. It has been driven by the Darwinism associated with Wilson, Robert Trivers, and W. D. Hamilton. The related development of behavioural ecology has helped transform ethology. Furthermore, a substantial rapprochement with comparative psychology has occurred, so the modern scientific study of behaviour offers a spectrum of approaches. In 2020, Tobias Starzak and Albert Newen from the Institute of Philosophy II at the Ruhr University Bochum postulated that animals may have beliefs.

== Determinants of behaviour ==

Behaviour is determined by three major factors, namely inborn instincts, learning, and environmental factors. The latter include abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors such as temperature or light conditions have dramatic effects on animals, especially if they are ectothermic or nocturnal. Biotic factors include members of the same species (e.g. sexual behavior), predators (fight or flight), or parasites and diseases.

=== Instinct ===

&quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defines instinct as &quot;A largely inheritable and unalterable tendency of an organism to make a complex and specific response to environmental stimuli without involving reason&quot;. This covers fixed action patterns like beak movements of bird chicks, and the waggle dance of honeybees.

==== Fixed action patterns ====

An important development, associated with the name of Konrad Lorenz though probably due more to his teacher, Oskar Heinroth, was the identification of fixed action patterns. Lorenz popularized these as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of identifiable stimuli called sign stimuli or &quot;releasing stimuli&quot;. Fixed action patterns are now considered to be instinctive behavioural sequences that are relatively invariant within the species and that almost inevitably run to completion.

One example of a releaser is the beak movements of many bird species performed by newly hatched chicks, which stimulates the mother to regurgitate food for her offspring. Other examples are the classic studies by Tinbergen on the egg-retrieval behaviour and the effects of a &quot;supernormal stimulus&quot; on the behaviour of graylag geese.

One investigation of this kind was the study of the waggle dance (&quot;dance language&quot;) in bee communication by Karl von Frisch.

=== Learning ===

==== Habituation ====

Habituation is a simple form of learning and occurs in many animal taxa. It is the process whereby an animal ceases responding to a stimulus. Often, the response is an innate behavior. Essentially, the animal learns not to respond to irrelevant stimuli. For example, prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;) give alarm calls when predators approach, causing all individuals in the group to quickly scramble down burrows. When prairie dog towns are located near trails used by humans, giving alarm calls every time a person walks by is expensive in terms of time and energy. Habituation to humans is therefore an important behavior in this context.

==== Associative learning ====


Associative learning in animal behaviour is any learning process in which a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. The first studies of associative learning were made by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who observed that dogs trained to associate food with the ringing of a bell would salivate on hearing the bell.

==== Imprinting ====


Imprinting enables the young to discriminate the members of their own species, vital for reproductive success. This important type of learning only takes place in a very limited period of time. Konrad Lorenz observed that the young of birds such as geese and chickens followed their mothers spontaneously from almost the first day after they were hatched, and he discovered that this response could be imitated by an arbitrary stimulus if the eggs were incubated artificially and the stimulus were presented during a critical period that continued for a few days after hatching.

==== Cultural learning ====

===== Observational learning =====

===== Imitation =====

Imitation is an advanced behavior whereby an animal observes and exactly replicates the behavior of another.
The National Institutes of Health reported that capuchin monkeys preferred the company of researchers who imitated them to that of researchers who did not. The monkeys not only spent more time with their imitators but also preferred to engage in a simple task with them even when provided with the option of performing the same task with a non-imitator. Imitation has been observed in recent research on chimpanzees; not only did these chimps copy the actions of another individual, when given a choice, the chimps preferred to imitate the actions of the higher-ranking elder chimpanzee as opposed to the lower-ranking young chimpanzee.

===== Stimulus and local enhancement =====

Animals can learn using observational learning but without the process of imitation. One way is &quot;stimulus enhancement&quot; in which individuals become interested in an object as the result of observing others interacting with the object. Increased interest in an object can result in object manipulation which allows for new object-related behaviours by trial-and-error learning. Haggerty (1909) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage, placed its arm into a wooden chute, and pulled a rope in the chute to release food. Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four occasions. The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial-and-error. In local enhancement, a demonstrator attracts an observer&#x27;s attention to a particular location. Local enhancement has been observed to transmit foraging information among birds, rats and pigs. The stingless bee (&quot;Trigona corvina&quot;) uses local enhancement to locate other members of their colony and food resources.

===== Social transmission =====

A well-documented example of social transmission of a behaviour occurred in a group of macaques on Hachijojima Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers started giving them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them. About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, putting it into the water with one hand, and cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young—a form of social transmission.

==== Teaching ====

Teaching is a highly specialized aspect of learning in which the &quot;teacher&quot; (demonstrator) adjusts their behaviour to increase the probability of the &quot;pupil&quot; (observer) achieving the desired end-result of the behaviour. For example, orcas are known to intentionally beach themselves to catch pinniped prey. Mother orcas teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack the prey. Because the mother orca is altering her behaviour to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching. Teaching is not limited to mammals. Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called &quot;tandem running,&quot; in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food. It has been suggested that the pupil ant is able to learn this route to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants. This behaviour of teaching is also exemplified by crows, specifically New Caledonian crows. The adults (whether individual or in families) teach their young adolescent offspring how to construct and utilize tools. For example, &quot;Pandanus&quot; branches are used to extract insects and other larvae from holes within trees.

== Mating and the fight for supremacy ==

Individual reproduction is the most important phase in the proliferation of individuals or genes within a species: for this reason, there exist complex mating rituals, which can be very complex even if they are often regarded as fixed action patterns. The stickleback&#x27;s complex mating ritual, studied by Tinbergen, is regarded as a notable example.

Often in social life, animals fight for the right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of fighting for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called pecking order among poultry. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Chickens higher in the pecking order may at times be distinguished by their healthier appearance when compared to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.

== Social behaviour ==

Several animal species, including humans, tend to live in groups. Group size is a major aspect of their social environment. Social life is probably a complex and effective survival strategy. It may be regarded as a sort of symbiosis among individuals of the same species: a society is composed of a group of individuals belonging to the same species living within well-defined rules on food management, role assignments and reciprocal dependence.

When biologists interested in evolution theory first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, such as how the birth of sterile castes, like in bees, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like squirrels, an individual would risk its own life to save the rest of the group. These behaviours may be examples of altruism. Not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful including chimpanzees, as well as anecdotal reports of vengeful camels.

Altruistic behaviour has been explained by the gene-centred view of evolution.

=== Benefits and costs of group living ===

One advantage of group living is decreased predation. If the number of predator attacks stays the same despite increasing prey group size, each prey has a reduced risk of predator attacks through the dilution effect. Further, according to the selfish herd theory, the fitness benefits associated with group living vary depending on the location of an individual within the group. The theory suggests that conspecifics positioned at the centre of a group will reduce the likelihood predations while those at the periphery will become more vulnerable to attack. In groups, prey can also actively reduce their predation risk through more effective defence tactics, or through earlier detection of predators through increased vigilance.

Another advantage of group living is an increased ability to forage for food. Group members may exchange information about food sources, facilitating the process of resource location. Honeybees are a notable example of this, using the waggle dance to communicate the location of flowers to the rest of their hive. Predators also receive benefits from hunting in groups, through using better strategies and being able to take down larger prey.

Some disadvantages accompany living in groups. Living in close proximity to other animals can facilitate the transmission of parasites and disease, and groups that are too large may also experience greater competition for resources and mates.

=== Group size ===

Theoretically, social animals should have optimal group sizes that maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of group living. However, in nature, most groups are stable at slightly larger than optimal sizes. Because it generally benefits an individual to join an optimally-sized group, despite slightly decreasing the advantage for all members, groups may continue to increase in size until it is more advantageous to remain alone than to join an overly full group.
==Tinbergen&#x27;s four questions for ethologists==

Tinbergen argued that ethology needed to include four kinds of explanation in any instance of behaviour:
* Function – How does the behaviour affect the animal&#x27;s chances of survival and reproduction? Why does the animal respond that way instead of some other way?
* Causation – What are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning?
* Development – How does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the animal to display the behaviour?
* Evolutionary history – How does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have begun through the process of phylogeny?

These explanations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive—all instances of behaviour require an explanation at each of these four levels. For example, the function of eating is to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of eating is hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism&#x27;s lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions—for example, to argue that people eat because they are hungry and not to acquire nutrients—without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.

<text>In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is the set of waves of an electromagnetic (EM) field, which propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy.

Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted &quot;c&quot;. The frequency of the wave&#x27;s oscillation determines its wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are on average perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave.

Electromagnetic radiation is commonly referred to as &quot;light&quot;, EM, EMR, or electromagnetic waves.

The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength. Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter. In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum includes: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.

Electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them. EM waves carry energy, momentum, and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (&quot;radiate&quot;) without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field, while the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.

In quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and proportional to frequency according to Planck&#x27;s equation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;hf&quot;, where &quot;E&quot; is the energy per photon, &quot;f&quot; is the frequency of the photon, and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. Thus, higher frequency photons have more energy. For example, a gamma ray photon has times the energy of a extremely low frequency radio wave photon.

The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation&#x27;s power and its frequency. EMR of lower energy ultraviolet or lower frequencies (i.e., near ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is &quot;non-ionizing&quot; because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules or to break chemical bonds. The effect of non-ionizing radiation on chemical systems and living tissue is primarily simply heating, through the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are &quot;ionizing&quot; – individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. Ionizing radiation can cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond simply heating, and can be a health hazard and dangerous.

=== Theory ===

==== Maxwell&#x27;s equations ====
James Clerk Maxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave. Maxwell&#x27;s equations were confirmed by Heinrich Hertz through experiments with radio waves.

==== Near and far fields ====
Maxwell&#x27;s equations established that some charges and currents (&quot;sources&quot;) produce local electromagnetic fields near them that do not radiate. Currents directly produce magnetic fields, but such fields of a magnetic-dipole–type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an electric-dipole–type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the &quot;near&quot; field. Neither of these behaviours is responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they only efficiently transfer energy to a receiver very close to the source, such as inside a transformer. The near field has strong effects its source, with any energy withdrawn by a receiver causing increased &quot;load&quot; (decreased electrical reactance) on the source. The near field does not propagate freely into space, carrying energy away without a distance limit, but rather oscillates, returning its energy to the transmitter if it is not absorbed by a receiver.

By contrast, the &quot;far&quot; field is composed of &quot;radiation&quot; that is free of the transmitter, in the sense that the transmitter requires the same power to send changes in the field out regardless of whether anything absorbs the signal, e.g. a radio station does not need to increase its power when more receivers use the signal. This far part of the electromagnetic field &quot;is&quot; electromagnetic radiation. The far fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Due to conservation of energy, the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same. Because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source, the power density of EM radiation from an isotropic source decreases with the inverse square of the distance from the source; this is called the inverse-square law. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field, the near field, which varies in intensity according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does &quot;not&quot; transport a conserved amount of energy over distances but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).

In the Liénard–Wiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell&#x27;s equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle&#x27;s uniform velocity are both associated with the near field, and do not comprise electromagnetic radiation.

=== Properties ===
Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For example, in optics two or more coherent light waves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual light waves.

The electromagnetic fields of light are not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However, in nonlinear media, such as some crystals, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields—these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.

In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell&#x27;s law. Light of composite wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not so difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of &quot;particulate&quot; behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature of &quot;matter&quot;. Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair.

Some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single photon. When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once.

A quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics.

Electromagnetic waves can be polarized, reflected, refracted, or diffracted, and can interfere with each other.

=== Wave model ===

 In homogeneous, isotropic media, electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave, meaning that its oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel. It comes from the following equations:formula_1These equations predicate that any electromagnetic wave must be a transverse wave, where the electric field and the magnetic field are both perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

The electric and magnetic parts of the field in an electromagnetic wave stand in a fixed ratio of strengths to satisfy the two Maxwell equations that specify how one is produced from the other. In dissipation-less (lossless) media, these E and B fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). In the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell curl operator equations, a time-change in one type of field is proportional to the curl of the other. These derivatives require that the E and B fields in EMR are in-phase (see mathematics section below).

An important aspect of light&#x27;s nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as dispersion.

A monochromatic wave (a wave of a single frequency) consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves longer than a continent to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:
: formula_2
where &quot;v&quot; is the speed of the wave (&quot;c&quot; in a vacuum or less in other media), &quot;f&quot; is the frequency and &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.

Electromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic wave equation. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source. Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation). As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of Fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum, or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be &quot;monochromatic&quot;. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation, and its polarization.

Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference. Additionally, multiple polarization signals can be combined (i.e. interfered) to form new states of polarization, which is known as parallel polarization state generation.

The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy.

=== Particle model and quantum theory ===
An anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as black bodies. Physicists struggled with this problem unsuccessfully for many years, and it later became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. In 1900, Max Planck developed a new theory of black-body radiation that explained the observed spectrum. Planck&#x27;s theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or packets of energy. These packets were called quanta. In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the particle of light was given the name photon, to correspond with other particles being described around this time, such as the electron and proton. A photon has an energy, &quot;E&quot;, proportional to its frequency, &quot;f&quot;, by
: formula_3
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, formula_4 is the wavelength and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. This is sometimes known as the Planck–Einstein equation. In quantum theory (see first quantization) the energy of the photons is thus directly proportional to the frequency of the EMR wave.

Likewise, the momentum &quot;p&quot; of a photon is also proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength:
: formula_5

The source of Einstein&#x27;s proposal that light was composed of particles (or could act as particles in some circumstances) was an experimental anomaly not explained by the wave theory: the photoelectric effect, in which light striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface, causing an electric current to flow across an applied voltage. Experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the &quot;frequency&quot;, rather than the &quot;intensity&quot;, of the light. Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein&#x27;s ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein&#x27;s explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed, such as the Compton effect.

As a photon is absorbed by an atom, it excites the atom, elevating an electron to a higher energy level (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called fluorescence, a type of photoluminescence. An example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet (blacklight). Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light. Delayed emission is called phosphorescence.

=== Wave–particle duality ===
The modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the notion of wave–particle duality.

=== Wave and particle effects of electromagnetic radiation ===
Together, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. Dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the radiation scattered out of the light beam. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star&#x27;s atmosphere. A similar phenomenon occurs for emission, which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation. An example is the emission spectrum of nebulae. Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature.

These phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases (emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what chemical elements comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the red shift.

=== Propagation speed ===
In empty space (vacuum), electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, formula_6 , 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 186,000 miles per second). 

In a medium other than vacuum it travels at a lower velocity formula_7, given by a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 characteristic of the medium called the velocity factor formula_8 or its reciprocal, the refractive index formula_9: 
:formula_10
The reason for this is that in matter the electric and magnetic fields of the wave are slowed because they polarize the charged particles in the medium they pass through. The oscillating electric field causes nearby positive and negative charges in atoms to move slightly apart and together, inducing an oscillating polarization, creating an electric polarization field. The oscillating magnetic field moves nearby magnetic dipoles, inducing an oscillating magnetization, creating an induced oscillating magnetic field. These induced fields, superposed on the original wave fields, slow the wave (see Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem). The amount of slowing depends on the electromagnetic properties of the medium, the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. In the SI system of units, empty space has a vacuum permittivity of formula_11 8.854×10−12 F/m (farads per metre) and a vacuum permeability of formula_12 1.257×10−6 H/m (henries per meter). These universal constants determine the speed of light
:formula_13
In a medium that is isotropic and linear, which means the electric polarization is proportional to the electric field formula_14 and the magnetization is proportional to the magnetic field formula_15, the speed of the waves, the formula_8 and refractive index, is determined by only two parameters: the electric permittivity formula_17 of the medium in farads per meter, and the magnetic permeability of the medium formula_18 in henrys per meter
:formula_19
:formula_20
If the permittivity and permeability of the medium is constant for different frequency EM waves, this is called a &quot;non-dispersive&quot; medium. In this case all EM wave frequencies would travel at the same velocity, and the waveshape stays constant as it travels. However in real matter formula_17 and formula_18 typically vary with frequency, this is called a &quot;dispersive&quot; medium. In dispersive media different spectral bands have different propagation characteristics, and an arbitrary wave changes shape as it travels though the medium.

== History of discovery ==
Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a glass prism to refract light from the Sun and detected invisible rays that caused heating beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded with a thermometer. These &quot;calorific rays&quot; were later termed infrared.

In 1801, German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet in an experiment similar to Herschel&#x27;s, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter&#x27;s experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called &quot;chemical rays&quot;) were capable of causing chemical reactions.
In 1862–64 James Clerk Maxwell developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation) in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light, following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves, and produced and characterized what were later termed radio waves and microwaves.

Wilhelm Röntgen discovered and named X-rays. After experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered X-rays&#x27; main properties.

The last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with radioactivity. Henri Becquerel found that uranium salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to X-rays, and Marie Curie discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of radium. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays (alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays. In 1910 British physicist William Henry Bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914 Rutherford and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths, finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency, although a &#x27;cross-over&#x27; between X and gamma rays makes it possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength) than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them, gamma rays tend to be natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence man-made) unless they are as a result of bremsstrahlung X-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles) colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.

== Electromagnetic spectrum ==


EM radiation (the designation &#x27;radiation&#x27; excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields) is classified by wavelength into radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by Fourier analysis in terms of sinusoidal waves (monochromatic radiation), which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the EMR spectrum.

For certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as &quot;random&quot;, and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their &quot;power&quot; content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the power spectral density of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the Zero point wave field of the electromagnetic vacuum.

The behavior of EM radiation and its interaction with matter depends on its frequency, and changes qualitatively as the frequency changes. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the spectrum, although photons with energies near the Planck energy or exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new physical theories to describe.

=== Radio and microwave ===

When radio waves impinge upon a conductor, they couple to the conductor, travel along it and induce an electric current on the conductor surface by moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of charge.

Electromagnetic radiation phenomena with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter are called microwaves; with frequencies between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz.

At radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms. In electrical conductors, such induced bulk movement of charges (electric currents) results in absorption of the EMR, or else separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a microwave oven. These interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both.

=== Infrared ===

Like radio and microwave, infrared (IR) is reflected by metals (and also most EMR, well into the ultraviolet range). However, unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation, Infrared EMR commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. It is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as heat. The same process, run in reverse, causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see thermal radiation section below).

Infrared radiation is divided into spectral subregions. While different subdivision schemes exist, the spectrum is commonly divided as near-infrared (0.75–1.4 μm), short-wavelength infrared (1.4–3 μm), mid-wavelength infrared (3–8 μm), long-wavelength infrared (8–15 μm) and far infrared (15–1000 μm).

=== Visible light ===

Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum. EM radiation with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light.

As frequency increases into the visible range, photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not a coincidence that this happens in the visible range, as the mechanism of vision involves the change in bonding of a single molecule, retinal, which absorbs a single photon. The change in retinal causes a change in the shape of the rhodopsin protein it is contained in, which starts the biochemical process that causes the retina of the human eye to sense the light.

Photosynthesis becomes possible in this range as well, for the same reason. A single molecule of chlorophyll is excited by a single photon. In plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis, carotenoids act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called non-photochemical quenching, to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels.

Animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons.

Infrared, microwaves and radio waves are known to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation.

Visible light is able to affect only a tiny percentage of all molecules. Usually not in a permanent or damaging way, rather the photon excites an electron which then emits another photon when returning to its original position. This is the source of color produced by most dyes. Retinal is an exception. When a photon is absorbed, the retinal permanently changes structure from cis to trans, and requires a protein to convert it back, i.e. reset it to be able to function as a light detector again.

Limited evidence indicate that some reactive oxygen species are created by visible light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same manner as ultraviolet A.

=== Ultraviolet ===

As frequency increases into the ultraviolet, photons now carry enough energy (about three electron volts or more) to excite certain doubly bonded molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement. In DNA, this causes lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is capable of causing cancer, and (for UVB) skin burns (sunburn) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase) effects.

At the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom, in a process called photoionisation. The energy required for this is always larger than about 10 electron volt (eV) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124 nm (some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of 33 eV, which is the energy required to ionize water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range, is sometimes called &quot;extreme UV&quot;. Ionizing UV is strongly filtered by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

=== X-rays and gamma rays ===

Electromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths), is therefore termed ionizing radiation. (Many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all X-rays and gamma rays qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum, penetrate matter.

== Atmosphere and magnetosphere ==
Most UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular nitrogen, and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation of dioxygen and finally ozone at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well transmitted.

Visible light is well transmitted in air, a property known as an atmospheric window, as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor and CO2.

Absorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves.

Finally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 m or so (about 30 MHz), the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in certain layers of the ionosphere begins to interact with radio waves (see skywave). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 m or 3 MHz) to be reflected and results in shortwave radio beyond line-of-sight. However, certain ionospheric effects begin to block incoming radiowaves from space, when their frequency is less than about 10 MHz (wavelength longer than about 30 m).

== Thermal and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat ==

The basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together. When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to thermal equilibrium and manifesting itself as thermal energy, or even kinetic energy, in the material. With a few exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as fluorescence, harmonic generation, photochemical reactions, the photovoltaic effect for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared lasers, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can easily set paper afire.

Ionizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny fraction of a second. This process makes ionizing radiation far more dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation. This caveat also applies to UV, even though almost all of it is not ionizing, because UV can damage molecules due to electronic excitation, which is far greater per unit energy than heating effects.

Infrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a black body is usually considered a form of heat, since it has an equivalent temperature and is associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy. However, &quot;heat&quot; is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often confused with thermal energy. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter. Thus, &quot;any&quot; electromagnetic radiation can &quot;heat&quot; (in the sense of increase the thermal energy temperature of) a material, when it is absorbed.

The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material.

The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum radiation entropy.

== Biological effects ==

Bioelectromagnetics is the study of the interactions and effects of EM radiation on living organisms. The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those in humans, depends upon the radiation&#x27;s power and frequency. For low-frequency radiation (radio waves to near ultraviolet) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone, acting through heating when radiation is absorbed. For these thermal effects, frequency is important as it affects the intensity of the radiation and penetration into the organism (for example, microwaves penetrate better than infrared). It is widely accepted that low frequency fields that are too weak to cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect.

Some research suggests that weaker &quot;non-thermal&quot; electromagnetic fields (including weak ELF magnetic fields, although the latter does not strictly qualify as EM radiation) and modulated RF and microwave fields can have biological effects, though the significance of this is unclear.

The World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic. This group contains possible carcinogens such as lead, DDT, and styrene.

At higher frequencies (some of visible and beyond), the effects of individual photons begin to become important, as these now have enough energy individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules. All UV frequencies have been classed as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer.

Thus, at UV frequencies and higher, electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological systems than simple heating predicts. This is most obvious in the &quot;far&quot; (or &quot;extreme&quot;) ultraviolet. UV, with X-ray and gamma radiation, are referred to as ionizing radiation due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials (including living tissue). Since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce little heating, it is considered far more dangerous (in terms of damage-produced per unit of energy, or power) than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Use as a weapon ===

The heat ray is an application of EMR that makes use of microwave frequencies to create an unpleasant heating effect in the upper layer of the skin. A publicly known heat ray weapon called the Active Denial System was developed by the US military as an experimental weapon to deny the enemy access to an area. A death ray is a theoretical weapon that delivers heat ray based on electromagnetic energy at levels that are capable of injuring human tissue. An inventor of a death ray, Harry Grindell Matthews, claimed to have lost sight in his left eye while working on his death ray weapon based on a microwave magnetron from the 1920s (a normal microwave oven creates a tissue damaging cooking effect inside the oven at around 2 kV/m).

== Derivation from electromagnetic theory ==
Electromagnetic waves are predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations. There are nontrivial solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell&#x27;s equations (without charges or currents), describing &quot;waves&quot; of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell&#x27;s equations in free space:

{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where
* formula_23 and formula_24 are the electric field (measured in V/m or N/C) and the magnetic field (measured in T or Wb/m2), respectively;
* formula_25 yields the divergence and formula_26 the curl of a vector field formula_27
* formula_28 and formula_29 are partial derivatives (rate of change in time, with location fixed) of the magnetic and electric field;
* formula_30 is the permeability of a vacuum (4 × 10−7 H/m), and formula_31 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F/m);

Besides the trivial solution
formula_32
useful solutions can be derived with the following vector identity, valid for all vectors formula_33 in some vector field:
formula_34

Taking the curl of the second Maxwell equation () yields:
{\partial t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Evaluating the left hand side of () with the above identity and simplifying using (), yields:
Evaluating the right hand side of () by exchanging the sequence of derivatives and inserting the fourth yields:
{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right) = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Combining () and () again, gives a vector-valued differential equation for the electric field, solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations:

{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the curl of the fourth Maxwell equation () results in a similar differential equation for a magnetic field solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations:

{\partial t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Both differential equations have the form of the general wave equation for waves propagating with speed formula_35 where formula_36 is a function of time and location, which gives the amplitude of the wave at some time at a certain location:
formula_37 is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and formula_38 is a position vector. formula_39 is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words,
formula_40
for a generic wave traveling in the formula_41 direction.

From the first of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, we get
formula_42

Thus,
formula_43
which implies that the electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates. The second of Maxwell&#x27;s equations yields the magnetic field, namely,
formula_44

Thus,
formula_45

The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of formula_46.

The electric and magnetic field waves in the far-field travel at the speed of light. They have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, formula_47, which can be seen immediately from the Poynting vector. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as formula_48. Also, E and B far-fields in free space, which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time, and the curl operator on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first-order in time, resulting in the same phase shift for both fields in each mathematical operation.

From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is described as photon polarization. The direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field.

More general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. Many competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric field equation, which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation.

<text>Ernest Miller Hemingway ( ; July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer and journalist. Known for an economical, understated style that influenced later 20th-century writers, he has been romanticized for his adventurous lifestyle and outspoken, blunt public image. Some of his seven novels, six short-story collections and two non-fiction works have become classics of American literature, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. After high school, he spent six months as a reporter for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; before enlisting in the Red Cross. He served as an ambulance driver on the Italian Front in World War I and was seriously wounded by shrapnel in 1918. In 1921, Hemingway moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and was influenced by the modernist writers and artists of the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; expatriate community. His debut novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, was published in 1926. In 1928, Hemingway returned to the U.S., where he settled in Key West, Florida. His experiences during the war supplied material for his 1929 novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. 

In 1937, Hemingway went to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War, which formed the basis for his 1940 novel &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, written in Havana, Cuba. During World War II, Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris. In 1952, his novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was published to considerable acclaim, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. On a 1954 trip to Africa, Hemingway was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes, leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. He died by suicide at his house in Ketchum, Idaho, in 1961.

==Early life==

Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, a conservative community about which resident Frank Lloyd Wright said, &quot;So many churches for so many good people to go to.&quot; When Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they lived with Grace&#x27;s father, Ernest Miller Hall, after whom they named their first son, the second of their six children. 

His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, and his younger siblings included Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and Leicester in 1915. Grace followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children&#x27;s clothing by gender. With only a year separating the two, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one another strongly. Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest&#x27;s first three years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in similarly frilly feminine clothing.
Grace Hemingway was a well-known local musician, and taught her reluctant son to play the cello. Later he said music lessons contributed to his writing style, as evidenced in the &quot;contrapuntal structure&quot; of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. As an adult Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although they shared similar enthusiastic energies. His father taught him woodcraft during the family&#x27;s summer sojourns at Windemere on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan, where Ernest learned to hunt, fish and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan. These early experiences instilled in him a life-long passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.

Hemingway went to Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park between 1913 and 1917, where he competed in boxing, track and field, water polo, and football. He performed in the school orchestra for two years with his sister Marcelline, and received good grades in English classes. During his last two years at high school he edited the school&#x27;s newspaper and yearbook (the &quot;Trapeze&quot; and &quot;Tabula&quot;); he imitated the language of popular sportswriters and contributed under the pen name Ring Lardner Jr.—a nod to Ring Lardner of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; whose byline was &quot;Line O&#x27;Type&quot;. A remembrance garden in honor of Hemingway was erected in front of the high school in 1996.

After leaving high school, he went to work for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; as a cub reporter. Although he stayed there only for six months, the &quot;Star&quot;″s style guide, which stated &quot;Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative&quot;, became a foundation for his prose.

==World War I==

Hemingway wanted to go to war and tried to enlist in the U.S. Army but was not accepted because he had poor eyesight. Instead he volunteered to a Red Cross recruitment effort in December 1917 and signed on to be an ambulance driver with the American Red Cross Motor Corps in Italy. In May 1918, he sailed from New York, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery. That June he arrived at the Italian Front, holding the ranks of second lieutenant (A.R.C.) and &quot;sottotenente&quot; (Italian Army) simultaneously. On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his 1932 non-fiction book &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;: &quot;I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments.&quot; A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave.

On July 8, right after bringing chocolate and cigarettes from the canteen to the men at the front line, the group came under mortar fire. Hemingway was seriously wounded. Despite his wounds, he assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he was decorated with the Italian War Merit Cross (&quot;Croce al Merito di Guerra&quot;) and with the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor (&quot;Medaglia d&#x27;argento al valor militare&quot;). For his deed, he was promoted to first lieutenant (A.R.C.) and &quot;tenente&quot; (Italian Army). 

He was only 18 at the time. Hemingway later said of the incident: &quot;When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you ... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you.&quot; He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital, before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan. He spent six months at the hospital, where he met &quot;Chink&quot; Dorman-Smith. The two formed a strong friendship that lasted for decades.
While recuperating, Hemingway fell in love with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior. When Hemingway returned to the United States in January 1919, he believed Agnes would join him within months, and the two would marry. Instead, he received a letter from her in March with news that she was engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes Agnes&#x27;s rejection devastated and scarred the young man. In future relationships Hemingway followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him. 

His return home in 1919 was a difficult time of readjustment. Before the age of 20, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and with the need for recuperation. As biographer Michael S. Reynolds explains, &quot;Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee.&quot; He was not able to tell them how scared he had been &quot;in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not.&quot;

That September, he went on a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;, in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after coming home from war. A family friend offered Hemingway a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year, he began as a freelancer and staff writer for the &quot;Toronto Star Weekly&quot;. He returned to Michigan the next June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. In Chicago, he worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal &quot;Cooperative Commonwealth&quot;, where he met novelist Sherwood Anderson.

He met Hadley Richardson through his roommate&#x27;s sister. Later, he claimed, &quot;I knew she was the girl I was going to marry.&quot; Red-haired, with a &quot;nurturing instinct&quot;, Hadley was eight years older than Hemingway. Despite the age difference, she seemed less mature than usual for a woman her age, probably because of her overprotective mother. Bernice Kert, author of &quot;The Hemingway Women&quot;, claims Hadley was &quot;evocative&quot; of Agnes, but Agnes lacked Hadley&#x27;s childishness. After exchanging letters for a few months, Hemingway and Hadley decided to marry and travel to Europe. 

They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to go to Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the young couple. They were married on September 3, 1921. Two months later, Hemingway signed on as a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway&#x27;s marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: &quot;With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe.&quot;

==Paris==
Anderson suggested Paris because it was inexpensive and it was where &quot;the most interesting people in the world&quot; resided. There Hemingway would meet writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Ezra Pound who &quot;could help a young writer up the rungs of a career&quot;. 
Hemingway was a &quot;tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.&quot; He lived with Hadley in a small walk-up at 74 in the Latin Quarter, and rented a room nearby for work. Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, became Hemingway&#x27;s mentor and godmother to his son Jack; she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the &quot;Lost Generation&quot;—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. A regular at Stein&#x27;s salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Juan Gris, and Luis Quintanilla. He eventually withdrew from Stein&#x27;s influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.

Pound was older than Hemingway by 14 years when they met by chance in 1922 at Sylvia Beach&#x27;s bookstore Shakespeare and Company. They visited Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924. The two forged a strong friendship; in Hemingway Pound recognized and fostered a young talent. Pound—who had just finished editing T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;—introduced Hemingway to the Irish writer James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on &quot;alcoholic sprees&quot;.

During his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper. He covered the Greco-Turkish War, where he witnessed the burning of Smyrna, and wrote travel pieces such as &quot;Tuna Fishing in Spain&quot; and &quot;Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany&quot;. Almost all his fiction and short stories were lost, when in December 1922 as she was traveling to join him in Geneva, Hadley lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the train station Gare de Lyon. He was devastated and furious. Nine months later the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway&#x27;s first book, &quot;Three Stories and Ten Poems&quot;, was published in Paris. All that remained after the loss of the suitcase were two of the stories the volume contained; he wrote the third story early in 1923 while in Italy. A few months later, &quot;in our time&quot; (without capitals) was produced in Paris. The small volume included 18 vignettes, a dozen of which he wrote the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the corrida. He considered Toronto boring, missed Paris, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.

Hemingway, Hadley, and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January 1924 and moved into an apartment on the rue Notre-Dame des Champs. Hemingway helped Ford Madox Ford edit &quot;The Transatlantic Review&quot;, which published works by Pound, John Dos Passos, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and Stein, as well as some of Hemingway&#x27;s own early stories such as &quot;Indian Camp&quot;. When Hemingway&#x27;s first collection of stories, &quot;In Our Time&quot;, was published in 1925, the dust jacket bore comments from Ford. &quot;Indian Camp&quot; received considerable praise; Ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer, and critics in the United States praised Hemingway for reinvigorating the short-story genre with his crisp style and use of declarative sentences. Six months earlier, Hemingway had met F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the pair formed a friendship of &quot;admiration and hostility&quot;. Fitzgerald had published &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; the same year: Hemingway read it, liked it, and decided his next work had to be a novel.

The year before, Hemingway visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, for the first time, where he became fascinated by bullfighting. The Hemingways returned to Pamplona again in 1924 and a third time in June 1925; that year, they brought with them a group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway&#x27;s Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb.

A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (July 21), he began to write the draft of what would become &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, finishing eight weeks later. A few months later, in December 1925, the Hemingways left to spend the winter in Schruns, Austria, where Hemingway began extensively revising the manuscript. Pauline Pfeiffer, the daughter of a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas, who came to Paris to work for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, joined them in January. Against Hadley&#x27;s advice, Pfeiffer urged Hemingway to sign a contract with Scribner&#x27;s. He left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers and, on his return, began an affair with Pfeiffer during a stop in Paris, before returning to Schruns to finish the revisions in March. The manuscript arrived in New York in April; he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926, and Scribner&#x27;s published the novel in October.

&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; epitomized the post-war expatriate generation, received good reviews and is &quot;recognized as Hemingway&#x27;s greatest work&quot;. Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the &quot;point of the book&quot; was not so much about a generation being lost, but that &quot;the earth abideth forever&quot;; he believed the characters in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; may have been &quot;battered&quot; but were not lost.

Hemingway&#x27;s marriage to Hadley deteriorated as he was working on &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July. On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway&#x27;s offer of the proceeds from &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. They were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.
Before his marriage to Pfeiffer, Hemingway converted to Catholicism. They honeymooned in Le Grau-du-Roi, where he contracted anthrax, and he planned his next collection of short stories, &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, which was published in October 1927, and included his boxing story &quot;Fifty Grand&quot;. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long praised &quot;Fifty Grand&quot;, calling it, &quot;one of the best short stories that ever came to my hands ... the best prize-fight story I ever read ... a remarkable piece of realism.&quot;

By the end of the year Pauline was pregnant and wanted to move back to America. Dos Passos recommended Key West, and they left Paris in March 1928. Hemingway suffered a severe head injury in their Paris bathroom when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar, he was reluctant to answer. After his departure from Paris, Hemingway &quot;never again lived in a big city&quot;.

== Key West ==

Hemingway and Pauline went to Kansas City, Missouri, where their son Patrick was born on June 28, 1928, at Bell Memorial Hospital. Pauline had a difficult delivery; Hemingway wrote a fictionalized version of the event in &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. After Patrick&#x27;s birth, they traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York. On December 6, Hemingway was in New York visiting Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received the news that his father Clarence had killed himself. Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide. He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father&#x27;s suicide in 1903, and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll probably go the same way.&quot;

Upon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; before leaving for France in January. He had finished it the previous August but delayed the revision. The serialization in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; was scheduled to appear in May. In April, he was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times. The completed novel was published on September 27, 1929. Biographer James Mellow believes &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; established Hemingway&#x27;s stature as a major American writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. In Spain in mid-1929, Hemingway researched his next work, &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;. He wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bullfighting, explaining the toreros and corridas complete with glossaries and appendices, because he believed bullfighting was &quot;of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death.&quot;

During the early 1930s, Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, where he found &quot;the most beautiful country he had seen in the American West&quot; and hunted deer, elk, and grizzly bear. He was joined there by Dos Passos. In November 1930, after taking Dos Passos to the train station in Billings, Montana, Hemingway broke his arm in a car accident. He was hospitalized for seven weeks, with Pauline tending to him. The nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal, during which time he suffered intense pain.

His third child, Gloria Hemingway, was born a year later on November 12, 1931, in Kansas City as &quot;Gregory Hancock Hemingway&quot;. Pauline&#x27;s uncle bought the couple a house in Key West with a carriage house, the second floor of which was converted into a writing studio. He invited friends—including Waldo Peirce, Dos Passos, and Max Perkins—to join him on fishing trips and on an all-male expedition to the Dry Tortugas. He continued to travel to Europe and to Cuba, and—although in 1933 he wrote of Key West, &quot;We have a fine house here, and kids are all well&quot;—Mellow believes he &quot;was plainly restless&quot;.

In 1933, Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to Kenya. The 10-week trip provided material for &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;, as well as for the short stories &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; and &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;. The couple visited Mombasa, Nairobi, and Machakos in Kenya; then moved on to Tanganyika Territory, where they hunted in the Serengeti, around Lake Manyara, and west and southeast of present-day Tarangire National Park. Their guide was the noted &quot;white hunter&quot; Philip Percival who had guided Theodore Roosevelt on his 1909 safari. During these travels, Hemingway contracted amoebic dysentery that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;. On Hemingway&#x27;s return to Key West in early 1934, he began work on &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;, which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews.

He purchased a boat in 1934, naming it the &quot;Pilar&quot;, and began to sail the Caribbean. He arrived at Bimini in 1935, where he spent a considerable amount of time. During this period he worked on &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, published in 1937 while he was in Spain, which became the only novel he wrote during the 1930s.

== Spanish Civil War ==

Hemingway had been following developments in Spain since early in his career and from 1931 it became clear that there would be another European war. Hemingway predicted war would happen in the late 1930s. Baker writes that Hemingway did not expect Spain to &quot;become a sort of international testing-ground for Germany, Italy, and Russia before the Spanish Civil War was over&quot;. Despite Pauline&#x27;s reluctance, he signed with North American Newspaper Alliance to cover the Spanish Civil War, and sailed from New York on February 27, 1937. Journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn accompanied Hemingway. He had met her in Key West a year earlier. Like Hadley, Martha was a St. Louis native and, like Pauline, had worked for &quot;Vogue&quot; in Paris. According to Kert, Martha &quot;never catered to him the way other women did&quot;.

He arrived in Spain in March with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens. Ivens, who was filming &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot;, intended to replace John Dos Passos with Hemingway as screenwriter. Dos Passos had left the project when his friend and Spanish translator José Robles was arrested and later executed. The incident changed Dos Passos&#x27;s opinion of the leftist republicans, and caused a rift with Hemingway. Back in the U.S. that summer, Hemingway prepared the soundtrack for the film. It was screened at the White House in July.

In late August he returned to France and flew from Paris to Barcelona and then to Valencia. In September he visited the front in Belchite and then on to Teruel. On his return to Madrid Hemingway wrote his only play, &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;, as the city was being bombarded by the Francoist army. He went back to Key West for a few months in January 1938. It was a frustrating time: he found it hard to write, fretted over poor reviews for &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, bickered with Pauline, followed the news from Spain avidly and planned the next trip. He took two trips to Spain in 1938. In November he visited the location of the Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, along with other British and American journalists. They arrived to find the last bridge destroyed and had to retreat across the turbulent Ebro in a rowboat, Hemingway at the oars, &quot;pulling for dear life&quot;.
In early 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which began when Hemingway met Martha Gellhorn. Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they rented &quot;Finca Vigía&quot; (&quot;Lookout Farm&quot;), a property from Havana. That summer while visiting with Pauline and the children in Wyoming, she took the children and left him. When his divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married on November 20, 1940, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

Hemingway followed the pattern established after his divorce from Hadley and moved again. He split his time between Cuba and the newly established resort Sun Valley. He was at work on &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, which he began in March 1939 and finished in July 1940. His pattern was to move around while working on a manuscript, and he wrote &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; in Cuba, Wyoming, and Sun Valley. Published that October, it became a book-of-the-month choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and as Meyers describes, &quot;triumphantly re-established Hemingway&#x27;s literary reputation&quot;.
In January 1941, Martha was sent to China on assignment for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine. Hemingway went with her, sending in dispatches for the newspaper &quot;PM&quot;. Meyers writes that Hemingway had little enthusiasm for the trip or for China, Although his dispatches for &quot;PM&quot; provided incisive insights of the Sino-Japanese War according to Reynolds, with analysis of Japanese incursions into the Philippines sparking an &quot;American war in the Pacific&quot;. In August, Hemingway returned to &quot;Finca Vigía&quot;. In September, he left for Sun Valley.

== World War II ==
The United States entered the war after the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Back in Cuba, Hemingway refitted the &quot;Pilar&quot; as a Q-boat and went on patrol for German U-boats. He also created a counterintelligence unit headquartered in his guesthouse to surveil Falangists, and Nazi sympathizers. Martha and his friends thought his activities &quot;little more than a diverting racket&quot;, but the FBI began watching him and compiled a 124-page file. Martha wanted Hemingway in Europe as a journalist and failed to understand his reticence to take part in another European war. They fought frequently and bitterly, and he drank too much, until she left for Europe to report for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in September 1943. On a visit to Cuba in March 1944, Hemingway was bullying and abusive with Martha. Reynolds writes that &quot;looking backward from 1960–61 [anyone] might say that his behavior was a manifestation of the depression that eventually destroyed him&quot;. A few weeks later, he contacted &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; who made him their front-line correspondent. He was in Europe from May 1944 to March 1945.

When he arrived in London, he met &quot;Time&quot; magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated. Martha had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because Hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane, and she arrived in London to find him hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. She was unsympathetic to his plight; she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was &quot;through, absolutely finished&quot;. The last time that Hemingway saw Martha was in March 1945 as he prepared to return to Cuba; their divorce was finalized later that year. Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.

Hemingway sustained a severe head-wound that required 57 stitches. Still suffering symptoms of the concussion, he accompanied troops to the Normandy landings wearing a large head bandage. The military treated him as &quot;precious cargo&quot; and he was not allowed ashore. The landing craft he was on came within sight of Omaha Beach before coming under enemy fire when it turned back. Hemingway later wrote in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; that he could see &quot;the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [landing troops] lay where they had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover&quot;. Mellow explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the &quot;Dorothea Dix&quot;. Late in July, he attached himself to &quot;the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles &#x27;Buck&#x27; Lanham, as it drove toward Paris&quot;, and Hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in Rambouillet outside of Paris. Paul Fussell remarks: &quot;Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if he does it well.&quot; This was, in fact, in contravention of the Geneva Convention, and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said that he &quot;beat the rap&quot; by claiming that he only offered advice.

He was present at the liberation of Paris on August 25; however contrary to legend, he was not the first into the city nor did he liberate the Ritz. While there, he visited Sylvia Beach and met Picasso with Mary Welsh, and in a spirit of happiness, forgave Gertrude Stein. Later that year, he observed heavy fighting at the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, he traveled to Luxembourg, in spite of illness, to report on The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham referred him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; he recovered a week later, but most of the fighting was over. He was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery in 1947, in recognition for having been &quot;under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions&quot;.

== Cuba and the Nobel Prize ==

Hemingway said he &quot;was out of business as a writer&quot; from 1942 to 1945. In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later. The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, he injured his knee and sustained another head wound. A few years later Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents. A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound, severely ill and delirious. The doctor in Cuba diagnosed schizophrenia, and sent him for 18 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy.

Hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die: in 1939 William Butler Yeats and Ford Madox Ford; in 1940 F. Scott Fitzgerald; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year in 1947, Max Perkins, Hemingway&#x27;s long-time Scribner&#x27;s editor, and friend. During this period, he suffered from severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes—much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking. 

In January 1946, he began work on &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot;, finishing 800 pages by June. During the post-war years, he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled &quot;The Land&quot;, &quot;The Sea&quot; and &quot;The Air&quot;, which he wanted to combine in one novel titled &quot;The Sea Book&quot;. Both projects stalled. Mellow writes that Hemingway&#x27;s inability to write was &quot;a symptom of his troubles&quot; during these years.

In 1948, Hemingway and Mary traveled to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway fell in love with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel &quot;Across the River and into the Trees&quot;, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot;, Hemingway wrote the draft of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in eight weeks, saying that it was &quot;the best I can write ever for all of my life&quot;. Published in September 1952, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1953. In June, he departed Cuba for his second trip to Africa.
In January 1954 while in Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in successive plane crashes. He had chartered a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and was forced into a crash landing. Hemingway sustained injuries to his back and shoulder. Mary sustained broken ribs and went into shock. After a night in the brush, they chartered a boat on the river and arrived in Butiaba, where they were met by a pilot who had been searching for them. He assured them he could fly out, but the landing strip was too rough and the plane exploded in flames. Mary and the pilot escaped through a broken window. Hemingway had to smash his way out by battering the door open with his head. 

Hemingway suffered burns and another serious head injury, that caused cerebral fluid to leak from the injury. They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway&#x27;s death. He briefed the reporters and spent the next few weeks recuperating in Nairobi. Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second-degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. 

Months later in Venice, Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway&#x27;s injuries: two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull. The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been &quot;a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries.&quot;

In October 1954, Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He modestly told the press that Carl Sandburg, Isak Dinesen and Bernard Berenson deserved the prize, but he gladly accepted the prize money. Mellow says Hemingway &quot;had coveted the Nobel Prize&quot;, but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and their worldwide press coverage, &quot;there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway&#x27;s mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy&#x27;s decision.&quot; He was still recuperating and decided against traveling to Stockholm. Instead he sent a speech to be read in which he defined the writer&#x27;s life:

Since his return from Africa, Hemingway had been slowly writing his &quot;African Journal&quot;. Late in 1955 and early into 1956 he was bedridden with a variety of illnesses. He was ordered to stop drinking so as to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but eventually disregarded. In October 1956, he returned to Europe and visited ailing Basque writer Pio Baroja, who died a few weeks later. During the trip, Hemingway again became sick and was treated for a variety of ailments including liver disease and high blood pressure.
In November 1956, while staying in Paris, he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when he returned to Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;. In 1959, he ended a period of intense activity: he finished &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; (scheduled to be released the following year); brought &quot;True at First Light&quot; to 200,000 words; added chapters to &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot;; and worked on &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana as he focused on the finishing touches for &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;. Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.

&quot;Finca Vigía&quot; became crowded with guests and tourists, as Hemingway considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959, he bought a home overlooking the Big Wood River, outside Ketchum and left Cuba—although he apparently remained on easy terms with the Castro government, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; he was &quot;delighted&quot; with Castro&#x27;s overthrow of Batista. He was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and in 1960, for his 61st birthday.

In 1960, he and Mary decided to leave, after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals. On July 25, 1960, the Hemingways left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana. After the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, &quot;Finca Vigía&quot; was expropriated by the Cuban government, complete with Hemingway&#x27;s collection of about 5,000 books.

== Idaho and suicide ==

After leaving Cuba, in Sun Valley, Hemingway continued to rework the material that was published as &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; through the 1950s. In mid-1959, he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by &quot;Life&quot; magazine. &quot;Life&quot; wanted only 10,000 words, but the manuscript grew out of control. For the first time in his life he could not organize his writing, so he asked A. E. Hotchner to travel to Cuba to help him. Hotchner helped trim the &quot;Life&quot; piece down to 40,000 words, and Scribner&#x27;s agreed to a full-length book version (&quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot;) of almost 130,000 words. 

Hotchner found Hemingway to be &quot;unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused&quot;, and suffering badly from failing eyesight. He left Cuba for the last time on July 25, 1960. Mary went with him to New York where he set up a small office and attempted unsuccessfully to work. Soon after, he left New York, traveling without Mary to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. A few days later the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, &quot;Reports false. Enroute Madrid. Love Papa.&quot; 

He was, in fact, seriously ill, and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown. Feeling lonely, he took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having the first installments of &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot; published in &quot;Life&quot; that September to good reviews. In October, he went back to New York, where he refused to leave Mary&#x27;s apartment, presuming that he was being watched. She quickly took him to Idaho, where they were met at the train station in Ketchum by local physician George Saviers.

He was concerned about finances, missed Cuba, his books, and his life there, and fretted that he would never return to retrieve the manuscripts that he had left in a bank vault. He believed the manuscripts that would be published as &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; and &quot;True at First Light&quot; were lost. He became paranoid, believing that the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum. Mary was unable to care for her husband and it was anathema for a man of Hemingway&#x27;s generation to accept he suffered from mental illness. At the end of November, Saviers flew him to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota on the pretext that he was to be treated for hypertension. He was checked in under Saviers&#x27;s name to maintain anonymity.

Meyers writes that &quot;an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway&#x27;s treatment at the Mayo&quot; but confirms that he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as many as 15 times in December 1960. Reynolds gained access to Hemingway&#x27;s records at the Mayo, which document 10 ECT sessions. The doctors in Rochester told Hemingway the depressive state for which he was being treated may have been caused by his long-term use of Reserpine and Ritalin. Of the ECT therapy, Hemingway told Hotchner, &quot;What is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure, but we lost the patient.&quot; In late January 1961 he was sent home, as Meyers writes, &quot;in ruins&quot;. Asked to provide a tribute to President John F. Kennedy in February he could only produce a few sentences after a week&#x27;s effort.

A few months later, on April 21, Mary found Hemingway with a shotgun in the kitchen. She called Saviers, who admitted Hemingway to the Sun Valley Hospital under sedation. Once the weather cleared, Saviers flew again to Rochester with his patient. Hemingway underwent three electroshock treatments during that visit. He was released at the end of June and was home in Ketchum on June 30.

Two days later Hemingway &quot;quite deliberately&quot; shot himself with his favorite shotgun in the early morning hours of July 2, 1961. Meyers writes that he unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept, went upstairs to the front entrance foyer, &quot;pushed two shells into the twelve-gauge Boss shotgun ... put the end of the barrel into his mouth, pulled the trigger and blew out his brains.&quot; In 2010, however, it was argued that Hemingway never owned a Boss and that the suicide gun was actually made by W. &amp; C. Scott &amp; Son, his favorite one that was used at shooting competitions in Cuba, duck hunts in Italy or at a safari in East Africa.
When the authorities arrived, Mary was sedated and taken to the hospital. Returning to the house the next day, she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral and travel arrangements. Bernice Kert writes that it &quot;did not seem to her a conscious lie&quot; when she told the press that his death had been accidental. In a press interview five years later, Mary confirmed that he had shot himself. Family and friends flew to Ketchum for the funeral, officiated by the local Catholic priest, who believed that the death had been accidental. An altar boy fainted at the head of the casket during the funeral, and Hemingway&#x27;s brother Leicester wrote: &quot;It seemed to me Ernest would have approved of it all.&quot;

Hemingway&#x27;s behavior during his final years had been similar to that of his father before he killed himself; his father may have had hereditary hemochromatosis, whereby the excessive accumulation of iron in tissues culminates in mental and physical deterioration. Medical records made available in 1991 confirmed that Hemingway had been diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early 1961. His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed themselves.

Hemingway&#x27;s health was further complicated by heavy drinking throughout most of his life, which exacerbated his erratic behavior, and his head injuries increased the effects of the alcohol. The neuropsychiatrist Andrew Farah&#x27;s 2017 book &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Brain&quot;, offers a forensic examination of Hemingway&#x27;s mental illness. In her review of Farah&#x27;s book, Beegel writes that Farah postulates Hemingway suffered from the combination of depression, the side-effects of nine serious concussions, then, she writes, &quot;Add alcohol and stir&quot;. Farah writes that Hemingway&#x27;s concussions resulted in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which eventually led to a form of dementia, most likely dementia with Lewy bodies. He bases his hypothesis on Hemingway&#x27;s symptoms consistent with DLB, such as the various comorbidities, and most particularly the delusions, which surfaced as early as the late 1940s and were almost overwhelming during the final Ketchum years. Beegel writes that Farah&#x27;s study is convincing and &quot;should put an end to future speculation&quot;.

== Writing style ==
Following the tradition established by Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1926 of Hemingway&#x27;s first novel, &quot;No amount of analysis can convey the quality of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.&quot; &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, &quot;changed the nature of American writing&quot;. 

In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for &quot;his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.&quot; Henry Louis Gates believes Hemingway&#x27;s style was fundamentally shaped &quot;in reaction to [his] experience of world war&quot;. After World War I, he and other modernists &quot;lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization&quot; by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style &quot;in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences—a fiction in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—is stated explicitly.&quot;

Hemingway&#x27;s fiction often used grammatical and stylistic structures from languages other than English. Critics Allen Josephs, Mimi Gladstein, and Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera have studied how Spanish influenced Hemingway&#x27;s prose, which sometimes appears directly in the other language (in italics, as occurs in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;) or in English as literal translations. He also often used bilingual puns and crosslingual wordplay as stylistic devices.

Because he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to &quot;get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.&quot; Hemingway called his style the iceberg theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the &quot;theory of omission&quot;. Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;) though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else). 

Paul Smith writes that Hemingway&#x27;s first stories, collected as &quot;In Our Time&quot;, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style, and when he wrote about Spain or other countries he incorporated foreign words into the text, which sometimes appears directly in the other language, in italics, as occurs in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, or in English as literal translations. In general, he avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences without subordination—a simple childlike grammar structure.

Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios: &quot;what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?&quot; Writing in &quot;The Art of the Short Story&quot;, Hemingway explains: &quot;A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.&quot;

The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to Henry James&#x27;s observation that World War I had &quot;used up words&quot;. Hemingway offers a &quot;multi-focal&quot; photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic &quot;snapshot&quot; style creates a collage of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences.

The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an &quot;embedded text&quot; bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of &quot;cutting&quot; quickly from one scene to the next; or of &quot;splicing&quot; a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose. Conjunctions such as &quot;and&quot; are habitually used in place of commas; a use polysyndeton that conveys immediacy. Hemingway&#x27;s polysyndetonic sentence—or in later works his use of subordinate clauses—uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images. Benson compares them to haikus.

Many of Hemingway&#x27;s followers misinterpreted his style and frowned upon expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as &quot;Do you have emotions? Strangle them.&quot; Hemingway&#x27;s intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it realistically. As he explains in &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot;: &quot;In writing for a newspaper you told what happened ... but the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always, was beyond me&quot;. He tried to achieve conveying emotion with collages of images. This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. Hemingway&#x27;s letters refer to Proust&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.

== Themes ==
Hemingway&#x27;s writing includes themes of love, war, travel, expatriation, wilderness, and loss. Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as &quot;The Sacred Land&quot;—the American West—extended in Hemingway&#x27;s work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the &quot;Hotel Montana&quot; in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. In &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Expatriate Nationalism&quot;, Jeffrey Herlihy describes &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Transnational Archetype&quot; as one that involves characters who are &quot;multilingual and bicultural, and have integrated new cultural norms from the host community into their daily lives by the time plots begin.&quot; In this way, &quot;foreign scenarios, far from being mere exotic backdrops or cosmopolitan milieus, are motivating factors in-character action&quot;.

In Hemingway&#x27;s fiction, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey. Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature. Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport. At its core, much of Hemingway&#x27;s work can be viewed in the light of American naturalism, evident in detailed descriptions such as those in &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;.

Fiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil &quot;Dark Woman&quot; versus the good &quot;Light Woman&quot;. The dark woman—Brett Ashley of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;—is a goddess; the light woman—Margot Macomber of &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;—is a murderess. Robert Scholes says early Hemingway stories, such as &quot;A Very Short Story&quot;, present &quot;a male character favorably and a female unfavorably&quot;. According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into &quot;castrators or love-slaves&quot;. Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;, although more recent re-evaluations of his work &quot;have given new visibility to Hemingway&#x27;s female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.&quot; Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber &quot;are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway&#x27;s &#x27;bitch women.

Death permeates much of Hemingway&#x27;s work. Young believes the emphasis on death in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; was not so much on the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams, who witnesses these events and becomes a &quot;badly scarred and nervous young man&quot;. Young believes the archetype in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; holds the &quot;master key&quot; to &quot;what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career&quot;. Stoltzfus considers Hemingway&#x27;s work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if &quot;nothingness&quot; is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper &quot;The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field&quot;, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway&#x27;s fiction is successful because the characters live an &quot;authentic life&quot;, and the &quot;soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature&quot;.

Emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway&#x27;s work, notably in &quot;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn&#x27;s girlfriend in the beginning of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. 

In &quot;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, the emasculation is literal, and related to religious guilt. Baker believes Hemingway&#x27;s work emphasizes the &quot;natural&quot; versus the &quot;unnatural&quot;. In &quot;An Alpine Idyll&quot; the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of the peasant who allowed his wife&#x27;s dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the &quot;natural&quot; spring for redemption.

In recent decades, critics have characterized Hemingway&#x27;s work as misogynistic and homophobic. Susan Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that &quot;critics interested in multiculturalism&quot; simply ignored Hemingway. Typical is this analysis of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;: &quot;Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.&quot; During the same decade, according to Beegel, criticism was published that investigated the &quot;horror of homosexuality&quot; and racism in Hemingway&#x27;s fiction. In an overall assessment of Hemingway&#x27;s work Beegel has written: &quot;Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==

Hemingway&#x27;s legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it. After his reputation was established with the publication of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, he became the spokesperson for the post–World War I generation, having established a style to follow. His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, &quot;as being a monument of modern decadence&quot;, and disavowed by his parents as &quot;filth&quot;. Reynolds asserts the legacy is that &quot;[Hemingway] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.&quot; 

Benson believes the details of Hemingway&#x27;s life have become a &quot;prime vehicle for exploitation&quot;, resulting in a Hemingway industry. The Hemingway scholar believes the &quot;hard-boiled style&quot; and the machismo must be separated from the author himself. Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J. D. Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio. 

During World War II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence. In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks &quot;had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war&quot; and jokingly &quot;named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs&quot;. In 2002, a fossil billfish from the Danata Formation of Turkmenistan was named &quot;Hemingwaya&quot; after Hemingway, who prominently featured a marlin in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;.

Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation in 1965, and in the 1970s, she donated her husband&#x27;s papers to the John F. Kennedy Library. In 1980, a group of Hemingway scholars gathered to assess the donated papers, subsequently forming the Hemingway Society, &quot;committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship&quot;, publishing &quot;The Hemingway Review&quot;. His granddaughter Margaux Hemingway was a supermodel and actress and co-starred with her younger sister Mariel in the 1976 movie &quot;Lipstick&quot;. Her death was later ruled a death by suicide.

<doc id="9429" wikidata="Q498983" url="?curid=9429" title="Young and Innocent">
<text>Young and Innocent, released in the US as The Girl Was Young, is a 1937 British crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney. Based on the 1936 novel &quot;A Shilling for Candles&quot; by Josephine Tey, the film is about a young man on the run from a murder charge who enlists the help of a woman who must put herself at risk for his cause. An elaborately staged crane shot Hitchcock devised, which appears towards the end of the film, identifies the real murderer.

==Plot==
On a stormy night, at a retreat on the English coast, Christine Clay, a successful actress, argues passionately with her jealous ex-husband Guy. Not accepting her Reno divorce as valid, he accuses her of having an affair. Finally, she slaps him and he leaves the room. His eyes twitch violently.

The next morning, writer Robert Tisdall is walking along the seaside when Christine&#x27;s dead body washes ashore. He recognizes her, and runs for help. Two young women arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. The police quickly decide that Tisdall is the only suspect. Christine was strangled with the belt from a raincoat; his raincoat is missing and he says it was recently stolen. He admits having known Christine for three years since he sold her a story. 

Scotland Yard detectives grill him all night. They suggest he was having an affair with Christine. When they tell him she left him a large sum of money in her will, he faints. He is revived with the aid of Erica Burgoyne, daughter of the local police Chief Constable. Tisdall is assigned an incompetent solicitor, and is taken into court for his formal arraignment. Doubting if his innocence will ever be established, he takes advantage of overcrowding in the courthouse to escape. He gets away by riding on the running board of Erica&#x27;s Morris car, revealing himself to her after the car runs out of petrol.

He helps push the car to a filling station, pays for petrol, and convinces her to give him a ride. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Erica eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and decides to help him. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run from the police. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat: if it still has its belt, the one found next to Christine&#x27;s body must not be his.

The duo succeed in tracing Tisdall&#x27;s coat to Old Will, a homeless china-mender. But Will was not the thief; he was given the coat by a man with &quot;twitchy eyes&quot;, and with its belt already missing.

After becoming separated from the others, Erica is taken in by the police. Upon realizing that his daughter has fully allied herself with a murder suspect, her father chooses to resign his position rather than arrest her for assisting a felon. Tisdall sneaks into their house to see Erica, intending to surrender and assert he kidnapped her, but she mentions that the coat had a box of matches from the Grand Hotel in a pocket. As Tisdall has never been there, he surmises perhaps the murderer has a connection to the hotel.

The following evening, Erica and Will go to the hotel together, hoping to find him. It is revealed that Guy is the drummer in band in the hotel ballroom, performing in blackface. His eyes are twitching.

Recognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (who have actually followed Will, hoping he would lead them to Tisdall), Guy performs poorly due to fear. He is berated by the conductor and, during a break, takes medicine to try to control the twitching, but it makes him very sleepy. Eventually, in mid-performance, Guy passes out, drawing the attention of Erica and the police. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.

==Production==
The film was the first of two Hitchcock made for producer Ted Black, the other being &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;.
==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;Pleasing, artless vehicle&quot; for Nova Pilbeam, who was &quot;charming&quot; in her role and concluded, &quot;If the pic is not Hitchcock&#x27;s best effort, it is by no means unworthy of him.&quot; Frank Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;crisply paced, excellently performed film.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Innumerable small touches show Hitchcock&#x27;s keen and penetrating observation and his knowledge of human nature. Comedy, romance, and thrills are skilfully blended.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Good melodramatic entertainment. Because of the novelty of the story, the interesting plot developments, and the expert direction by Alfred Hitchcock, one&#x27;s attention is held from the beginning to the end.&quot; 

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, however, wrote that it was &quot;rather exasperating and disappointing to me. It begins with a smart murder, but wanders off through the English rural landscape in a fashion so lacking in that sound common sense we like in our mysteries, or like to feel is there anyhow, that one&#x27;s interest fades away.&quot;

Aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval of &quot;Young and Innocent&quot;, with an average rating of 7.6/10.

==Changes from the novel==
Significant changes were made in adapting the book for the film. The novel is a whodunit centred on the Scotland Yard inspector, who is Tey&#x27;s regular character Alan Grant. The storyline involving Robert Tisdall, Erica Burgoyne, and the missing coat is similar to the film story, but in the novel it is only a subplot and ends part way through the book when Erica finds the coat and it is intact. Grant then focuses on other suspects, none of whom (including the actual murderer in the novel) appear in the film. Christine Clay in the novel is not divorced, but is in an unconventional marriage to an aristocrat.

==Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo==
Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. He can be seen outside the courthouse, holding a camera, at 14 minutes into the film.

==Copyright status and home media==
&quot;Young and Innocent&quot; is copyrighted worldwide but has been heavily bootlegged for home video. Despite this, licensed releases have appeared on Blu-ray, DVD and video on demand services worldwide from the likes of Network Distributing in the UK, MGM and The Criterion Collection in the US, and others.

<doc id="9432" wikidata="Q7769349" url="?curid=9432" title="The Time in Between">
<text>The Time in Between is a novel by Canadian author David Bergen. It deals with a man, who mysteriously returns to Vietnam, where he had been a soldier earlier in his life, followed by his children, who also go to Vietnam to search for him. The novel was the recipient of the Scotiabank Giller Prize and the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 2005.

== Plot ==
Charles Boatman, an army veteran suddenly disappears and his daughter Ada and her younger brother Jon on finding some clues go looking out for him in Danang, Vietnam. The novel mixes various stories from different timeframes narrating Charles&#x27;s days in Washington when he was young. He married Sara and had daughter Ada while living in Fraser Valley of British Columbia. He gets posted in the wartime era to Vietnam and serves there and upon arrival discovers his wife&#x27;s infidelity. Sara dies early and by then they also had a son Jon. Charles keeps getting nightmares of his Vietnam days on how he killed an innocent civilian boy in one of the operations and this keeps haunting him. On the other hand, Ada is on a mission to find her father and is helped by a local guy Yen who becomes her guide and guardian in the new country. She engages in a sexual relationship with an older man, Hoang Vu who is an artist by profession. Jon indulges in the nightlife of Vietnam, and Ada keeps getting closer to her father as she travels across the country. Charles discovers author Dang Tho&#x27;s novel chronicling wartime and this helps him find some peace.

== Publication and development ==
The book is author David Bergen&#x27;s fifth novel. Although generally called a war novel, the author states that he &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] see &quot;The Time in Between&quot; as a war novel&quot;. The book was released as Audio book by Blackstone Audio in December 2005 and was narrated by Anna Fields, better known as Kate Fleming.

== Reviews and reception ==
&quot;Kirkus reviews&quot; called the novel a &quot;beautifully composed, unflinching and harrowing story&quot;. Nicholas Dinka in their &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot; review mentions that the novel has &quot;much decency and intelligence&quot; and both the stories of the novel are &quot;entirely plausible&quot; but criticises for &quot;remarkable dourness of its prose&quot;. While Dennis Lythgoe of &quot;Deseret News&quot; noted that &quot;Bergen&#x27;s book lives and breathes the Vietnam experience&quot;; Ron Charles in his &quot;The Washington Post&quot; review mentioned that &quot;Bergen&#x27;s ability to dramatize trauma-induced disaffection is undeniable; whether readers will want to sink down that hole with his characters is less clear&quot;. Irene Wanner of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; appreciated the novel for its writing.

The novel won the Scotiabank Giller Prize in 2005 while being nominated along with &quot;Luck&quot; (by Joan Barfoot), &quot;Sweetness in the Belly&quot; (by Camilla Gibb), &quot;Alligator&quot; (by Lisa Moore), and &quot;A Wall of Light&quot; (by Edeet Ravel). The judges Warren Cariou, Elizabeth Hay, and Richard B. Wright noted &quot;&quot;The Time in Between&quot; explores our need to understand the relationship between love and duty...[] This is a subtle and elegantly written novel by an author in complete command of his talent&quot;. It also won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 2005. Bergen had earlier won the award in 1996 for &quot;A Year of Lesser&quot; and later again won in 2009 for &quot;The Retreat&quot;. Dan Zigmond of &quot;SFGate&quot; reviews the novel as &quot;a rich and rewarding novel&quot;.

<text>Spain in Flames is a 1937 compilation film made by Helen van Dongen during the Spanish Civil War. Hal Erickson has written that the film &quot;... is remarkable in its willingness to offer both sides of the conflict -- though its sympathies are firmly with the Loyalists.&quot; The film consists of two parts. The first, &quot;The Fight for Freedom&quot;, was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary &quot;Spain and the Fight for Freedom&quot;. A foreword by the then Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Fernando de los Ríos, began one of the film&#x27;s screenings in New York in 1937.

The second part, &quot;They Shalt Not Pass&quot;, was based on a short film &quot;No Pasaran!&quot; done by the Artkino Film Company of the Soviet Union, where van Dongen was working at the time the film was made. John Dos Passos narrated parts of the film, and the commentary was written by Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Archibald MacLeish, and Prudencio de Pareda. Erickson writes that, &quot;The horrendous images of battlefield carnage, not to mention the close-ups of suffering and dying Spanish children, still pack a wallop when seen today.&quot;

Later, Hemingway, Dos Passos, Lillian Hellman and others founded the company Contemporary Historians, which produced another film called &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot; (1937), directed by Joris Ivens and edited by van Dongen.

&quot;Spain in Flames&quot; was banned in New Brunswick, New Jersey and Waterbury, Connecticut. A screening of the film, accompanied by a speech from Granville Hicks, was also banned in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

<text>The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on March 8, 1994, by Nothing Records in the United States and Island Records in Europe. It is a concept album detailing the self-destruction of a man from the beginning of his misanthropic &quot;downward spiral&quot; to his suicidal breaking point. The album was a commercial success and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated, and the band receiving media attention and multiple honors.

Trent Reznor, the band&#x27;s sole official member at the time, had moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the site of the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of the Manson Family in 1969; it was transformed into a studio for recording the &quot;Broken&quot; EP (1992) and subsequently &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band&#x27;s synth-pop-influenced debut album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space.

&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; was praised for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes, and it has since been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 1990s, although it was sensationalized by social conservatives for some of its lyrics. The album spawned two lead singles, &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot;, in addition to the promotional singles &quot;Piggy&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot;. The lead singles were accompanied by music videos, with the former shot twice and the latter being heavily censored. A remix album titled &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; was released in 1995.

==Writing and recording==

Reznor conceived of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; after Nine Inch Nails&#x27; run in the lineup of the Lollapalooza festival tour, feeling increasingly alienated and disinterested. The band&#x27;s concerts were known for their radical onstage dynamic in which members acted aggressively, injured themselves, destroyed instruments, and polluted stages. Reznor had begun to feud with TVT Records, resulting in him co-founding Nothing Records with his then-manager John Malm, Jr. as a subsidiary of Interscope. Simultaneously, he began fleshing out the concept for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, focusing on the life and death of a misanthropic man who rebels against humanity, and kills God before attempting suicide. Reznor frequently struggled with drug addiction and depression, and the themes of the album gradually allegorized his living situation. His peers at some point recommended him the antidepressant Prozac, but he declined to be medicated.

Reznor wanted the album&#x27;s sound to diverge from the abrasion of &quot;Broken&quot;, emphasizing mood, texture, restraint and subtlety, although he was unsure about its musical direction. He decided to utilize &quot;full range&quot; sound, focusing on texture and space, and avoiding conventional usage of guitars or synthesizers with a recognizable sound palette. Subsequently, he mainly worked with a Macintosh computer, using music editor programs on the computer to distort frequencies in guitar and bass parts as a form of sound design, and creating collages of sounds with Pro Tools.

Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in 1992 for recording &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, a decision made against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans. 10050 Cielo Drive is referred to as the &quot;Tate House&quot; since Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969; Reznor named the studio &quot;Le Pig&quot; after the message that was scrawled on the front door with Tate&#x27;s blood by her murderers, and stayed there with Malm for 18 months. He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive &quot;terrifying&quot; because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting.

Reznor collaborated with the Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins, the progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew, and the Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. Belew&#x27;s first visit to the studio involved playing the guitar parts in &quot;Mr. Self-Destruct&quot;, and he was told to play freely, think on reacting to melodies, concentrate on rhythm, and use noise. This approach improved Reznor&#x27;s confidence in the instrument: he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface. Belew praised Reznor for his &quot;command of technology,&quot; and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations &quot;that are in [his] realm.&quot; Vrenna and Perkins played drum parts recorded live in the studio; the tracks were rendered into looped samples. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20- to 25-minute-long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer.

Reznor frequently sampled excerpts from his guitar session tracks and processed them to sporadic and expressive points to convey the album&#x27;s themes, also doing the same with drum parts. Digidesign&#x27;s TurboSynth and Zoom 9030 effects unit were used extensively to process guitar tracks, often in conjunction with a Marshall JMP-1 preamp; Zoom 9030 was also used to distort vocals. Acoustic drums in various settings, as well as Roland&#x27;s TR-808 and R-70 drum machines, which were sampled through multiple Akai S1000s and a Kurzweil K2000. Additionally, Vrenna had compiled various movie samples on Digital Audio Tapes for Reznor to sample, which were gradually identified by fans in the decades following the album&#x27;s release. Other equipment and software Reznor used for recording the album included the Oberheim OB-Mx, Moog Minimoog, Sequential Circuits Prophet VS keyboard, Eventide H3000 Harmonizer, Pro Tools and various Jackson and Gibson guitars.

In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tate&#x27;s death in the house. Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:

The British producer and engineer Flood, who previously engineered and co-produced Nine Inch Nails&#x27; debut album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; and &quot;Broken&quot;, was brought back to co-produce &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;; although it would be his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails due to creative differences. For instance, a &quot;very dangerously self-destructive&quot; yet humorous short song written for the album, &quot;Just Do It&quot;, was not included in the final version, criticized by Flood who said that Reznor had &quot;gone too far.&quot; Reznor completed the last song written for the album, &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot;, in late 1993. After the album&#x27;s recording, Reznor moved out and the house was demolished shortly thereafter. &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; entered its mixing and mastering processes, done at the Record Plant and A&amp;M Studios with Alan Moulder, who subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future album releases.

==Music and lyrics==

Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays nihilism and is defined by a prominent theme of self-abuse and self-control. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist&#x27;s descent into madness in his own inner solipsistic world through a metaphorical &quot;downward spiral&quot;, dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide. Reznor described the concept as consisting of &quot;someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on.&quot; Media journalists like &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Jon Pareles noted the album&#x27;s theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana, and that Nine Inch Nails&#x27; depiction was more generalized.

Using elements of genres such as techno, dance, electronic, heavy metal, and hard rock, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; is considered an industrial rock, alternative rock, industrial metal, industrial, and art rock album. Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow verse–chorus form, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony (or both). The treatment of metal guitars in &quot;Broken&quot; is carried over to &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures. The album features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of the central protagonist. Reznor&#x27;s singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end, frequently moving from whispers to screams. These techniques are all used in the song &quot;Hurt&quot;, which features a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word &quot;I&quot; every time the B/E# dyad is played.

&quot;Mr. Self Destruct&quot;, a song about a powerful person, follows a build-up sampled from the 1971 film &quot;THX 1138&quot; with an &quot;industrial roar&quot; and is accompanied by an audio loop of a pinion rotating. &quot;The Becoming&quot; expresses the state of being dead and the protagonist&#x27;s transformation into a non-human organism. &quot;Closer&quot; concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is introduced during the second verse of &quot;Piggy&quot; on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of &quot;Heresy&quot;, and recurs for the final time on &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The album was chiefly inspired by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot;, an experimental rock album which Reznor related to on songwriting, mood, and structures, as well as progressive rock group Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, a concept album featuring themes of abuse, isolation, and mental instability.

==Packaging==
&quot;Committere&quot;, an installation featuring artwork and sketches for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; by Russell Mills was displayed at the Glasgow School of Art. Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting (titled &quot;Wound&quot;) that was used for the album&#x27;s cover art:

==Promotion==

===Singles===
&quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; were released as singles; two other songs, &quot;Hurt&quot; and &quot;Piggy&quot;, were issued to radio without a commercial single release. &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; has an unusual meter, alternating three bars of 7/8 time with one of 8/8. The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Peter Christopherson and was shot twice; the first version scrapped due to Reznor&#x27;s involvement, and the released second version being a live performance.

&quot;Closer&quot; features a heavily modified bass drum sample from the Iggy Pop song &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; from his album &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Lyrically, it is a meditation on self-hatred and obsession, but to Reznor&#x27;s dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which included the line &quot;I wanna fuck you like an animal&quot;. Reznor later stated: “It’s supernegative and superhateful. It’s &#x27;I am a piece of shit and I am declaring that and if you think you want me, here I am.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t think it would become a frat-party anthem or a titty-dancer anthem.” 

The music video for &quot;Closer&quot; was directed by Mark Romanek and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig&#x27;s head spinning on a machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&amp;M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially censored the song&#x27;s explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime. The video has since been made part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

&quot;Piggy&quot; uses &quot;nothing can stop me now&quot;, a line that recurs in &quot;Ruiner&quot; and &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot;. The frantic drumming on the song&#x27;s outro is Reznor&#x27;s only attempt at performing drums on the record, and one of the few &quot;live&quot; drum performances on the album. He had stated that the recording was from him testing the microphone setup in studio, but he liked the sound too much not to include it. It was released as a promotional single in December 1994 and reached the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Released in 1995, &quot;Hurt&quot;, final track of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; song, includes references to self-harm and heroin addiction; while other people claims that it describes the difficult process of finding a reason to live in spite of depression and pain and does not have much to do with the storyline of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;.

===Self Destruct Tour===
The Nine Inch Nails live band embarked on the Self Destruct tour in support of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively, Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and the bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as &quot;Hurt&quot;. The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very few actual ones. The tour debuted the band&#x27;s grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.

The tour included a set at Woodstock &#x27;94 broadcast on pay-per-view and seen in as many as 24 million homes. Contrary to the widely-held belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, the band said that being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play. However, in 2024, backstage home video emerged on Youtube showing Reznor asking the stage manager to give them &quot;5 minutes for mud&quot; when discussing show timings for getting to the stage and debating whether to find a mud pit or bring some into the dressing room in a bucket. The mud made it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails were widely proclaimed to have &quot;stolen the show&quot; from their popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and their fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented about the band&#x27;s Woodstock &#x27;94 performance: &quot;Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core—an experience as draining as it is exhilarating&quot;. Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.

The main leg of the tour featured Marilyn Manson as the supporting act, who featured the bassist Jeordie White (then playing under the pseudonym &quot;Twiggy Ramirez&quot;); White later played bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. After another tour leg supporting the remix album &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;, Nine Inch Nails contributed to the Alternative Nation Festival in Australia and subsequently embarked on the Dissonance Tour, which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner David Bowie on his Outside Tour. Nine Inch Nails was the opening act for the tour, and its set transitioned into Bowie&#x27;s set with joint performances of both bands&#x27; songs. However, the crowds reportedly did not respond positively to the pairing due to their creative differences. Despite this, in a 2012 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll, the tour (pairing Nine Inch Nails with Bowie) was named one of the top 10 opening acts in rock history.

The tour concluded with &quot;Nights of Nothing&quot;, a three-night showcase of performances from Nothing Records bands Marilyn Manson, Prick, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Pop Will Eat Itself, which ended with an 80-minute set from Nine Inch Nails. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described the Nine Inch Nails set during the Nights of Nothing showcase as &quot;tight, brash and dramatic&quot;, but was disappointed at the lack of new material. On the second of the three nights, Richard Patrick was briefly reunited with the band and contributed guitar to a performance of &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;. After the Self Destruct tour, Chris Vrenna, who had been a member of the live band since 1988 and frequent contributor to Nine Inch Nails studio recordings, left the act permanently to pursue a career in producing and to form Tweaker.

==Release and reception==

&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;″s release date was delayed at various times to slow down Reznor&#x27;s intended pace of the album&#x27;s recording. The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a writer&#x27;s block as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material. Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress, but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom. He told the producer Rick Rubin that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished, thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard. Reznor realized that he was in the most fortunate situation he imagined when the album was recorded with a normal budget, &quot;cool&quot; equipment, and a studio to work at.

Released on March 8, 1994, to instant success, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling nearly 119,000 copies in its first week. On October 28, 1998, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quadruple platinum, and by December 2011, it had sold 3.7 million copies in the United States. The album peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, and on July 22, 2013, it was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments in excess of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It reached number 13 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; albums chart and received a triple platinum certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipping 200,000 copies in Canada. A group of early listeners of the album viewed it as &quot;commercial suicide&quot;, but Reznor did not make it for profit as his goal was to slightly broaden Nine Inch Nails&#x27; scope. Reznor felt that the finished product he delivered to Interscope was complete and faithful to his vision and thought its commercial potential was limited, but after its release he was surprised by the success and received questions about a follow-up single with a music video to be shown on MTV. The album has since sold over four million copies worldwide.

Many music critics and audiences praised &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Jon Pareles&#x27; review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb, &quot;Reznor writes full-fledged tunes&quot; with stronger use of melodies than riffs. He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the album&#x27;s transgression. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave it an &quot;honorable mention&quot; in his capsule review column and summed the record up as, &quot;musically, Hieronymus Bosch as postindustrial atheist; lyrically, Transformers as kiddie porn.&quot; Jonathan Gold, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, likened the album to cyberpunk fiction. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Tom Sinclair commented: &quot;Reznor&#x27;s pet topics (sex, power, S&amp;M, hatred, transcendence) are all here, wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; has been listed on several publications&#x27; best album lists. In 2003, the album was ranked number 200 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then was re-ranked 201 in a 2012 revised list. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff wrote: &quot;Holing up in the one-time home of Manson-family victim Sharon Tate, Trent Reznor made an overpowering meditation on NIN&#x27;s central theme: control.&quot; It moved up to 122 on the magazine&#x27;s revised list in 2020. The album was placed 10th on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years&quot; list; the &quot;Spin&quot; staff quoted Ann Powers&#x27; review that appreciated its bleak, aggressive style. It was ranked number 488 in the book &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; by heavy metal music critic Martin Popoff. In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;; in 2010, the album was ranked number 102 on their &quot;250 Best Albums of Q&#x27;s Lifetime (1986–2011)&quot; list. &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; was featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In May 2014, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; at number two on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; at number 43 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

==Legacy==

The immediate success of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s. The band&#x27;s image and musical style became so recognizable that a Gatorade commercial featured a remix of &quot;Down in It&quot; without their involvement. Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned, received false reports of his death, depression, and was falsely reported to have had a relationship with serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, and was depicted as a sex icon. Nine Inch Nails received several honors, including Grammy Award nominations for Best Alternative Performance for &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; and Best Rock Song for &quot;Hurt&quot;. After the release of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, many bands such as Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, Filter, and Mötley Crüe made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails.

Reznor interpreted &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as an extension of himself that &quot;became the truth fulfilling itself,&quot; as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release. He had already struggled with social anxiety disorder and depression and started his abuse of narcotics including cocaine while he went on an alcohol binge. Around this time, his studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer&#x27;s block prolonged the production of &quot;The Fragile&quot;, and Reznor completed rehabilitation from drugs in 2001.

One year after &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;’s release, the band released an accompanying remix album titled &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;. It features contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, J. G. Thirlwell, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. The album peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received mixed reviews. &quot;Recoiled&quot;, a remix EP of &quot;Gave Up&quot;, &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, and &quot;Eraser&quot; by Coil, was released on February 24, 2014, via British record label Cold Spring.

Retrospective reviews regard &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and Reznor&#x27;s greatest work. The 2004 edition of &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the album five out of five stars and called it &quot;a powerful statement, and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of &quot;Closer&quot; on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on the radio to albums with cover art. &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Adrien Begrand of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; considers &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; to be an &quot;over-the-top masterpiece&quot; that ranks alongside My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991) as the best-produced album of the 1990s.

==Controversies==
===&quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; lyrics===
&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;″s emphasis on transgressive themes drew criticism from American social conservatives. Senator Bob Dole, then the head of the Republican Party, sharply denounced Time Warner, the former owner of Interscope&#x27;s former parent company Warner Music Group, after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs (head of WMG), William Bennett, and C. Delores Tucker. During the meeting, Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs recite lyrics from &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot;. Interscope had previously been blamed for releasing gangsta rap albums by rappers such as Dr. Dre, 2Pac and Snoop Dogg that were deemed objectionable. Reznor called Tucker (who erroneously referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangsta rap act) &quot;such a fucking idiot&quot;, and claimed that the song was actually a satire of the gangsta rap genre as a whole and was originally about madness. Reznor conceded &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; could be &quot;harmful, through implying and subliminally suggesting things&quot;, whereas hardcore hip hop could be &quot;cartoonish&quot;. Robert Bork also repeatedly referenced &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; in his book &quot;Slouching Toward Gomorrah&quot; as evidence of a supposed cultural decline.

===Alleged contribution to the Columbine shooting===
Before the Columbine High School massacre, perpetrator Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs multiple times in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as a symbol of his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot; for their alleged contribution to the environment that made incidents like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry&#x27;s marketing practices to minors.

===iPhone application refusal===
In 2009, Apple rejected a proposal for a Nine Inch Nails iPhone software application, citing objectionable content in the title track. Days later, Apple reversed the decision, but refused to explain its reasoning; however, they noted that the app has &quot;objectionable content&quot;. In response to this action, Reznor tweeted &quot;The NIN iPhone app is unchanged, the &#x27;issues&#x27; seem to have been resolved&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Original release===
Notes
* The opening sounds of &quot;Mr. Self Destruct&quot; are a sample from the film &quot;THX 1138&quot; in which a man is being beaten by a prison guard.
* The sample of screams that plays throughout &quot;The Becoming&quot; is from the film &quot;Robot Jox&quot;, when a giant robot falls on a crowd of spectators.
* The sample at the beginning of &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; comes from a studio-altered recording of a porn star having an orgasm. According to the album booklet, this &quot;sample&quot; is titled &quot;Steakhouse&quot; and is credited to Tommy Lee. The drumbeat is the same as on &#x27;Stinking Drunk&#x27; by Big Black from their 1986 Atomizer LP.
* Japanese pressings of the album contain a cover of Joy Division&#x27;s song &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, originally included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Crow&quot;. The track is placed in between &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; and &quot;A Warm Place&quot;.
* The break in &quot;Reptile&quot; contains an audio sample (starting at 5:06) of a woman falling down a hill from the 1974 film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;.
* The first Australian pressing has track length errors. Affected tracks do not play at their beginnings when selected individually (&quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; has the beginning of &quot;A Warm Place&quot; tacked on, likewise all the songs up to &quot;Hurt&quot; start 41 seconds earlier than they should. &quot;Hurt&quot; itself has 44 seconds of silence on the end as a result); however, the disc plays and flows correctly as a whole.

===Deluxe edition (Halo 8 DE)===
To mark the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; was re-released on November 23, 2004, in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc one of the album&#x27;s deluxe edition re-release is nearly identical to the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.
&quot;DualDisc&quot; (Halo 8 DVD-A)

The DualDisc edition of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; contains the same CD content on Side A as the Deluxe Edition, with a DVD-Audio layer on Side B. When played on DVD-Video players a Dolby Digital 5.1 multi-channel or Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo mix of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; can be selected, along with videos of &quot;March of the Pigs&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot; and an uncensored video of &quot;Closer&quot;. There is also an interactive discography and an image gallery. High resolution 24-bit/48 kHz 5.1 Surround sound and stereo versions of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; can be played on a DVD-Audio player, allowing the user a similar high fidelity experience as the SACD layer of the Deluxe Edition. The DualDisc release does not contain the additional B-sides and demo tracks.

<text>Gregory James Broussard (born August 31, 1963), better known by his stage name Egyptian Lover, is an American musician, vocalist, producer and DJ, and was a part of the L.A. dance music, electro, and rap scene in the early 1980s.

== History ==
The Egyptian Lover was born in Los Angeles, California, and started out there as a DJ with Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army, DJing dances as large as the L.A. Sports Arena with 10,000 people. He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, as well as Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army. Members of Uncle Jamm&#x27;s Army and the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, including Dr. Dre, The Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover, Ice-T and Kid Frost would later go on to help define the early West Coast Hip-Hop sound throughout the 1980s.

Most of the Egyptian Lover&#x27;s successful recordings were 12&quot; singles. &quot;Egypt, Egypt&quot; was one of the most popular, which was called part of the &quot;b-boy canon.&quot; He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular commercially than his singles. On the strength of an alternative mix of his most popular single &quot;Egypt, Egypt&quot;, 1984&#x27;s &quot;On the Nile&quot; was moderately successful, reaching the Billboard Top 200. It was called &quot;one of the first hip-hop records to come out of the left coast&quot;. He also collaborated with several other hip-hop and dance music artists. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with &quot;Back from the Tomb&quot;, his first full-length album in over ten years.

The Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as Rodney O &amp; Joe Cooley, 2 O&#x27;Clock, and Te &amp; Joezee.

His 2015 release, &quot;1984&quot;, continues his tradition of using all analog equipment, including the Roland TR-808, along with much of the same gear used on his recordings of the 1980s. The name &quot;1984&quot; refers to his earlier albums. The album was recorded at Skip Saylor, Encore Studios, and at RUSK Studios, the same studio where &quot;On The Nile&quot; was recorded in 1984. It is widely available on double gatefold LP, CD and cassette tape.

<text>Electrical telegraphy is a point-to-point text messaging system, primarily used from the 1840s until the late 20th century. It was the first electrical telecommunications system and the most widely used of a number of early messaging systems called &quot;telegraphs&quot;, that were devised to send text messages more quickly than physically carrying them. Electrical telegraphy can be considered the first example of electrical engineering. 

Text telegraphy consisted of two or more geographically separated stations, called telegraph offices. The offices were connected by wires, usually supported overhead on utility poles. Many electrical telegraph systems were invented that operated in different ways, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories. First are the needle telegraphs, in which electric current sent down the telegraph line produces electromagnetic force to move a needle-shaped pointer into position over a printed list. Early needle telegraph models used multiple needles, thus requiring multiple wires to be installed between stations. The first commercial needle telegraph system and the most widely used of its type was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, invented in 1837. The second category are armature systems, in which the current activates a telegraph sounder that makes a click; communication on this type of system relies on sending clicks in coded rhythmic patterns. The archetype of this category was the Morse system and the code associated with it, both invented by Samuel Morse in 1838. In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication, using a modified form of Morse&#x27;s code that had been developed for German railways.

Electrical telegraphs were used by the emerging railway companies to provide signals for train control systems, minimizing the chances of trains colliding with each other. This was built around the signalling block system in which signal boxes along the line communicate with neighbouring boxes by telegraphic sounding of single-stroke bells and three-position needle telegraph instruments.

In the 1840s, the electrical telegraph superseded optical telegraph systems such as semaphores, becoming the standard way to send urgent messages. By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had commercial telegraph networks with local telegraph offices in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages (called telegrams) addressed to any person in the country, for a fee. 

Beginning in 1850, submarine telegraph cables allowed for the first rapid communication between people on different continents. The telegraph&#x27;s nearly-instant transmission of messages across continents and between continents had widespread social and economic impacts. The electric telegraph led to Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s invention of wireless telegraphy, the first means of radiowave telecommunication, which he began in 1894. 

In the early 20th century, manual operation of telegraph machines was slowly replaced by teleprinter networks. Increasing use of the telephone pushed telegraphy into only a few specialist uses; its use by the general public dwindled to greetings for special occasions. The rise of the Internet and email in the 1990s largely made dedicated telegraphy networks obsolete.

== History ==

=== Precursors ===

Prior to the electric telegraph, visual systems were used, including beacons, smoke signals, flag semaphore, and optical telegraphs for visual signals to communicate over distances of land. 

An auditory predecessor was West African talking drums. In the 19th century, Yoruba drummers used talking drums to mimic human tonal language to communicate complex messages – usually regarding news of birth, ceremonies, and military conflict – over 4–5 mile distances.

Possibly the earliest design and conceptualization for a telegraph system was by the British polymath Robert Hooke, who gave a vivid and comprehensive outline of visual telegraphy to the Royal Society in a 1684 submission in which he outlined many practical details. The system was largely motivated by military concerns, following the Battle of Vienna in 1683.

The first official optical telegraph was invented in France in the 18th century by Claude Chappe and his brothers. The Chappe system would stretch nearly 5,000 km with 556 stations and was used until the 1850s.

===Early work===

From early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to communications at a distance. All the known effects of electricitysuch as sparks, electrostatic attraction, chemical changes, electric shocks, and later electromagnetismwere applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.
In 1753, an anonymous writer in the &quot;Scots Magazine&quot; suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of pith balls at the far end. The writer has never been positively identified, but the letter was signed C.M. and posted from Renfrew leading to a Charles Marshall of Renfrew being suggested. Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.

In 1774, Georges-Louis Le Sage realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the alphabet and its range was only between two rooms of his home.

In 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the voltaic pile, providing a continuous current of electricity for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an electrostatic machine, which with Leyden jars were the only previously known human-made sources of electricity.
Another very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an &quot;electrochemical telegraph&quot; created by the German physician, anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmering in 1809, based on an earlier 1804 design by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering&#x27;s design), with each of the telegraph receiver&#x27;s wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient&#x27;s end, the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver&#x27;s operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message. This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).
Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year Johann Schweigger invented the galvanometer, with a coil of wire around a compass, that could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current. Also that year, André-Marie Ampère suggested that telegraphy could be achieved by placing small magnets under the ends of a set of wires, one pair of wires for each letter of the alphabet. He was apparently unaware of Schweigger&#x27;s invention at the time, which would have made his system much more sensitive. In 1825, Peter Barlow tried Ampère&#x27;s idea but only got it to work over and declared it impractical. In 1830 William Ritchie improved on Ampère&#x27;s design by placing the magnetic needles inside a coil of wire connected to each pair of conductors. He successfully demonstrated it, showing the feasibility of the electromagnetic telegraph, but only within a lecture hall.
In 1825, William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet, with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished iron, which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. Joseph Henry improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires. During his tenure at The Albany Academy from 1826 to 1832, Henry first demonstrated the theory of the &#x27;magnetic telegraph&#x27; by ringing a bell through of wire strung around the room in 1831.

In 1835, Joseph Henry and Edward Davy independently invented the mercury dipping electrical relay, in which a magnetic needle is dipped into a pot of mercury when an electric current passes through the surrounding coil. In 1837, Davy invented the much more practical metallic make-and-break relay which became the relay of choice in telegraph systems and a key component for periodically renewing weak signals. Davy demonstrated his telegraph system in Regent&#x27;s Park in 1837 and was granted a patent on 4 July 1838. Davy also invented a printing telegraph which used the electric current from the telegraph signal to mark a ribbon of calico infused with potassium iodide and calcium hypochlorite.

===First working systems===
The first working telegraph was built by the English inventor Francis Ronalds in 1816 and used static electricity. At the family home on Hammersmith Mall, he set up a complete subterranean system in a long trench as well as an long overhead telegraph. The lines were connected at both ends to revolving dials marked with the letters of the alphabet and electrical impulses sent along the wire were used to transmit messages. Offering his invention to the Admiralty in July 1816, it was rejected as &quot;wholly unnecessary&quot;. His account of the scheme and the possibilities of rapid global communication in &quot;Descriptions of an Electrical Telegraph and of some other Electrical Apparatus&quot; was the first published work on electric telegraphy and even described the risk of signal retardation due to induction. Elements of Ronalds&#x27; design were utilised in the subsequent commercialisation of the telegraph over 20 years later.

The Schilling telegraph, invented by Baron Schilling von Canstatt in 1832, was an early needle telegraph. It had a transmitting device that consisted of a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current. The receiving instrument consisted of six galvanometers with magnetic needles, suspended from silk threads. The two stations of Schilling&#x27;s telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the galvanometers, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus by reducing the number of connecting wires from eight to two.
On 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from Nicholas I of Russia. Schilling&#x27;s telegraph was tested on a experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at Peterhof and the naval base at Kronstadt. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling&#x27;s death in 1837. Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the binary system of signal transmission. His work was taken over and developed by Moritz von Jacobi who invented telegraph equipment that was used by Tsar Alexander III to connect the Imperial palace at Tsarskoye Selo and Kronstadt Naval Base.
In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss, together with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber in Göttingen, installed a wire above the town&#x27;s roofs. Gauss combined the Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the galvanometer. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a commutator of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.

At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals and finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code that was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss&#x27;s laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the University of Göttingen, in Germany.

Gauss was convinced that this communication would be of help to his kingdom&#x27;s towns. Later in the same year, instead of a voltaic pile, Gauss used an induction pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university did not have the funds to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from Alexander von Humboldt. Carl August Steinheil in Munich was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835–1836. In 1838, Steinheil installed a telegraph along the Nuremberg–Fürth railway line, built in 1835 as the first German railroad, which was the first earth-return telegraph put into service.

By 1837, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone had co-developed a telegraph system which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet&#x27;s 26 letters.
Samuel Morse independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse&#x27;s assistant Alfred Vail developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet. Morse and Vail developed the Morse code signalling alphabet. 

On 24 May 1844, Morse sent to Vail the historic first message “WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT&quot; from the Capitol in Washington to the old Mt. Clare Depot in Baltimore.
== Commercial telegraphy ==
===Cooke and Wheatstone system===
The first commercial electrical telegraph was the Cooke and Wheatstone system. A demonstration four-needle system was installed on the Euston to Camden Town section of Robert Stephenson&#x27;s London and Birmingham Railway in 1837 for signalling rope-hauling of locomotives. It was rejected in favour of pneumatic whistles. Cooke and Wheatstone had their first commercial success with a system installed on the Great Western Railway over the from Paddington station to West Drayton in 1838. This was a five-needle, six-wire system, and had the major advantage of displaying the letter being sent so operators did not need to learn a code. The insulation failed on the underground cables between Paddington and West Drayton, and when the line was extended to Slough in 1843, the system was converted to a one-needle, two-wire configuration with uninsulated wires on poles. The cost of installing wires was ultimately more economically significant than the cost of training operators. The one-needle telegraph proved highly successful on British railways, and 15,000 sets were in use at the end of the nineteenth century; some remained in service in the 1930s. The Electric Telegraph Company, the world&#x27;s first public telegraphy company, was formed in 1845 by financier John Lewis Ricardo and Cooke.

===Wheatstone ABC telegraph===

Wheatstone developed a practical alphabetical system in 1840 called the A.B.C. System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a &quot;communicator&quot; at the sending end and an &quot;indicator&quot; at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a magneto actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would advance the pointers at both ends by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator&#x27;s pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator&#x27;s pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose armature was coupled to it through an escapement. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator&#x27;s pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.

===Morse system===

The Morse system uses a single wire between offices. At the sending station, an operator taps on a switch called a telegraph key, spelling out text messages in Morse code. Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.

In 1851, a conference in Vienna of countries in the German-Austrian Telegraph Union (which included many central European countries) adopted the Morse telegraph as the system for international communications. The international Morse code adopted was considerably modified from the original American Morse code, and was based on a code used on Hamburg railways (Gerke, 1848). A common code was a necessary step to allow direct telegraph connection between countries. With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message. In 1865, a conference in Paris adopted Gerke&#x27;s code as the International Morse code and was henceforth the international standard. The US, however, continued to use American Morse code internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.

In the United States, the Morse/Vail telegraph was quickly deployed in the two decades following the first demonstration in 1844. The overland telegraph connected the west coast of the continent to the east coast by 24 October 1861, bringing an end to the Pony Express.

===Foy–Breguet system===
France was slow to adopt the electrical telegraph, because of the extensive optical telegraph system built during the Napoleonic era. There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations. The Foy-Breguet telegraph was eventually adopted. This was a two-needle system using two signal wires but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs. The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators. The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completely until 1855. In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.

===Expansion===
As well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in post offices. The era of mass personal communication had begun. Telegraph networks were expensive to build, but financing was readily available, especially from London bankers. By 1852, National systems were in operation in major countries: 
The New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company, for example, was created in 1852 in Rochester, New York and eventually became the Western Union Telegraph Company. Although many countries had telegraph networks, there was no &quot;worldwide&quot; interconnection. Message by post was still the primary means of communication to countries outside Europe.

Telegraphy was introduced in Central Asia during the 1870s.

===Telegraphic improvements===

A continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate. There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of telegraphese.

The first system that did not require skilled technicians to operate was Charles Wheatstone&#x27;s ABC system in 1840 in which the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.

In 1846, Alexander Bain patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.

For a brief period, starting with the New York–Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a &quot;sounder&quot;, an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.

Royal Earl House developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver, and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852. Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators&#x27; errors. The House machine was used on four main American telegraph lines by 1852. The speed of the House machine was announced as 2600 words an hour.
David Edward Hughes invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.

The next improvement was the Baudot code of 1874. French engineer Émile Baudot patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.

By this point, reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission were still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone. The message (in Morse code) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the &#x27;Stick Punch&#x27;. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.

====Teleprinters====

An early successful teleprinter was invented by Frederick G. Creed. In Glasgow he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.

With the invention of the teletypewriter, telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 Baudot code, a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two &quot;shifts&quot;, &quot;letters&quot; and &quot;figures&quot;. An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot&#x27;s code was modified by Donald Murray.

In the 1930s, teleprinters were produced by Teletype in the US, Creed in Britain and Siemens in Germany.

By 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These resulting systems were called &quot;Telex&quot; (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for circuit switching, and then sent data by ITA2. This &quot;type A&quot; Telex routing functionally automated message routing.

The first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s as a network used to communicate within the government.

At the rate of 45.45 (±0.5%) baud – considered speedy at the time – up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using &quot;voice frequency telegraphy multiplexing&quot;, making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.

Automatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by CPR Telegraphs and CN Telegraph in July 1957 and in 1958, Western Union started to build a Telex network in the United States.

====The harmonic telegraph====
The most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation – the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the duplex and the quadruplex which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction. However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines. In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including Charles Bourseul, Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray, and Alexander Graham Bell.

One approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal. This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of frequency-division multiplexing. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.

With a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the invention of the telephone. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually, the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.)

===Oceanic telegraph cables===
Soon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of submarine communications cables was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the electric current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon William Montgomerie introduced gutta-percha, the adhesive juice of the &quot;Palaquium gutta&quot; tree, to Europe. Michael Faraday and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from Dover to Calais. Gutta-percha was used as insulation on a wire laid across the Rhine between Deutz and Cologne. In 1849, C. V. Walker, electrician to the South Eastern Railway, submerged a wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.

John Watkins Brett, an engineer from Bristol, sought and obtained permission from Louis-Philippe in 1847 to establish telegraphic communication between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.

The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in London in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, captained by Sir James Anderson, after many mishaps along the way. John Pender, one of the men on the Great Eastern, later founded several telecommunications companies primarily laying cables between Britain and Southeast Asia. Earlier transatlantic submarine cables installations were attempted in 1857, 1858 and 1865. The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long transmission lines. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870. (Those several companies combined to form the &quot;Eastern Telegraph Company&quot; in 1872.) The HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition in 1873–1876 mapped the ocean floor for future underwater telegraph cables.

Australia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin. This brought news reports from the rest of the world. The telegraph across the Pacific was completed in 1902, finally encircling the world.

From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line. In 1896, there were thirty cable laying ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world&#x27;s cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent.

===Cable and Wireless Company===
Cable &amp; Wireless was a British telecommunications company that traced its origins back to the 1860s, with Sir John Pender as the founder, although the name was only adopted in 1934. It was formed from successive mergers including: 
*The Falmouth, Malta, Gibraltar Telegraph Company
*The British Indian Submarine Telegraph Company
*The Marseilles, Algiers and Malta Telegraph Company
*The Eastern Telegraph Company
*The Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company
*The Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies

==Telegraphy and longitude==
Main article § Section: .

The telegraph was very important for sending time signals to determine longitude, providing greater accuracy than previously available. Longitude was measured by comparing local time (for example local noon occurs when the sun is at its highest above the horizon) with absolute time (a time that is the same for an observer anywhere on earth). If the local times of two places differ by one hour, the difference in longitude between them is 15° (360°/24h). Before telegraphy, absolute time could be obtained from astronomical events, such as eclipses, occultations or lunar distances, or by transporting an accurate clock (a chronometer) from one location to the other.

The idea of using the telegraph to transmit a time signal for longitude determination was suggested by François Arago to Samuel Morse in 1837, and the first test of this idea was made by Capt. Wilkes of the U.S. Navy in 1844, over Morse&#x27;s line between Washington and Baltimore. The method was soon in practical use for longitude determination, in particular by the U.S. Coast Survey, and over longer and longer distances as the telegraph network spread across North America and the world, and as technical developments improved accuracy and productivity

The &quot;telegraphic longitude net&quot; soon became worldwide. Transatlantic links between Europe and North America were established in 1866 and 1870. The US Navy extended observations into the West Indies and Central and South America with an additional transatlantic link from South America to Lisbon between 1874 and 1890. British, Russian and US observations created a chain from Europe through Suez, Aden, Madras, Singapore, China and Japan, to Vladivostok, thence to Saint Petersburg and back to Western Europe.

Australia&#x27;s telegraph network was linked to Singapore&#x27;s via Java in 1871, and the net circled the globe in 1902 with the connection of the Australia and New Zealand networks to Canada&#x27;s via the All Red Line. The two determinations of longitudes, one transmitted from east to west and the other from west to east, agreed within one second of arc ( second of time – less than 30 metres).

==Telegraphy in war==
The ability to send telegrams brought obvious advantages to those conducting war. Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were also geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables that improved security, however once radio telegraphy was developed interception became far more widespread.

===Crimean War===
The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts to use telegraphs and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the Royal Engineers. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers &amp; Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.

Journalistic recording of the war was provided by William Howard Russell (writing for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper) with photographs by Roger Fenton. News from war correspondents kept the public of the nations involved in the war informed of the day-to-day events in a way that had not been possible in any previous war. After the French extended their telegraph lines to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, war news began reaching London in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. These prompt daily news reports energised British public opinion on the war, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory. By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South&#x27;s much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth. Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city. It was not until the Civil War that the government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of Fort Sumter, the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.

Within 6 months of the start of the war, the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps (USMT) had laid approximately of line. By war&#x27;s end they had laid approximately of line, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.

Even before the war, the American Telegraph Company censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, Secretary of War Simon Cameron, and later Edwin Stanton, wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton&#x27;s first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at McClellan&#x27;s headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Stanton himself said &quot;[telegraphy] is my right arm&quot;. Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the Battle of Antietam (1862), the Battle of Chickamauga (1863), and Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea (1864).

The telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators did not have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they were not required to, so Albert Myer created a U.S. Army Signal Corps in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp&#x27;s new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT&#x27;s system.

===First World War===
During World War I, Britain&#x27;s telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany&#x27;s cables worldwide. The British government censored telegraph cable companies in an effort to root out espionage and restrict financial transactions with Central Powers nations. British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the Zimmermann Telegram incident that contributed to the US joining the war. Despite British acquisition of German colonies and expansion into the Middle East, debt from the war led to Britain&#x27;s control over telegraph cables to weaken while US control grew.

===Second World War===

World War II revived the &#x27;cable war&#x27; of 1914–1918. In 1939, German-owned cables across the Atlantic were cut once again, and, in 1940, Italian cables to South America and Spain were cut in retaliation for Italian action against two of the five British cables linking Gibraltar and Malta. Electra House, Cable &amp; Wireless&#x27;s head office and central cable station, was damaged by German bombing in 1941.

Resistance movements in occupied Europe sabotaged communications facilities such as telegraph lines, forcing the Germans to use wireless telegraphy, which could then be intercepted by Britain.
The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: &quot;Schlüssel-Zusatz&quot;, &quot;cipher attachment&quot;) that was used for enciphering telegrams, using the Lorenz cipher, between German High Command (OKW) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and decrypted a large amount of teleprinter traffic.

==End of the telegraph era==
In America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the National Bell Telephone Company. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union&#x27;s decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union&#x27;s upper management&#x27;s failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.

While the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph&#x27;s future and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining. AT&amp;T acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action. AT&amp;T bought Western Union&#x27;s electronic mail and Telex businesses in 1990.

Although commercial &quot;telegraph&quot; services are still available in many countries, transmission is usually done via a computer network rather than a dedicated wired connection.

<doc id="9454" wikidata="Q1361924" url="?curid=9454" title="Establishing shot">
<text>An establishing shot in filmmaking and television production sets up, or establishes, the context for a scene by showing the relationship between its important figures and objects. It is generally a long or extreme-long shot at the beginning of a scene indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place.

Establishing shots were more common during the classical era of filmmaking than they are now. Today&#x27;s filmmakers tend to skip the establishing shot in order to move the scene along more quickly, or merely mention the setting in on-screen text (as is done in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise). In addition, the expositional nature of the shot may be unsuitable to scenes in mysteries, where details are intentionally obscured or left out.

==Use of establishing shots==

;Location: Establishing shots may use famous landmarks to indicate the city where the action is taking place or has moved.

;Time of day: Sometimes the viewer is guided in their understanding of the action. For example, an exterior shot of a building at night followed by an interior shot of people talking implies that the conversation is taking place at night inside that building – the conversation may in fact have been filmed on a studio set far from the apparent location, because of budget, permits, time limitations or convenience. In the series &quot;JAG&quot;, 24-hour Coordinated Universal Time was used for these scenes to reinforce the military setting of the series.

;Relationship: An establishing shot might be a long shot of a room that shows all the characters from a particular scene. For example, a scene about a murder in a college lecture hall might begin with a shot that shows the entire room, including the lecturing professor and the students taking notes. A close-up shot can also be used at the beginning of a scene to establish the setting (such as, for the lecture hall scene, a shot of a pencil writing notes).

;Concept: An establishing shot may also establish a concept, rather than a location. For example, opening with a martial arts drill visually establishes the theme of martial arts. A shot of rain falling could be an establishing shot, followed by more and more detailed look at the rain, culminating with individual raindrops falling.

<text>Etruscan ( ) was the language of the Etruscan civilization in the ancient region of Etruria, in Etruria Padana and Etruria Campana in what is now Italy. Etruscan influenced Latin but was eventually superseded by it. The Etruscans left around 13,000 inscriptions that have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length; some bilingual inscriptions with texts also in Latin, Greek, or Phoenician; and a few dozen purported loanwords. Attested from 700 BC to AD 50, the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long-running speculation and study. Nowadays, it is generally agreed to be in the Tyrsenian language family, but before it gained currency as one of the Tyrsenian languages, it was commonly treated as an isolate, although there were also a number of other less well-known hypotheses.

The consensus among linguists and Etruscologists is that Etruscan was a Pre-Indo-European and Paleo-European language, closely related to the Raetic language that was spoken in the Alps, and to the Lemnian language, attested in a few inscriptions on Lemnos.

The Etruscan alphabet is similar to the Greek one. Therefore, linguists have been able to read the inscriptions in the sense of knowing roughly how they would have been pronounced, but have not yet understood their meaning. However, by using combinatory method, it was possible to assign some Etruscan words to grammatical categories such as noun and verb, to identify some inflectional endings, and to assign meanings to a few words of very frequent occurrence.

A comparison between the Etruscan and Greek alphabets reveals how accurately the Etruscans preserved the Greek alphabet. The Etruscan alphabet contains letters that have since been dropped from the Greek alphabet, such as the digamma, sampi and qoppa.

Grammatically, the language is agglutinating, with nouns and verbs showing suffixed inflectional endings and some gradation of vowels. Nouns show five cases, singular and plural numbers, with a gender distinction between animate and inanimate in pronouns.

Etruscan appears to have had a cross-linguistically common phonological system, with four phonemic vowels and an apparent contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops. The records of the language suggest that phonetic change took place over time, with the loss and then re-establishment of word-internal vowels, possibly due to the effect of Etruscan&#x27;s word-initial stress.

Etruscan religion was influenced by that of the Greeks, and many of the few surviving Etruscan-language artifacts are of votive or religious significance. Etruscan was written in an alphabet derived from the Greek alphabet; this alphabet was the source of the Latin alphabet, as well as other alphabets in Italy and probably beyond. The Etruscan language is also believed to be the source of certain important cultural words of Western Europe such as &quot;military&quot; and &quot;person&quot;, which do not have obvious Indo-European roots.

==History of Etruscan literacy==
Etruscan literacy was widespread over the Mediterranean shores, as evidenced by about 13,000 inscriptions (dedications, epitaphs, etc.), most fairly short, but some of considerable length. They date from about 700 BC.

The Etruscans had a rich literature, as noted by Latin authors. Livy and Cicero were both aware that highly specialized Etruscan religious rites were codified in several sets of books written in Etruscan under the generic Latin title . The dealt with divination by reading entrails from a sacrificed animal, while the expounded the art of divination by observing lightning. A third set, the , might have provided a key to Etruscan civilization: its wider scope embraced Etruscan standards of social and political life, as well as ritual practices. According to the 4th-century AD Latin writer Maurus Servius Honoratus, a fourth set of Etruscan books existed, dealing with animal gods, but it is unlikely that any scholar living in that era could have read Etruscan. However, only one book (as opposed to inscription), the &quot;Liber Linteus&quot;, survived, and only because the linen on which it was written was used as mummy wrappings.

By 30 BC, Livy noted that Etruscan was once widely taught to Roman boys, but had since become replaced by the teaching of Greek, while Varro noted that theatrical works had once been composed in Etruscan.

===Demise===

The date of extinction for Etruscan is held by scholarship to have been either in the late first century BC, or the early first century AD. Freeman&#x27;s analysis of inscriptional evidence implies that Etruscan was still flourishing in the 2nd century BC, still alive in the first century BC, and surviving in at least one location in the beginning of the first century AD; however, the replacement of Etruscan by Latin likely occurred earlier in southern regions closer to Rome.
In southern Etruria, the first Etruscan site to be Latinized was Veii, when it was destroyed and repopulated by Romans in 396 BC. Caere (Cerveteri), another southern Etruscan town on the coast 45 kilometers from Rome, appears to have shifted to Latin in the late 2nd century BC. In Tarquinia and Vulci, Latin inscriptions coexisted with Etruscan inscriptions in wall paintings and grave markers for centuries, from the 3rd century BC until the early 1st century BC, after which Etruscan is replaced by the exclusive use of Latin.

In northern Etruria, Etruscan inscriptions continue after they disappear in southern Etruria. At Clusium (Chiusi), tomb markings show mixed Latin and Etruscan in the first half of the 1st century BC, with cases where two subsequent generations are inscribed in Latin and then the third, youngest generation, surprisingly, is transcribed in Etruscan. At Perugia, monolingual monumental inscriptions in Etruscan are still seen in the first half of the 1st century BC, while the period of bilingual inscriptions appears to have stretched from the 3rd century to the late 1st century BC. The isolated last bilinguals are found at three northern sites. Inscriptions in Arezzo include one dated to 40 BC followed by two with slightly later dates, while in Volterra there is one dated to just after 40 BC and a final one dated to 10–20 AD; coins with written Etruscan near Saena have also been dated to 15 BC. Freeman notes that in rural areas the language may have survived a bit longer, and that a survival into the late 1st century AD and beyond &quot;cannot wholly be dismissed&quot;, especially given the revelation of Oscan writing in Pompeii&#x27;s walls.

Despite the apparent extinction of Etruscan, it appears that Etruscan religious rites continued much later, continuing to use the Etruscan names of deities and possibly with some liturgical usage of the language. In late Republican and early Augustan times, various Latin sources including Cicero noted the esteemed reputation of Etruscan soothsayers. An episode where lightning struck an inscription with the name Caesar, turning it into Aesar, was interpreted to have been a premonition of the deification of Caesar because of the resemblance to Etruscan , meaning &#x27;gods&#x27;, although this indicates knowledge of a single word and not the language. Centuries later and long after Etruscan is thought to have died out, Ammianus Marcellinus reports that Julian the Apostate, the last pagan Emperor, apparently had Etruscan soothsayers accompany him on his military campaigns with books on war, lightning and celestial events, but the language of these books is unknown. According to Zosimus, when Rome was faced with destruction by Alaric in 408 AD, the protection of nearby Etruscan towns was attributed to Etruscan pagan priests who claimed to have summoned a raging thunderstorm, and they offered their services &quot;in the ancestral manner&quot; to Rome as well, but the devout Christians of Rome refused the offer, preferring death to help by pagans. Freeman notes that these events may indicate that a limited theological knowledge of Etruscan may have survived among the priestly caste much longer. One 19th-century writer argued in 1892 that Etruscan deities retained an influence on early modern Tuscan folklore.

Around 180 AD, the Latin author Aulus Gellius mentions Etruscan alongside the Gaulish language in an anecdote. Freeman notes that although Gaulish was clearly still alive during Gellius&#x27; time, his testimony may not indicate that Etruscan was still alive because the phrase could indicate a meaning of the sort of &quot;it&#x27;s all Greek (incomprehensible) to me&quot;.

At the time of its extinction, only a few educated Romans with antiquarian interests, such as Marcus Terentius Varro, could read Etruscan. The Roman emperor Claudius (10 BC – AD 54) is considered to have possibly been able to read Etruscan, and authored the Tyrrhenika, a (now lost) treatise on Etruscan history; a separate dedication made by Claudius implies a knowledge from &quot;diverse Etruscan sources&quot;, but it is unclear if any were fluent speakers of Etruscan. Plautia Urgulanilla, the emperor&#x27;s first wife, had Etruscan roots.

Etruscan had some influence on Latin, as a few dozen Etruscan words and names were borrowed by the Romans, some of which remain in modern languages, among which are possibly &#x27;vulture&#x27;, &#x27;trumpet&#x27;, &#x27;sheath&#x27;, &#x27;people&#x27;.

==Geographic distribution==
Inscriptions have been found in northwest and west-central Italy, in the region that even now bears the name of the Etruscan civilization, Tuscany (from Latin &#x27;Etruscans&#x27;), as well as in modern Latium north of Rome, in today&#x27;s Umbria west of the Tiber, in the Po Valley to the north of Etruria, and in Campania. This range may indicate a maximum Italian homeland where the language was at one time spoken.

Outside Italy, inscriptions have been found in Corsica, Gallia Narbonensis, Greece, the Balkans. But by far the greatest concentration is in Italy.

==Classification==
===Tyrsenian family hypothesis===
In 1998, Helmut Rix put forward the view that Etruscan is related to other extinct languages such as Raetic, spoken in ancient times in the eastern Alps, and Lemnian, to which other scholars added Camunic language, spoken in the Central Alps.
Rix&#x27;s Tyrsenian language family has gained widespread acceptance among scholars, being confirmed by Stefan Schumacher, Norbert Oettinger, Carlo De Simone, and Simona Marchesini.

Common features between Etruscan, Raetic, and Lemnian have been found in morphology, phonology, and syntax, but only a few lexical correspondences are documented, at least partly due to the scant number of Raetic and Lemnian texts. On the other hand, the Tyrsenian family, or Common Tyrrhenic, is often considered to be Paleo-European and to predate the arrival of Indo-European languages in southern Europe. Several scholars believe that the Lemnian language could have arrived in the Aegean Sea during the Late Bronze Age, when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from Sicily, Sardinia and various parts of the Italian peninsula. Scholars such as Norbert Oettinger, Michel Gras and Carlo De Simone think that Lemnian is the testimony of an Etruscan commercial settlement on the island that took place before 700 BC, not related to the Sea Peoples.

==== Archeogenetic studies ====
A 2021 archeogenetic analysis of Etruscan individuals, who lived between 800 BC and 1 BC, concluded that the Etruscans were autochthonous and genetically similar to the Early Iron Age Latins, and that the Etruscan language, and therefore the other languages of the Tyrrhenian family, may be a surviving language of the ones that were widespread in Europe from at least the Neolithic period before the arrival of the Indo-European languages, as already argued by German geneticist Johannes Krause who concluded that it is likely that the Etruscan language (as well as Basque, Paleo-Sardinian and Minoan) &quot;developed on the continent in the course of the Neolithic Revolution&quot;. The lack of recent Anatolian-related admixture and Iranian-related ancestry among the Etruscans, who genetically joined firmly to the European cluster, might also suggest that the presence of a handful of inscriptions found at Lemnos, in a language related to Etruscan and Raetic, &quot;could represent population movements departing from the Italian peninsula&quot;.

=== Superseded theories and fringe scholarship ===
For many hundreds of years the classification of Etruscan remained problematic for historical linguists, though it was almost universally agreed upon that Etruscan was a language unlike any other in Europe. Before it gained currency as one of the Tyrrhenian languages, Etruscan was commonly treated as a language isolate. Over the centuries many hypotheses on the Etruscan language have been developed, most of which have not been accepted or have been considered highly speculative since they were published. The major consensus among scholars is that Etruscan, and therefore all the languages of the Tyrrhenian family, is neither Indo-European nor Semitic, and may be a Pre–Indo-European and Paleo-European language. At present the major consensus is that Etruscan&#x27;s only kinship is with the Raetic and Lemnian languages.

==== Pre-Greek substrate hypothesis ====
The idea of a relation between the language of the Minoan Linear A scripts was taken into consideration as the main hypothesis by Michael Ventris before he discovered that, in fact, the language behind the later Linear B script was Mycenean, a Greek dialect. It has been proposed to possibly be part of a wider Paleo-European &quot;Aegean&quot; language family, which would also include Minoan, Eteocretan (possibly descended from Minoan) and Eteocypriot. This has been proposed by Giulio Mauro Facchetti, a researcher who has dealt with both Etruscan and Minoan, and supported by S. Yatsemirsky, referring to some similarities between Etruscan and Lemnian on one hand, and Minoan and Eteocretan on the other.
It has also been proposed that this language family is related to the pre-Indo-European languages of Anatolia, based upon place name analysis. The relationship between Etruscan and Minoan, and hypothetical unattested pre-Indo-European languages of Anatolia, is considered unfounded.

==== Anatolian Indo-European family hypothesis ====
Some have suggested that Tyrsenian languages may yet be distantly related to early Indo-European languages, such as those of the Anatolian branch. More recently, Robert S. P. Beekes argued in 2002 that the people later known as the Lydians and Etruscans had originally lived in northwest Anatolia, with a coastline to the Sea of Marmara, whence they were driven by the Phrygians &quot;circa&quot; 1200 BC, leaving a remnant known in antiquity as the Tyrsenoi. A segment of this people moved south-west to Lydia, becoming known as the Lydians, while others sailed away to take refuge in Italy, where they became known as Etruscans. This account draws on the well-known story by Herodotus (I, 94) of the Lydian origin of the Etruscans or Tyrrhenians, famously rejected by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (book I), partly on the authority of Xanthus, a Lydian historian, who had no knowledge of the story, and partly on what he judged to be the different languages, laws, and religions of the two peoples. In 2006, Frederik Woudhuizen went further on Herodotus&#x27; traces, suggesting that Etruscan belongs to the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European family, specifically to Luwian. Woudhuizen revived a conjecture to the effect that the Tyrsenians came from Anatolia, including Lydia, whence they were driven by the Cimmerians in the early Iron Age, 750–675 BC, leaving some colonists on Lemnos. He makes a number of comparisons of Etruscan to Luwian and asserts that Etruscan is modified Luwian. He accounts for the non-Luwian features as a Mysian influence: &quot;deviations from Luwian [...] may plausibly be ascribed to the dialect of the indigenous population of Mysia.&quot; According to Woudhuizen, the Etruscans were initially colonizing the Latins, bringing the alphabet from Anatolia. For historical, archaeological, genetic, and linguistic reasons, a relationship between Etruscan and the Indo-European Anatolian languages (Lydian or Luwian) and the idea that the Etruscans initially colonized the Latins, bringing the alphabet from Anatolia, have not been accepted, since the account by Herodotus is no longer considered reliable.

==== Other theories ====
The interest in Etruscan antiquities and the Etruscan language found its modern origin in a book by a Renaissance Dominican friar, Annio da Viterbo, a cabalist and orientalist now remembered mainly for literary forgeries. In 1498, Annio published his antiquarian miscellany titled (in 17 volumes) where he put together a theory in which both the Hebrew and Etruscan languages were said to originate from a single source, the &quot;Aramaic&quot; spoken by Noah and his descendants, founders of the Etruscan city Viterbo.

The 19th century saw numerous attempts to reclassify Etruscan. Ideas of Semitic origins found supporters until this time. In 1858, the last attempt was made by Johann Gustav Stickel, Jena University in his . A reviewer concluded that Stickel brought forward every possible argument which would speak for that hypothesis, but he proved the opposite of what he had attempted to do. In 1861, Robert Ellis proposed that Etruscan was related to Armenian. Exactly 100 years later, a relationship with Albanian was to be advanced by Zecharia Mayani, a theory regarded today as disproven and discredited.

Several theories from the late 19th and early 20th centuries connected Etruscan to Uralic or even Altaic languages. In 1874, the British scholar Isaac Taylor brought up the idea of a genetic relationship between Etruscan and Hungarian, of which also Jules Martha would approve in his exhaustive study (1913). In 1911, the French orientalist Baron Carra de Vaux suggested a connection between Etruscan and the Altaic languages. The Hungarian connection was revived by Mario Alinei, emeritus professor of Italian languages at the University of Utrecht. Alinei&#x27;s proposal has been rejected by Etruscan experts such as Giulio M. Facchetti, Finno-Ugric experts such as Angela Marcantonio, and by Hungarian historical linguists such as Bela Brogyanyi. Another proposal, pursued mainly by a few linguists from the former Soviet Union, suggested a relationship with Northeast Caucasian (or Nakh-Daghestanian) languages. None of these theories has been accepted nor enjoys consensus.

==Writing system==
===Alphabet===
The Latin script owes its existence to the Etruscan alphabet, which was adapted for Latin in the form of the Old Italic script. The Etruscan alphabet employs a Euboean variant of the Greek alphabet using the letter digamma and was in all probability transmitted through Pithecusae and Cumae, two Euboean settlements in southern Italy. This system is ultimately derived from West Semitic scripts.

The Etruscans recognized a 26-letter alphabet, which makes an early appearance incised for decoration on a small bucchero terracotta lidded vase in the shape of a cockerel at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ca. 650–600 BC. The full complement of 26 has been termed the model alphabet. The Etruscans did not use four letters of it, mainly because Etruscan did not have the voiced stops &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot;; the &quot;o&quot; was also not used. They innovated one letter for &quot;f&quot; ().

===Text===
Writing was from right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which occasionally used boustrophedon. An example found at Cerveteri used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, the words are continuous. From the 6th century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is sometimes difficult. Spelling might vary from city to city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.

===Complex consonant clusters===
Speech featured a heavy stress on the first syllable of a word, causing syncopation by weakening of the remaining vowels, which then were not represented in writing: &quot;Alcsntre&quot; for &quot;Alexandros&quot;, &quot;Rasna&quot; for &quot;Rasena&quot;. This speech habit is one explanation of the Etruscan &quot;impossible&quot; consonant clusters. Some of the consonants, especially resonants, however, may have been syllabic, accounting for some of the clusters (see below under Consonants). In other cases, the scribe sometimes inserted a vowel: Greek &quot;Hēraklēs&quot; became &quot;Hercle&quot; by syncopation and then was expanded to &quot;Herecele&quot;. Pallottino regarded this variation in vowels as &quot;instability in the quality of vowels&quot; and accounted for the second phase (e.g. &quot;Herecele&quot;) as &quot;vowel harmony, i.e., of the assimilation of vowels in neighboring syllables&quot;.

===Phases===
The writing system had two historical phases: the archaic from the seventh to fifth centuries BC, which used the early Greek alphabet, and the later from the fourth to first centuries BC, which modified some of the letters. In the later period, syncopation increased.

The alphabet went on in modified form after the language disappeared. In addition to being the source of the Roman and early Oscan and Umbrian alphabets, it has been suggested that it passed northward into Veneto and from there through Raetia into the Germanic lands, where it became the Elder Futhark alphabet, the oldest form of the runes.

==Epigraphy==
The corpus of Etruscan inscriptions is edited in the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum&quot; (CIE) and &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Etruscae&quot; (TLE).

===Bilingual text===

The Pyrgi Tablets are a bilingual text in Etruscan and Phoenician engraved on three gold leaves, one for the Phoenician and two for the Etruscan. The Etruscan language portion has 16 lines and 37 words. The date is roughly 500 BC.

The tablets were found in 1964 by Massimo Pallottino during an excavation at the ancient Etruscan port of Pyrgi, now Santa Severa. The only new Etruscan word that could be extracted from close analysis of the tablets was the word for &#x27;three&#x27;, .

===Longer texts===
According to Rix and his collaborators, only two unified (though fragmentary) long texts are available in Etruscan:
* The &quot;Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis&quot;, which was later used for mummy wrappings in Egypt. Roughly 1,200 words of readable (but not fully translatable) text, mainly repetitious prayers probably comprising a kind of religious calendar, yielded about 50 lexical items.
* The &quot;Tabula Capuana&quot; (the inscribed tile from Capua) has about 300 readable words in 62 lines, dating to the fifth century BC. It again seems to be a religious calendar.

Some additional longer texts are:

* The inscription of 59 words on the Sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas, also known as The Magistrate, dating from the third century BC, discovered in Tarquinia, now residing in Museo Nazionale Archeologico (Tarquinia, Viterbo, Lazio, Italy).
* The lead foils of Punta della Vipera have about 40 legible words having to do with ritual formulae. It is dated to about 500 BC.
* The Cippus Perusinus, a stone slab (cippus) found at Perugia, which probably functioned as a border marker, contains 46 lines and about 130 words. The cippus is assumed to be a text dedicating a legal contract between the Etruscan families of Velthina (from Perugia) and Afuna (from Chiusi), regarding the sharing or use of a property, including water rights, upon which there was a tomb belonging to the noble Velthinas.
* The Piacenza Liver, a bronze model of a sheep&#x27;s liver representing the sky, has the engraved names of the gods ruling different sections.
* The Tabula Cortonensis, a bronze tablet from Cortona, is believed to record a legal contract between Cusu family and Petru Scevas and his wife concerning a real estate settlement of some sort, with about 200 words. Discovered in 1992, this new tablet contributed the word for &#x27;lake&#x27;, , but not much else.
* The Vicchio stele, found in the 21st season of excavation at the Etruscan Sanctuary at Poggio Colla, is believed to be connected with the cult of the goddess Uni, with about 120 letters. Only discovered in 2016, it is still in the process of being deciphered. As an example of difficulties in reading this badly damaged monument, here is Maggiani&#x27;s attempt at a transliteration and translation of a bit from the beginning of the third block of text (III, 1–3): (vacat) tinaś: θ(?)anuri: unial(?)/ ẹ ṿ ị: zal / ame (akil??) &quot;for Tinia in the xxxx of Uni/xxxx(objects) two / must (akil ?) be...&quot;
* The badly damaged Saint Marinella lead sheet contains traces of 80 words, only half of which can be completely read with certainty, many of which can also be found in the Liber Linteus. It was discovered during the 1963-1964 excavations at a sanctuary near Saint Marinella near Pyrgi, now in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome.
* The Lead Plaque of Magliano contains 73 words, including many names of deities. It seems to be a series of dedications to various gods and ancestors.

===Inscriptions on monuments===
The main material repository of Etruscan civilization, from the modern perspective, is its tombs, all other public and private buildings having been dismantled and the stone reused centuries ago. The tombs are the main source of Etruscan portables, provenance unknown, in collections throughout the world. Their incalculable value has created a brisk black market in Etruscan &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; – and equally brisk law enforcement effort, as it is illegal to remove any objects from Etruscan tombs without authorization from the Italian government.

The magnitude of the task involved in cataloguing them means that the total number of tombs is unknown. They are of many types. Especially plentiful are the hypogeal or &quot;underground&quot; chambers or system of chambers cut into tuff and covered by a tumulus. The interior of these tombs represents a habitation of the living stocked with furniture and favorite objects. The walls may display painted murals, the predecessor of wallpaper. Tombs identified as Etruscan date from the Villanovan period to about 100 BC, when presumably the cemeteries were abandoned in favor of Roman ones. Some of the major cemeteries are as follows:
* Caere or Cerveteri, a UNESCO site. Three complete necropoleis with streets and squares. Many hypogea are concealed beneath tumuli retained by walls; others are cut into cliffs. The Banditaccia necropolis contains more than 1,000 tumuli. Access is through a door.

* Tarquinia, Tarquinii or Corneto, a UNESCO site: Approximately 6,000 graves dating from the Villanovan (ninth and eighth centuries BC) distributed in &quot;necropoleis&quot;, the main one being the Monterozzi hypogea of the sixth–fourth centuries BC. About 200 painted tombs display murals of various scenes with call-outs and descriptions in Etruscan. Elaborately carved sarcophagi of marble, alabaster, and nenfro include identificatory and achievemental inscriptions. The Tomb of Orcus at the Scatolini necropolis depicts scenes of the Spurinna family with call-outs.
* Inner walls and doors of tombs and sarcophagi, including the Golini Tomb and the Tomb of Orcus
* The Orator is a bronze statue with a dedicatory inscription of about 13 words in Etruscan
* Engraved steles (tombstones)
* ossuaries

===Inscriptions on portable objects===

====Votives====
One example of an early (pre-fifth century BC) votive inscription is on a bucchero oinochoe (wine vase): &quot;ṃiṇi mulvaṇịce venalia ṡlarinaṡ. en mipi kapi ṃi(r) ṇuṇai&quot; = &quot;Venalia Ṡlarinaṡ gave me. Do not touch me (?), I (am) &quot;nunai&quot; (an offering?).&quot; This seems to be a rare case from this early period of a female (Venalia) dedicating the votive.

====Mirrors====

A &quot;speculum&quot; is a circular or oval hand-mirror used predominantly by Etruscan women. is Latin; the Etruscan word is or . Specula were cast in bronze as one piece or with a tang into which a wooden, bone, or ivory handle fitted. The reflecting surface was created by polishing the flat side. A higher percentage of tin in the mirror improved its ability to reflect. The other side was convex and featured intaglio or cameo scenes from mythology. The piece was generally ornate.

About 2,300 specula are known from collections all over the world. As they were popular plunderables, the provenance of only a minority is known. An estimated time window is 530–100 BC. Most probably came from tombs.

Many bear inscriptions naming the persons depicted in the scenes, so they are often called picture bilinguals. In 1979, Massimo Pallottino, then president of the &quot;Istituto di Studi Etruschi ed Italici&quot; initiated the Committee of the &quot;Corpus Speculorum Etruscanorum&quot;, which resolved to publish all the specula and set editorial standards for doing so. Since then, the committee has grown, acquiring local committees and representatives from most institutions owning Etruscan mirror collections. Each collection is published in its own fascicle by diverse Etruscan scholars.

====Cistae====
A cista is a bronze container of circular, ovoid, or more rarely rectangular shape used by women for the storage of sundries. They are ornate, often with feet and lids to which figurines may be attached. The internal and external surfaces bear carefully crafted scenes usually from mythology, usually intaglio, or rarely part intaglio, part cameo.

Cistae date from the Roman Republic of the fourth and third centuries BC in Etruscan contexts. They may bear various short inscriptions concerning the manufacturer or owner or subject matter. The writing may be Latin, Etruscan, or both. Excavations at Praeneste, an Etruscan city which became Roman, turned up about 118 cistae, one of which has been termed &quot;the Praeneste cista&quot; or &quot;the Ficoroni cista&quot; by art analysts, with special reference to the one manufactured by Novios Plutius and given by Dindia Macolnia to her daughter, as the archaic Latin inscription says. All of them are more accurately termed &quot;the Praenestine cistae&quot;.

====Rings and ringstones====
Among the most plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of Etruria are the finely engraved gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended to go on finger rings. Around one centimeter in size, they are dated to the Etruscan apogee from the second half of the sixth to the first centuries BC. The two main theories of manufacture are native Etruscan and Greek. The materials are mainly dark red carnelian, with agate and sard entering usage from the third to the first centuries BC, along with purely gold finger rings with a hollow engraved bezel setting. The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict scarabs at first and then scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of the bezel bears a border design, such as cabling.

====Coins====
Etruscan-minted coins can be dated between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC. Use of the &#x27;Chalcidian&#x27; standard, based on the silver unit of 5.8 grams, indicates that this custom, like the alphabet, came from Greece. Roman coinage later supplanted Etruscan, but the basic Roman coin, the &quot;sesterce&quot;, is believed to have been based on the 2.5-denomination Etruscan coin. Etruscan coins have turned up in caches or individually in tombs and in excavations seemingly at random, and concentrated, of course, in Etruria.

Etruscan coins were in gold, silver, and bronze, the gold and silver usually having been struck on one side only. The coins often bore a denomination, sometimes a minting authority name, and a cameo motif. Gold denominations were in units of silver; silver, in units of bronze. Full or abbreviated names are mainly Pupluna (Populonia), Vatl or Veltuna (Vetulonia), Velathri (Volaterrae), Velzu or Velznani (Volsinii) and Cha for Chamars (Camars). Insignia are mainly heads of mythological characters or depictions of mythological beasts arranged in a symbolic motif: Apollo, Zeus, Culsans, Athena, Hermes, griffin, gorgon, male sphinx, hippocamp, bull, snake, eagle, or other creatures which had symbolic significance.

===Functional categories===
Wallace et al. include the following categories, based on the uses to which they were put, on their site: abecedaria (alphabets), artisans&#x27; texts, boundary markers, construction texts, dedications, didaskalia (instructional texts), funerary texts, legal texts, other/unclear texts, prohibitions, proprietary texts (indicating ownership), religious texts, tesserae hospitales (tokens that establish &quot;the claim of the bearer to hospitality when travelling&quot;).

==Phonology==
In the tables below, conventional letters used for transliterating Etruscan are accompanied by likely pronunciation in symbols within the square brackets, followed by examples of the early Etruscan alphabet which would have corresponded to these sounds.

===Vowels===
The Etruscan vowel system consisted of four distinct vowels. The vowels &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; appear to have not been phonetically distinguished based on the nature of the writing system, as only one symbol is used to cover both in loans from Greek (e.g. Greek &gt; Etruscan &#x27;pitcher&#x27;).

Before the front vowels is used, while and are used before respectively unrounded and rounded back vowels.

===Consonants===

====Table of consonants====
Etruscan also might have had consonants ʧ and ʧʰ, as they might be represented in the writing by using two letters, like in the word (&#x27;great-nephew&#x27; or &#x27;great-grandson&#x27;). However, this theory is not widely accepted.

====Absence of voiced stops====
The Etruscan consonant system primarily distinguished between aspirated and non-aspirated stops. There were no voiced stops. When words from foreign languages were borrowed into Etruscan, voiced stops typically became unvoiced stops; one example is Greek , which became Etruscan and Latin . Such a lack of voiced stops is not particularly unusual; it is found e.g. in modern Icelandic, in Scottish Gaelic, and in most Chinese languages. Even in English, aspiration is often more important than voice in the distinction of fortis-lenis pairs.

====Syllabic theory====
Based on standard spellings by Etruscan scribes of words without vowels or with unlikely consonant clusters (e.g. &#x27;of this (gen.)&#x27; and &#x27;freeman&#x27;), it is likely that were sometimes syllabic sonorants (cf. English &quot;little, &quot;button). Thus and .

Rix postulates several syllabic consonants, namely and palatal as well as a labiovelar fricative , and some scholars such as Mauro Cristofani also view the aspirates as palatal rather than aspirated but these views are not shared by most Etruscologists. Rix supports his theories by means of variant spellings such as &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/&quot;.

==Morphology/Grammar==
Etruscan was an agglutinative language, varying the endings of nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs with discrete endings for each function. It also had adverbs and conjunctions, whose endings did not vary.

===Nouns===
Etruscan substantives had five cases—nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and locative—and two numbers: singular and a plural. Not all five cases are attested for every word. Nouns merge the nominative and accusative; pronouns do not generally merge these. Gender appears in personal names (masculine and feminine) and in pronouns (animate and inanimate); otherwise, it is not marked.

Unlike the Indo-European languages, Etruscan noun endings were more agglutinative, with some nouns bearing two or three agglutinated suffixes. For example, where Latin would have distinct nominative plural and dative plural endings, Etruscan would suffix the case ending to a plural marker: Latin nominative singular , &#x27;son&#x27;, plural , dative plural , but Etruscan , and . Moreover, Etruscan nouns could bear multiple suffixes from the case paradigm alone: that is, Etruscan exhibited &quot;Suffixaufnahme&quot;. Pallottino calls this phenomenon &quot;morphological redetermination&quot;, which he defines as &quot;the typical tendency ... to redetermine the syntactical function of the form by the superposition of suffixes.&quot; His example is , &#x27;in the sanctuary of Juno&#x27;, where&quot; -al&quot; is a genitive ending and &quot;-θi&quot; a locative.

Steinbauer says of Etruscan, &quot;there can be more than one marker ... to design a case, and ... the same marker can occur for more than one case.&quot;

; Nominative/accusative case : No distinction is made between nominative and accusative of nouns. The nominative/accusative could act as the subject of transitive and intransitive verbs, but also as the object of transitive verbs, and it was also used to indicate duration of time (e.g., &#x27;for three years&#x27;).

: Common nouns use the unmarked root. Names of males may end in &quot;-e&quot;: (Hercules), (Achilles), (Titus); of females, in &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, or &quot;-u&quot;: (Juno), (Minerva), or . Names of gods may end in &quot;-s&quot;: &quot;,&quot; ; or they may be the unmarked stem ending in a vowel or consonant: (Apollo), (Bacchus), or .
; Genitive case : The genitive case had two main functions in Etruscan: the usual meaning of possession (along with other forms of dependency such as family relations), and it could also mark the recipient (indirect object) in votive inscriptions. 
: Pallottino defines two declensions based on whether the genitive ends in &quot;-s/-ś&quot; or &quot;-l&quot;. In the &quot;-s&quot; group are most noun stems ending in a vowel or a consonant: &quot;/&#x27;,&quot; &quot;/&quot;. In the second are names of females ending in &quot;i&quot; and names of males that end in &quot;s&quot;, &quot;th&quot; or &quot;n&quot;: &quot;/&#x27;,&quot; &quot;/&quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;/&quot;. After &quot;l&quot; or &quot;r&quot; &quot;-us&quot; instead of &quot;-s&quot; appears: &quot;/&quot;. Otherwise, a vowel might be placed before the ending: instead of . 
:According to Rex Wallace, &quot;A few nouns could be inflected with both types of endings without any difference in meaning. Consider, for example, the genitives &#x27;fortress (?)&#x27; and . Why this should be the case is not clear.&quot;
: There is a patronymic ending: &quot;-sa&quot; or &quot;-isa&quot;, &#x27;son of&#x27;, but the ordinary genitive might serve that purpose. In the genitive case, morphological redetermination becomes elaborate. Given two male names, &quot;Vel&quot; and &quot;Avle&quot;, means &#x27;Vel son of Avle&#x27;. This expression in the genitive become &quot;Vel-uś Avles-la&quot;. Pallottino&#x27;s example of a three-suffix form is .
; Dative case : Besides the usual function as indirect object (&#x27;to/for&#x27;), this case could be used as the agent (&#x27;by&#x27;) in passive clauses, and occasionally as a locative. The dative ending is &quot;-si&quot;: &quot;/&quot;. (Wallace uses the term &#x27;pertinentive&#x27; for this case.)
; Locative case : The locative ending is -θi: &quot;/&quot;.
; Plural number : Nouns semantically [+human] had the plural marking &quot;-ar&quot; : , &#x27;son&#x27;, as , &#x27;sons&#x27;. This shows both umlaut and an ending &quot;-ar&quot;. Plurals for cases other than nominative are made by agglutinating the case ending on . Nouns semantically [-human] used the plural &quot;-chve&quot; or one of its variants: &quot;-cva&quot; or &quot;-va&quot;: &#x27;year&#x27;, &#x27;years&#x27;; &#x27; (pig?)‐offering&#x27;, &quot;&#x27;zusle&quot;‐offerings&#x27;.

===Pronouns===
Personal pronouns refer to persons; demonstrative pronouns point out English &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, &quot;there&quot;.

====Personal====
The first-person personal pronoun has a nominative (&#x27;I&#x27;) and an accusative (&#x27;me&#x27;). The third person has a personal form (&#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27;) and an inanimate (&#x27;it&#x27;). The second person is uncertain but some scholars, such as the Bonfantes, have claimed a dative singular (&#x27;to thee&#x27;) and an accusative singular (&#x27;thee&#x27;).

====Demonstrative====
The demonstratives, and , are used without distinction for &#x27;that&#x27; or &#x27;this&#x27;. The nominative–accusative singular forms are: &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; ; the plural: &quot;,&quot; . There is a genitive singular: &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; and plural . The accusative singular: &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;,&quot; ; plural &#x27;these/those&#x27;. Locative singular: ; plural .

===Adjectives===
Though uninflected for number, adjectives were inflected for case, agreeing with their noun: &#x27;good&#x27; versus genitive &#x27;of (the) good...&#x27;

Adjectives fall into a number of types formed from nouns with a suffix:
* quality, -&quot;u, -iu&quot; or -&quot;c&quot;: , &#x27;god/divine&#x27;; , &#x27;gold/golden&#x27;
* possession or reference, -&quot;na, -ne, -ni:&quot; , &#x27;Bacchus, Bacchic&#x27;; , &#x27;family/familiar&#x27; (in the sense of servant)
* collective, -&quot;cva, -chva, -cve, -χve, -ia&quot;: : &#x27;figure/figured&#x27;; , &#x27;slave/servile&#x27;

===Adverbs===
Adverbs are unmarked: , &#x27;again&#x27;; , &#x27;now, here&#x27;; , &#x27;at first&#x27; (compare &#x27;one&#x27;). Most Indo-European adverbs are formed from the oblique cases, which become unproductive and descend to fixed forms. Cases such as the ablative are therefore called adverbial. If there is any such widespread system in Etruscan, it is not obvious from the relatively few surviving adverbs.

The negative adverb is (for examples, see below in Imperative moods) .

===Conjunctions===
The two enclitic coordinate conjunctions &quot;‐ka/‐ca/‐c&quot; &#x27;and&#x27; and &quot;-um/‐m&quot; &#x27;and, but&#x27; coordinated phrases and clauses, but phrases could also be coordinated without any conjunction (asyndetic).

===Verbs===
Verbs had an indicative mood, an imperative mood and others. Tenses were present and past. The past tense had an active voice and a passive voice.

====Present active====
Etruscan used a verbal root with a zero suffix or &quot;-a&quot; without distinction to number or person: &quot;,&quot; , &#x27;he, she, we, you, they make&#x27;.

====Past or preterite active====
Adding the suffix to the verb root produces a third-person singular active, which has been called variously a &quot;past&quot;, a &quot;preterite&quot;, a &quot;perfect.&quot; In contrast to Indo-European, this form is not marked for person. Examples: &#x27;gives, dedicates&#x27; versus &#x27;gave, dedicated&#x27;; &#x27;lives&#x27; versus &#x27;lived&#x27;.

====Past passive====
The third-person past passive is formed with -che: , &#x27;offers/offered/was offered&#x27;.

====Imperative mood====

The imperative was formed with the simple, uninflected root of the verb: &#x27;dedicate!&#x27;, &#x27;put!&#x27;, &#x27;speak!&#x27; and &#x27;invoke!&#x27;).

The imperative &#x27;take, steal&#x27; is found in anti‐theft inscriptions:

:: (Cm 2.13; fifth century BC)
::&#x27;I (am) the bowl of Cupe Althr̥na. Don’t steal me!&#x27;

====Other modals====

Verbs with the suffix &quot;‐a&quot; indicated the jussive mood, with the force of commanding, or exhorting (within a subjunctive framework).
::&#x27;No one should put/make (?) anything here ().&#x27;

Verbs ending in &quot;‐ri&quot; referred to obligatory activities:
::&#x27;On September twenty six, victims must be offered (?) and sacrificed (?) to Nethuns.&#x27;

====Participles====
Verbs formed participles in a variety of ways, among the most frequently attested being &quot;-u&quot; in &#x27;dead&#x27; from &#x27;die&#x27;.

Participles could also be formed with &quot;‐θ&quot;. These referred to activities that were contemporaneous with that of the main verb: &#x27;(while) speaking&#x27;, &#x27;(while) invoking&#x27;, and &#x27;(while) pouring (?)&#x27;.

===Postpositions===

Typical of SOV agglutinative languages, Etruscan had postpositions rather than prepositions, each governing a specific case.

===Syntax===
Etruscan is considered to have been a SOV language with postpositions, but the word order was not strict and the orders OVS and OSV are, in fact, more frequent in commemorative inscriptions from the archaic period, presumably as a stylistic feature of the genre. Adjectives were usually placed after the noun.

==Vocabulary==
===Borrowings from and to Etruscan===
Only a few hundred words of the Etruscan vocabulary are understood with some certainty. The exact count depends on whether the different forms and the expressions are included. Below is a table of some of the words grouped by topic.

Some words with corresponding Latin or other Indo-European forms are likely loanwords to or from Etruscan. For example, &#x27;nephew&#x27;, is probably from Latin (Latin &quot;,&quot; ; this is a cognate of German , Old Norse ). A number of for which Etruscan origin has been proposed survive in Latin.

At least one Etruscan word has an apparent Semitic/Aramaic origin: &#x27;girl&#x27;, that could have been transmitted by Phoenicians or by the Greeks (Greek: ). The word &#x27;house&#x27; is a false cognate to the Coptic &#x27;house&#x27;.

In addition to words believed to have been borrowed into Etruscan from Indo-European or elsewhere, there is a corpus of words such as which seem to have been borrowed into Latin from the older Etruscan civilization as a superstrate influence. Some of these words still have widespread currency in English and Latin-influenced languages. Other words believed to have a possible Etruscan origin include:
; arena : from &#x27;arena&#x27; &lt; , &#x27;arena, sand&#x27; &lt; archaic &lt; Sabine , unknown Etruscan word as the basis for &quot;fas-&quot; with Etruscan ending &quot;-ēna&quot;.
; belt : from , &#x27;sword belt&#x27;; the sole connection between this word and Etruscan is a statement by Marcus Terentius Varro that it was of Etruscan origin. All else is speculation.
; market : from Latin , of obscure origin, perhaps Etruscan.
; military : from Latin &#x27;soldier&#x27;; either from Etruscan or related to Greek , &#x27;assembled crowd&#x27; (compare &quot;homily&quot;).
; person : from Middle English , from Old French , from Latin , &#x27;mask&#x27;, probably from Etruscan , &#x27;mask&#x27;.
; satellite : from Latin , meaning &#x27;bodyguard, attendant&#x27;, perhaps from Etruscan . Whatmough considers Latin &quot;satteles&quot; &quot;as one of our securest Etruscan loans in Latin.&quot;

=== Etruscan vocabulary ===
====Numerals====

Much debate has been carried out about a possible Indo-European origin of the Etruscan cardinals. In the words of Larissa Bonfante (1990), &quot;What these numerals show, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is the non-Indo-European nature of the Etruscan language&quot;. Conversely, other scholars, including Francisco R. Adrados, Albert Carnoy, Marcello Durante, Vladimir Georgiev, Alessandro Morandi and Massimo Pittau, have proposed a close phonetic proximity of the first ten Etruscan numerals to the corresponding numerals in other Indo-European languages.

The lower Etruscan numerals are:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

It is unclear which of , , and are 7, 8 and 9. may also mean &#x27;twelve&#x27;, with for &#x27;ten&#x27;.

For higher numbers, it has been determined that is 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and and any two in the series 70–90. is 100 (clearly &lt; 10, just as Proto-Indo-European 100 is from 10). Further, mean &#x27;once, twice, and thrice&#x27; respectively; and &#x27;first&#x27; and &#x27;third&#x27;; &#x27;one by one&#x27;, &#x27;two by two&#x27;; and and are &#x27;double&#x27; and &#x27;quadruple&#x27;.

<text>An election is a formal group decision-making process whereby a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.

Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.

The global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.

Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results). Election is the fact of electing, or being elected.

To &quot;elect&quot; means &quot;to select or make a decision&quot;, and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States . 

==History==

Elections were used as early in history as ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor (see imperial election) and the pope (see papal election).

The Pala King Gopala (ruled  – 770s CE) in early medieval Bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region. In the Chola Empire, around 920 CE, in Uthiramerur (in present-day Tamil Nadu), palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members. The leaves, with candidate names written on them, were put inside a mud pot. To select the committee members, a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available. This was known as the &quot;Kudavolai&quot; system.

The first recorded popular elections of officials to public office, by majority vote, where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office, date back to the Ephors of Sparta in 754 BC, under the mixed government of the Spartan Constitution. Athenian democratic elections, where all citizens could hold public office, were not introduced for another 247 years, until the reforms of Cleisthenes. Under the earlier Solonian Constitution (), all Athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies, on matters of law and policy, and as jurors, but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections. Nor were the lowest of the four classes of Athenian citizens (as defined by the extent of their wealth and property, rather than by birth) eligible to hold public office, through the reforms of Solon. The Spartan election of the Ephors, therefore, also predates the reforms of Solon in Athens by approximately 180 years.
Questions of suffrage, especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections. Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries. Early elections in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States were dominated by landed or ruling class males. By 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider women&#x27;s suffrage. Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see civil rights movement).

==Contexts==
Elections are held in a variety of political, organizational, and corporate settings. Many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments, but other types of organizations hold elections as well. For example, many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors, and these elections may be mandated by corporate law. In many places, an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party. Elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections.

==Electorate==
===Suffrage===
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting. All jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.

In Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see 1967 referendum entry) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote (a large proportion of whom were Aboriginal Australians).

Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.

In the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. 

In some countries, voting is required by law. Eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote. In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.00 fine, which increases to $50.00 if the offender refused to vote prior.

===Voting population===
Historically the size of eligible voters, the electorate, was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city (citizens).

With the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities, expanding the term citizen, the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands.
Elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the Roman Republic, by extending voting rights to citizens outside of Rome with the Lex Julia of 90 BC, reaching an electorate of 910,000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10% in 70 BC, only again comparable in size to the first elections of the United States. At the same time the Kingdom of Great Britain had in 1780 about 214,000 eligible voters, 3% of the whole population. Naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country.

==Candidates==
A representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties.

Non-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a direct democracy, one type of non-partisan democracy, any eligible person can be nominated. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).

==Systems==
Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision. 

The first step is for voters to cast the ballots, which may be simple single-choice ballots, but other types, such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used. Then the votes are tallied, for which various vote counting systems may be used. and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either proportional, majoritarian or mixed. Among the proportional systems, the most commonly used are party-list proportional representation (list PR) systems, among majoritarian are first-past-the-post electoral system (single winner plurality voting) and different methods of majority voting (such as the widely used two-round system). Mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods, with some typically producing results closer to the former (mixed-member proportional) or the other (e.g. parallel voting). 

Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as approval voting, single transferable vote, instant runoff voting or a Condorcet method; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.

While openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter&#x27;s ballot are usually an important exception. The secret ballot is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.

==Campaigns==

When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns. Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize campaign advertising. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods.

The most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the 2012 United States presidential election and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the 2014 Indian general election.

==Timing==
The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office. For that reason, most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example, presidents: the President of Ireland is elected every seven years, the President of Russia and the President of Finland every six years, the President of France every five years, President of the United States every four years.

Predetermined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. They tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make dissolving the legislature (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at a time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the United Kingdom) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and chooses an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a motion of no-confidence). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.

Rolling elections are elections in which all representatives in a body are elected, but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once. Examples are the presidential primaries in the United States, Elections to the European Parliament (where, due to differing election laws in each member state, elections are held on different days of the same week) and, due to logistics, general elections in Lebanon and India. The voting procedure in the Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic are also a classical example.

In rolling elections, voters have information about previous voters&#x27; choices. While in the first elections, there may be plenty of hopeful candidates, in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved. In today&#x27;s context of rapid communication, candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages, because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages.

==Undemocratic==


In many of the countries with weak rule of law, the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being &quot;free and fair&quot; is interference from the incumbent government. Dictators may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favour of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, and defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.

Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being &quot;free and fair&quot; take various forms.

===Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate===
The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press, lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, or lack of access to news and political media. Freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state, favouring certain viewpoints or state propaganda.

===Unfair rules===

Gerrymandering, exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like ballot access rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favour a specific faction or candidate. Scheduling frequent elections can also lead to voter fatigue.

===Interference with campaigns===

Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence. Foreign electoral intervention can also occur, with the United States interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and Russia or the Soviet Union in 36.
In 2018 the most intense interventions, utilizing false information, were by China in Taiwan and by Russia in Latvia; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary.

===Tampering with mechanisms===
This can include falsifying voter instructions,
violation of the secret ballot, ballot stuffing, tampering with voting machines,
destruction of legitimately cast ballots,
voter suppression, voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places. Other examples include persuading candidates not to run, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence.

=== Shams ===


A sham election, or show election, is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on the results of the election.

Sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy. Published results usually show nearly 100% voter turnout and high support (typically at least 80%, and close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidates or for the referendum choice that favours the political party in power. Dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.

Sometimes, only one government-approved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed, or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges (or even without any charges) before the election to prevent them from running.

Ballots may contain only one &quot;yes&quot; option, or in the case of a simple &quot;yes or no&quot; question, security forces often persecute people who pick &quot;no&quot;, thus encouraging them to pick the &quot;yes&quot; option. In other cases, those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so, while those who did not vote (and thus do not receive stamps) are persecuted as enemies of the people.

Sham elections can sometimes backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion, fraud or suppressing the opposition. The most famous example of this was the 1990 Myanmar general election, in which the government-sponsored National Unity Party suffered a landslide defeat by the opposition National League for Democracy and consequently, the results were annulled.


Examples of sham elections include: the 1929 and 1934 elections in Fascist Italy, the 1942 general election in Imperial Japan, those in Nazi Germany, East Germany other than the election in 1990, the 1940 elections of Stalinist &quot;People&#x27;s Parliaments&quot; to legitimise the Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, those in Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, those in Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina, those in Russia under Vladimir Putin (including the 2014 Crimean status referendum, as well as the 2014 Donbas status referendums and the 2022 annexation referendum in Russian-occupied Ukraine), those in Syria under Hafez Al-Assad and his son Bashar Al-Assad, the 2018 and 2024 Venezuelan presidential election, the 1928, 1935, 1942, 1949, 1951 and 1958 elections in Portugal, those in Indonesia during New Order regime, the 1991 and 2019 Kazakh presidential elections, those in North Korea, the 1995 and 2002 presidential referendums in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq.

In Mexico, all of the presidential elections from 1929 to 1982 are considered to be sham elections, as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessors governed the country in a &quot;de facto&quot; single-party system without serious opposition, and they won all of the presidential elections in that period with more than 70% of the vote. The first seriously competitive presidential election in modern Mexican history was that of 1988, in which for the first time the PRI candidate faced two strong opposition candidates, though it is believed that the government rigged the result. The first fair election was held in 1994, though the opposition did not win until 2000.

A predetermined conclusion is permanently established by the regime through suppression of the opposition, coercion of voters, vote rigging, reporting several votes received greater than the number of voters, outright lying, or some combination of these. In an extreme example, Charles D. B. King of Liberia was reported to have won by 234,000 votes in the 1927 general election, a &quot;majority&quot; that was over fifteen times larger than the number of eligible voters.

== Aristocratic ==
Some scholars argue that the predominance of elections in modern liberal democracies masks the fact that they are actually aristocratic selection mechanisms that deny each citizen an equal chance of holding public office. Such views were expressed as early as the time of Ancient Greece by Aristotle. According to French political scientist Bernard Manin, the inegalitarian nature of elections stems from four factors: the unequal treatment of candidates by voters, the distinction of candidates required by choice, the cognitive advantage conferred by salience, and the costs of disseminating information. These four factors result in the evaluation of candidates based on voters&#x27; partial standards of quality and social saliency (for example, skin colour and good looks). This leads to self-selection biases in candidate pools due to unobjective standards of treatment by voters and the costs (barriers to entry) associated with raising one&#x27;s political profile. Ultimately, the result is the election of candidates who are superior (whether in actuality or as perceived within a cultural context) and objectively unlike the voters they are supposed to represent.

Evidence suggests that the concept of electing representatives was originally conceived to be different from democracy. Prior to the 18th century, some societies in Western Europe used sortition as a means to select rulers, a method which allowed regular citizens to exercise power, in keeping with understandings of democracy at the time. The idea of what constituted a legitimate government shifted in the 18th century to include consent, especially with the rise of the enlightenment. From this point onward, sortition fell out of favor as a mechanism for selecting rulers. On the other hand, elections began to be seen as a way for the masses to express popular consent repeatedly, resulting in the triumph of the electoral process until the present day.

This conceptual misunderstanding of elections as open and egalitarian when they are not innately so may thus be a root cause of the problems in contemporary governance. Those in favor of this view argue that the modern system of elections was never meant to give ordinary citizens the chance to exercise power - merely privileging their right to consent to those who rule. Therefore, the representatives that modern electoral systems select for are too disconnected, unresponsive, and elite-serving. To deal with this issue, various scholars have proposed alternative models of democracy, many of which include a return to sortition-based selection mechanisms. The extent to which sortition should be the dominant mode of selecting rulers or instead be hybridised with electoral representation remains a topic of debate.

<text>Enniskillen ( , from , &#x27;Ceithlenn&#x27;s island&#x27;) is the largest town in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It is in the middle of the county, between the Upper and Lower sections of Lough Erne. It had a population of 14,086 at the 2011 Census. Enniskillen Castle was built in the 15th century as a stronghold of the Maguires, before coming under English control in the early 17th century. The castle and town were expanded during the Plantation of Ulster. It was the seat of local government for the former Fermanagh District Council, and is the county town of Fermanagh. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

==Toponymy==
The town&#x27;s name comes from the . This refers to Cethlenn, a figure in Irish mythology who may have been a goddess. Local legend has it that Cethlenn was wounded in battle by an arrow and attempted to swim across the River Erne, which surrounds the island, but she never reached the other side, so the island was named in reference to her. It has been anglicised many ways over the centuries – &quot;Iniskellen&quot;, &quot;Iniskellin&quot;, &quot;Iniskillin&quot;, &quot;Iniskillen&quot;, &quot;Inishkellen&quot;, &quot;Inishkellin&quot;, &quot;Inishkillin&quot;, &quot;Inishkillen&quot; and so on.

== History ==

The town&#x27;s oldest building is Enniskillen Castle, built by Hugh (Maguire) the Hospitable who died in 1428. An earthwork, the Skonce on the shore of Lough Erne, may be the remains of an earlier motte. The castle was the stronghold of the junior branch of the Maguires. The first watergate was built around 1580 by Cú Chonnacht Maguire, though subsequent lowering of the level of the lough has left it without water. The strategic position of the castle made its capture important for the English in 1593, to support their plans for the control of Ulster. The castle was besieged three times in 1594–95. The English, led by a Captain Dowdall, captured it in February 1594. Maguire then laid siege to it, and defeated a relieving force at the Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits at Drumane Bridge on the Arney River. Although the defenders were relieved, Maguire gained possession of the castle from 1595 to 1598 and it was not finally captured by the English until 1607.

This was part of a wider campaign to bring the province of Ulster under English control; the final capture of Enniskillen Castle in 1607 was followed by the Plantation of Ulster, during which the lands of the native Irish were seized and handed over to planters loyal to the English Crown. The Maguires were supplanted by William Cole, originally from Devon, who was appointed by James I to build an English settlement there in 1612.

Captain Cole was installed as Constable and strengthened the castle wall and built a &quot;fair house&quot; on the old foundation as the centre point of the county town. The first Protestant parish church was erected on the hilltop in 1627. By 1630 the town had around 180 inhabitants, mostly comprising English and Scottish settlers. The Royal Free School of Fermanagh was moved onto the island in 1643. The first bridges were drawbridges; permanent bridges were not installed before 1688.

By 1689 the town had grown significantly. During the conflict which resulted from the ousting of King James II by his Protestant rival, William III, Enniskillen and Derry were the focus of Williamite resistance in Ireland, including the nearby Battle of Newtownbutler.

Enniskillen and Derry were the two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James II, and it was the last town to fall before the Siege of Derry. As a direct result of this conflict, Enniskillen developed not only as a market town but also as a garrison, which became home to two regiments.

The former site of Fermanagh College at Gaol Square (the college has now moved to the old Erne Hospital site) was the former Enniskillen Gaol. Many people were tried and hanged in the square during the times of public execution. Part of the old goal is still standing. Enniskillen Town Hall was designed by William Scott and completed in 1901.

=== Military history ===
Enniskillen is the site of the foundation of two British Army regiments:
* Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers
* The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons)

The town&#x27;s name (with the archaic spelling) continues to form part of the title to The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment). Enniskillen Castle features on the cap badge of both regiments.

=== The Troubles ===
Enniskillen was the site of several events during The Troubles, the most notable being the Remembrance Day bombing in which 11 people were killed. Bill Clinton opened The Clinton Centre in 2002 on the site of the bombing. The Provisional Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack.

=== Alleged sexual abuse and assault ===
In 2019, at least nine men reported to the police and the press and said in public forums that, in the 1980s and 90s, when they were children, they were repeatedly molested and raped by a paedophile ring of at least 20 men in the Enniskillen area. Investigations are continuing.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* The Enniskillen Dragoon is a famous Irish folk song associated with the Inniskilling Dragoons Regiment. Tommy Makem wrote additional verses and renamed the song Fare Thee Well, Enniskillen.
* The Chieftains sing a song that mentions Enniskillen titled &quot;North Amerikay&quot;.
* Jim Kerr of Simple Minds was so moved by the horror of the Enniskillen bombing in 1987 that he wrote new words to the traditional folk song &quot;She Moved Through The Fair&quot; and the group recorded it with the name &quot;Belfast Child&quot;. The recording reached No. 1 in the UK Charts, Ireland and several other countries in 1989. The single was taken from the album &quot;Street Fighting Years&quot;; the single version was released on the &quot;Ballad of the Streets&quot; EP. The video of the song was shot in black and white and displays poignant footage of children and the destruction of the bombing. Similarly, U2 held a concert the same day as the bombing; during a performance of their song &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, singer Bono passionately condemned the bombing, stating &quot;fuck the revolution&quot; in his mid-song speech. The footage is included in U2&#x27;s rockumentary &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;.
* Neil Hannon also mentions Enniskillen in his song &quot;Sunrise&quot;.
* Bill Fay also mentions Enniskillen in his song &quot;In Human Hands&quot;.
* The Guardian noted that residential areas including Cooper Crescent and Chanterhill Road - inner suburbs just North of the town centre - were the &#x27;poshest&#x27; with much of the fine housing stock located outside of the town centre.
* The Irish language novel &quot;Mo Dhá Mhicí&quot; by Séamus Mac Annaidh is set in Enniskillen.

==Transport==

===Rail – historic===
Railway lines from Enniskillen railway station linked the town with Derry (Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway) from 1854, Dundalk (Irish North Western Railway) from 1861, Bundoran (Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway) from 1868 and Sligo from 1882. By 1883 the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) absorbed all the lines except the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SLNCR), which remained independent throughout its existence. In October 1957 the Government of Northern Ireland closed the GNR lines, which made it impossible for the SLNCR to continue and forced it to also close.

== Twinning ==
Enniskillen was originally twinned with Brackwede – a Bielefeld suburb – where the Inniskilling Dragoon Guards were stationed in the late 1950s when the twinning was initiated; however, this suburb was incorporated into Stadt Bielefeld in 1973, the city with which Enniskillen is now officially twinned.

Though the twinning arrangements are still operational, at a meeting of the Regeneration and Community Committee, in February 2018, it was agreed that the twinning arrangements would be formally terminated at the end of the Council term in June 2018. However, Fermanagh and Omagh District Council still have plans to send representatives to Brackwede for the 60th-anniversary celebrations of the twinning. Therefore, the future of the twinning is now somewhat unclear.

<doc id="9467" wikidata="Q4135602" url="?curid=9467" title="Longest word in English">
<text>The identity of the longest word in English depends on the definition of &quot;word&quot; and of length.

Words may be derived naturally from the language&#x27;s roots or formed by coinage and construction. Additionally, comparisons are complicated because place names may be considered words, technical terms may be arbitrarily long, and the addition of suffixes and prefixes may extend the length of words to create grammatically correct but unused or novel words. Different dictionaries include and omit different words.

The &quot;length&quot; of a word may also be understood in multiple ways. Most commonly, length is based on orthography (conventional spelling rules) and counting the number of written letters. Alternate, but less common, approaches include phonology (the spoken language) and the number of phonemes (sounds).

== Major dictionaries ==
The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is &quot;pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis&quot; (45 letters), a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis. The word was deliberately coined to be the longest word in English, and has since been used in a close approximation of its originally intended meaning, lending at least some degree of validity to its claim.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; contains &quot;pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism&quot; (30 letters).

&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; does not contain &quot;antidisestablishmentarianism&quot; (28 letters), as the editors found no widespread, sustained usage of the word in its original meaning. The longest word in that dictionary is &quot;&quot; (27 letters).

The longest non-technical word in major dictionaries is &quot;&quot; at 29 letters. Consisting of a series of Latin words meaning &quot;nothing&quot; and defined as &quot;the act of estimating something as worthless&quot;; its usage has been recorded as far back as 1741.

Ross Eckler has noted that most of the longest English words are not likely to occur in general text, meaning non-technical present-day text seen by casual readers, in which the author did not specifically intend to use an unusually long word. According to Eckler, the longest words likely to be encountered in general text are &quot;deinstitutionalization&quot; and &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot;, with 22 letters each.

A computer study of over a million samples of normal English prose found that the longest word one is likely to encounter on an everyday basis is &quot;uncharacteristically&quot;, at 20 letters.

== Creations of long words ==
=== Coinages ===
In his play &quot;Assemblywomen&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiazousae&quot;), the ancient Greek comedic playwright Aristophanes created a word of 171 letters (183 in the transliteration below), which describes a dish by stringing together its ingredients:

:Lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphiokarabomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon.
Henry Carey&#x27;s farce &quot;Chrononhotonthologos&quot; (1743) holds the opening line: &quot;Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?&quot;

Thomas Love Peacock put these creations into the mouth of the phrenologist Mr. Cranium in his 1816 book &quot;Headlong Hall&quot;: &quot;osteosarchaematosplanchnochondroneuromuelous&quot; (44 characters) and &quot;osseocarnisanguineoviscericartilaginonervomedullary&quot; (51 characters).

James Joyce made up nine 100-letter words plus one 101-letter word in his novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, the most famous of which is Bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk. Appearing on the first page, it allegedly represents the symbolic thunderclap associated with the fall of Adam and Eve. As it appears nowhere else except in reference to this passage, it is generally not accepted as a real word. Sylvia Plath made mention of it in her semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, when the protagonist was reading &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

&quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;, the 34-letter title of a song from the movie &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, does appear in several dictionaries, but only as a proper noun defined in reference to the song title. The attributed meaning is &quot;a word that you say when you don&#x27;t know what to say.&quot; The idea and invention of the word is credited to songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman.

=== Agglutinative constructions ===
The English language permits the legitimate extension of existing words to serve new purposes by the addition of prefixes and suffixes. This is sometimes referred to as agglutinative construction. This process can create arbitrarily long words: for example, the prefixes &quot;pseudo&quot; (false, spurious) and &quot;anti&quot; (against, opposed to) can be added as many times as desired. More familiarly, the addition of numerous &quot;great&quot;s to a relative, such as &quot;great-great-great-great-grandparent&quot;, can produce words of arbitrary length. In musical notation, an 8192nd note may be called a &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Antidisestablishmentarianism&quot; is the longest common example of a word formed by agglutinative construction.

=== Technical terms ===

A number of scientific naming schemes can be used to generate arbitrarily long words.

The IUPAC nomenclature for organic chemical compounds is open-ended, giving rise to the 189,819-letter chemical name &quot;Methionylthreonylleucine&quot; for the protein also known as titin, which is involved in striated muscle formation. In nature, DNA molecules can be much bigger than protein molecules and therefore potentially be referred to with much longer chemical names. For example, the wheat chromosome 3B contains almost 1 billion base pairs, so the sequence of one of its strands, if written out in full like &quot;Adenilyladenilylguanilylcystidyl&quot;, would be about 8billion letters long. The longest published word, &quot;Acetylseryltyrosylseryl&quot;, referring to the coat protein of a certain strain of tobacco mosaic virus (), is 1,185 letters long, and appeared in the American Chemical Society&#x27;s Chemical Abstracts Service in 1964 and 1966. In 1965, the Chemical Abstracts Service overhauled its naming system and started discouraging excessively long names. In 2011, a dictionary broke this record with a 1909-letter word describing the &quot;trpA&quot; protein ().

John Horton Conway and Landon Curt Noll developed an open-ended system for naming powers of 10, in which one &quot;, coming from the Latin name for 6560, is the name for 103(6560+1) = 1019683. Under the long number scale, it would be 106(6560) = 1039360.

&quot; is sometimes cited as the longest binomial name—it is a kind of amphipod. However, this name, proposed by B. Dybowski, was invalidated by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1929 after being petitioned by Mary J. Rathbun to take up the case.

&quot;Myxococcus llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogochensis&quot; is the longest accepted binomial name for an organism. It is a bacterium found in soil collected at Llanfairpwllgwyngyll (discussed below). &quot;Parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides&quot; is the longest accepted binomial name for any animal, or any organism visible with the naked eye. It is a species of soldier fly. The genus name &quot;Parapropalaehoplophorus&quot; (a fossil glyptodont, an extinct family of mammals related to armadillos) is two letters longer, but does not contain a similarly long species name.

&quot;&quot;, at 52 letters, describing the spa waters at Bath, England, is attributed to Dr. Edward Strother (1675–1737). The word is composed of the following elements:
* Aequeo: equal (Latin, aequo)
* Salino: containing salt (Latin, salinus)
* Calcalino: calcium (Latin, calx)
* Ceraceo: waxy (Latin, &quot;cera&quot;)
* Aluminoso: alumina (Latin)
* Cupreo: from &quot;copper&quot;
* Vitriolic: resembling vitriol

== Notable long words ==
=== Place names ===


The longest officially recognized place name in an English-speaking country is  (85 letters), which is a hill in New Zealand (see the signpost photo on this page). The name is in the Māori language. There are several variant spellings of the name, including some that are longer. In Māori, the digraphs &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;wh&quot; are each treated as single letters.

In Canada, the longest place name is &quot;Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Guilford, Harburn, Bruton, Havelock, Eyre and Clyde&quot;, a township in Ontario, at 61 letters or 68 non-space characters.

The 58-letter name &quot;Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch&quot; is the name of a town on Anglesey, an island of Wales. In terms of the traditional Welsh alphabet, the name is only 51 letters long, as certain digraphs in Welsh are considered as single letters, for instance &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;ch&quot;. It is generally agreed, however, that this invented name, adopted in the mid-19th century, was contrived solely to be the longest name of any town in Britain. The official name of the place is &quot;Llanfairpwllgwyngyll&quot;, commonly abbreviated to &quot;Llanfairpwll&quot; or &quot;Llanfair PG&quot;.

The longest non-contrived place name in the United Kingdom which is a single non-hyphenated word is Cottonshopeburnfoot (19 letters) and the longest which is hyphenated is Sutton-under-Whitestonecliffe (29 characters).

The longest place name in the United States (45 letters) is &quot;&quot;, a lake in Webster, Massachusetts. It means &quot;Fishing Place at the Boundaries – Neutral Meeting Grounds&quot; and is sometimes facetiously translated as &quot;you fish your side of the water, I fish my side of the water, nobody fishes the middle&quot;. The lake is also known as Webster Lake. The longest hyphenated names in the U.S. are &quot;Winchester-on-the-Severn&quot;, a town in Maryland, and &quot;Washington-on-the-Brazos&quot;, a notable place in Texas history. The longest single-word town names in the U.S. are Kleinfeltersville, Pennsylvania and Mooselookmeguntic, Maine.

The longest official geographical name in Australia is . It has 26 letters and is a Pitjantjatjara word meaning &quot;where the Devil urinates&quot;.

Liechtenstein is the longest single-word country name in English, and the second-longest is Turkmenistan.

=== Personal names ===
&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; formerly contained a category for longest personal name used.
* From about 1975 to 1985, the recordholder was Adolph Blaine Charles David Earl Frederick Gerald Hubert Irvin John Kenneth Lloyd Martin Nero Oliver Paul Quincy Randolph Sherman Thomas Uncas Victor William Xerxes Yancy Zeus Senior (746 letters), also known as Wolfe+585, Senior.
* After 1985 Guinness briefly awarded the record to a newborn girl with a longer name. The category was removed shortly afterward.

Long birth names are often coined in protest of naming laws or for other personal reasons.
* The naming law in Sweden was challenged by parents Lasse Diding and Elisabeth Hallin, who proposed the given name &quot;Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116&quot; for their child (pronounced , 43 characters), which was rejected by a district court in Halmstad, southern Sweden.

* &quot;Schmaltzed&quot; and &quot;strengthed&quot; (10 letters) appear to be the longest monosyllabic words recorded in &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, while &quot;scraunched&quot; and &quot;scroonched&quot; appear to be the longest monosyllabic words recorded in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;; but &quot;squirrelled&quot; (11 letters) is the longest if pronounced as one syllable only (as permitted in &quot;The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&quot; at &quot;squirrel&quot;, and in &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;). &quot;Schtroumpfed&quot; (12 letters) was coined by Umberto Eco, while &quot;broughammed&quot; (11 letters) was coined by William Harmon after &quot;broughamed&quot; (10 letters) was coined by George Bernard Shaw.
* &quot;Strengths&quot; is the longest word in the English language containing only one vowel letter.
* &quot;Euouae&quot;, a medieval musical term, is the longest English word consisting only of vowels, and the word with the most consecutive vowels. However, the &quot;word&quot; itself is simply a mnemonic consisting of the vowels to be sung in the phrase &quot;seculorum Amen&quot; at the end of the lesser doxology. (Although &quot;u&quot; was often used interchangeably with &quot;v&quot;, and the variant &quot;Evovae&quot; is occasionally used, the &quot;v&quot; in these cases would still be a vowel.)
* The longest words with no repeated letters are &quot;subdermatoglyphic&quot;, &quot;dermatoglyphics&quot;, and &quot;uncopyrightable&quot;.
* The longest word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight-letter &quot;Aegilops&quot;, a grass genus. However, this is arguably a proper noun. There are several six-letter English words with their letters in alphabetical order, including &quot;abhors&quot;, &quot;almost&quot;, &quot;begins&quot;, &quot;biopsy&quot;, &quot;chimps&quot; and &quot;chintz&quot;. There are few 7-letter words, such as &quot;billowy&quot; and &quot;beefily&quot;. The longest words whose letters are in reverse alphabetical order are &quot;sponged&quot;, &quot;wronged&quot; and &quot;trollied&quot;.
* The longest word without any of the main five vowels but including Y: &quot;Twyndyllyng&quot;.
* The longest words recorded in OED with each vowel only once, and in order, are &quot;abstemiously&quot;, &quot;affectiously&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (OED). &quot;Fracedinously&quot; and &quot;gravedinously&quot; (constructed from adjectives in OED) have thirteen letters; &quot;Gadspreciously&quot;, constructed from &quot;Gadsprecious&quot; (in OED), has fourteen letters. &quot;Facetiously&quot; is among the few other words directly attested in OED with single occurrences of all six vowels (counting &quot;y&quot; as a vowel).
* The longest word without descenders or ascenders is &quot;overnumerousnesses&quot;.
* The longest single palindromic word in English is &quot;rotavator&quot;, another name for a rotary tiller for breaking and aerating soil.

==== Typed words ====
* The longest words typable with only the left hand using conventional hand placement on a QWERTY keyboard are &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the more common but sometimes hyphenated &quot;sweaterdresses&quot;. Using the right hand alone, the longest word that can be typed is &quot;johnny-jump-up&quot;, or, excluding hyphens, &quot;monimolimnion&quot; and &quot;phyllophyllin&quot;.
* The longest English word typable using only the top row of letters has 11 letters: &quot;rupturewort&quot;. The word &quot;teetertotter&quot; (used in North American English) is longer at 12 letters, although it is usually spelled with a hyphen.
* The longest using only the middle row is &quot;shakalshas&quot; (10 letters). Nine-letter words include &quot;flagfalls&quot;; eight-letter words include &quot;galahads&quot; and &quot;alfalfas&quot;.
* Since the bottom row contains no vowels, no standard words can be formed.
* The longest word typable by alternating left and right hands is &quot;antiskepticism&quot;.
* On a Dvorak keyboard, the longest &quot;left-handed&quot; words are &quot;epopoeia&quot;, &quot;jipijapa&quot;, &quot;peekapoo&quot;, and &quot;quiaquia&quot;. Other such long words are &quot;papaya&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;opaque&quot;, and &quot;upkeep&quot;. &quot;Kikuyu&quot; is typed entirely with the index finger, and so the longest one-fingered word on the Dvorak keyboard. There are no vowels on the right-hand side, and so the longest &quot;right-handed&quot; word is crwths.
* The word that has the most consecutive letters that are shared on a phone keyboard is &quot;nonmonotonic&quot;.

<doc id="9469" wikidata="Q188954" url="?curid=9469" title="Eric S. Raymond">
<text>Eric Steven Raymond (born December 4, 1957), often referred to as ESR, is an American software developer, open-source software advocate, and author of the 1997 essay and 1999 book &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;. He wrote a guidebook for the Roguelike game &quot;NetHack&quot;. In the 1990s, he edited and updated the Jargon File, published as &quot;The New Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

== Early life ==
Raymond was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1957, and lived in Venezuela as a child. His family moved to Pennsylvania in 1971. He developed cerebral palsy at birth; his weakened physical condition motivated him to go into computing.

==Career==
Raymond began his programming career writing proprietary software, between 1980 and 1985. In 1990, noting that the Jargon File had not been maintained since about 1983, he adopted it, but not without criticism; Paul Dourish maintains an archived original version of the Jargon File, because, he says, Raymond&#x27;s updates &quot;essentially destroyed what held it together.&quot;

In 1996, Raymond took over development of the open-source email software &quot;popclient&quot;, renaming it to Fetchmail. Soon after this experience, in 1997, he wrote the essay &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;, detailing his thoughts on open-source software development and why it should be done as openly as possible (the &quot;bazaar&quot; approach). The essay was based in part on his experience in developing Fetchmail. He first presented his thesis at the annual Linux Kongress on May 27, 1997. He later expanded the essay into a book, &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary&quot;, in 1999. The essay has been widely cited. The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the Mozilla (then Netscape) source code in 1998 cited &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; as &quot;independent validation&quot; of ideas proposed by Eric Hahn and Jamie Zawinski. Hahn would later describe the 1999 book as &quot;clearly influential&quot;.

From the late 1990s onward, due in part to the popularity of his essay, Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement. He co-founded the Open Source Initiative (OSI) in 1998, taking on the self-appointed role of ambassador of open source to the press, business and public. He remains active in OSI, but stepped down as president of the initiative in February 2005. In early March 2020, he was removed from two Open Source Initiative mailing lists due to posts that violated the OSI&#x27;s Code of Conduct.

In 1998, Raymond received and published a Microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open-source software. He named this document, together with others subsequently leaked, &quot;The Halloween Documents&quot;.

Between 2000 and 2002, he created Configuration Menu Language 2 (CML2), a source code configuration system; while originally intended for the Linux operating system, it was rejected by kernel developers. (Raymond attributed this rejection to &quot;kernel list politics&quot;, but Linus Torvalds said in a 2007 mailing list post that as a matter of policy, the development team preferred more incremental changes.) Raymond&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; discusses user tools for programming and other tasks.

Some versions of &quot;NetHack&quot; still include Raymond&#x27;s guide. He has also contributed code and content to the free software video game &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot;.

Raymond is the main developer of NTPsec, a &quot;secure, hardened replacement&quot; for the Unix utility NTP.

Raymond has written numerous open-source tools, including cvs-fast-export, a tool for exporting CVS repositories to Git fast-import streams, and &quot;reposurgeon&quot;, a tool for exporting SVN repositories.

== Views on open source ==
Raymond coined an aphorism he dubbed Linus&#x27;s law, inspired by Linus Torvalds: &quot;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;. It first appeared in his book &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;.

Raymond has refused to speculate on whether the &quot;bazaar&quot; development model could be applied to works such as books and music, saying that he does not want to &quot;weaken the winning argument for open-sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser&quot;.

Raymond claims his method of promoting open-source software has been effective because he has used &quot;a strategy of making rational, technical, utility-maximization arguments in which I explicitly disclaimed having any normative or moralizing agenda.&quot; Raymond has had a number of public disputes with other figures in the free software movement. As head of the Open Source Initiative, he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products. The &quot;very seductive&quot; moral and ethical rhetoric of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation fails, he said, &quot;not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language ... simply does not persuade anybody&quot;.

In a 2008 essay, he defended programmers&#x27; right to issue work under proprietary licenses: &quot;I think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it, it&#x27;s neither my business nor anyone else&#x27;s but his customer&#x27;s what the terms of sale are.&quot; In the same essay he described his own strong emotional response to proprietary software and negative experiences working as a software developer writing proprietary software.

==Political beliefs and activism==
Raymond is a member of the Libertarian Party and a gun rights advocate. He has endorsed the open source firearms organization Defense Distributed, calling them &quot;friends of freedom&quot; and writing &quot;I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force. As 3D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous, this could be a major step in the right direction.&quot;

In 2015, Raymond accused the Ada Initiative and other women in tech groups of attempting to entrap male open source leaders and accuse them of rape, saying &quot;Try to avoid even being alone, ever, because there is a chance that a &#x27;women in tech&#x27; advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp.&quot;

Raymond has claimed that &quot;Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got AIDS as a consequence&quot;, and that &quot;Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat, are being rational, not racist.&quot; A progressive campaign, &quot;The Great Slate&quot;, was successful in raising funds for candidates in part by asking for contributions from tech workers in return for not posting similar quotes by Raymond. Matasano Security employee and Great Slate fundraiser Thomas Ptacek said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been torturing Twitter with lurid Eric S. Raymond quotes for years. Every time I do, 20 people beg me to stop.&quot; It is estimated that, as of March 2018, over $30,000 has been raised in this way.

==Religious beliefs==
Raymond describes himself as neo-pagan.

<doc id="9471" wikidata="Q61895854" url="?curid=9471" title="Externalization (psychology)">
<text>Externalization is a term used in psychoanalytic theory which describes the tendency to project one&#x27;s internal states onto the outside world. It is generally regarded as an unconscious defense mechanism, thus the person is unaware they are doing it. Externalization takes on a different meaning in narrative therapy, where the client is encouraged to externalize a problem in order to gain a new perspective on it.

==Psychoanalysis==
In Freudian psychology, externalization (or externalisation) is a defense mechanism by which an individual projects their own internal characteristics onto the outside world, particularly onto other people. For example, a patient who is overly argumentative might instead perceive others as argumentative and themselves as blameless.

Like other defense mechanisms, externalization can be a protection against anxiety and is, therefore, part of a healthy, normally functioning mind. However, if taken to excess, it can lead to the development of a neurosis.

==Narrative therapy==

Michael White states that the problem of the client is externalized, to alter the client&#x27;s point of view.

== Neuroscience of externalization ==
Problems with self-regulation, including impulsivity, violence, sensation-seeking, and rule-breaking, are indicative of an externalizing risk pathway. A discrepancy exists between bottom-up reward-related circuitry, such as the ventral striatum, and top-down inhibitory control circuitry, which is located in the prefrontal cortex, linking externalizing behaviors. Externalization is often related to substance use disorders. In particular, alcohol use disorder is one of disorders that much externalization research has been dedicated to. Often, issues within the externalizing risk pathway, namely vulnerabilities in self-regulation, may impact the development of alcohol use disorder differently across stages of the addiction cycle. Likewise, marijuana use has been linked to an externalizing pathway that highlights aggressive and delinquent behavior.  Another type of disorder that is linked to the externalizing pathway is Antisocial Personality Disorder due to its tendency to relate by lack of constraint. Much research has examined the similarities of antisocial personality disorder and substance use disorder in relation to externalizing behaviors.

<doc id="9472" wikidata="Q4916" url="?curid=9472" title="Euro">
<text>The euro (symbol: [[euro sign|€]]; currency code: EUR) is the official currency of 20 of the member states of the European Union. This group of states is officially known as the euro area or, more commonly, the eurozone. The euro is divided into 100 euro cents.

The currency is also used officially by the institutions of the European Union, by four European microstates that are not EU members, the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, as well as unilaterally by Montenegro and Kosovo. Outside Europe, a number of special territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. 

The euro is used by 350 million people in Europe and additionally, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro. It is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar. with more than €1.3 trillion in circulation, the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world.

The name &quot;euro&quot; was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743 at the time). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies.

Between December 1999 and December 2002, the euro traded below the US dollar, but has since traded near parity with or above the US dollar, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008 and since then returning near to its original issue rate. On 13 July 2022, the two currencies hit parity for the first time in nearly two decades due in part to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then, in September 2022, the US dollar again had a face value higher than the Euro, at around US dollar 0.95 per euro.

==Characteristics==
===Administration===
The euro is managed and administered by the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem, composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries. As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of euro banknotes and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.

Through their ratification of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty (or subsequent treaties of accession), most EU member states commited to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all participating states have done so. Denmark has negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 non-binding referendum, and has circumvented its commitment to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course. The Maastricht Treaty was amended by the 2001 Treaty of Nice, which closed the gaps and loopholes in the Maastricht and Rome Treaties.

==Countries that use the euro==

The euro is the official currency of 43 countries and territories:

===Eurozone members===

The 20 participating members are: 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
===Special territories of members of the European Economic Area===

EU Outermost Regions:
**
** Martinique 
**
*
**
**
Overseas Territories:
**
** Saint Barthélemy
** Saint Pierre and Miquelon
Special Autonomous Territories:
**
** Mount Athos
**

===Other users===
Microstates with a monetary agreement:
* 
* 
British Overseas Territory: 


Unilateral adopters: 
* 
==EU members not using the euro ==

=== Committed to adopt the euro ===

The following six EU member states, representing 95 million people, committed themselves in their respective Treaty of Accession to adopt the euro. However they do not have a deadline to do so and can delay the process by deliberately not complying with the convergence criteria (such as by not meeting the convergence criteria to join ERM II). Bulgaria and Romania are actively working to adopt the euro, while the four remaining states do not have a migration plan in progress.

* : The Bulgarian government aims to replace the Bulgarian lev with the euro by 2026. In November 2023, Bulgarian euro coin design has been revealed and approved by the Bulgarian National Bank.
* 
* 

===Opt-outs===

The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 included protocols on Denmark and the United Kingdom, giving them opt-outs with the right to decide if and when they would adopt the euro.

* : The government of Denmark negotiated an opt-out to retain usage of the Danish krone.
* : Prior to its withdrawal from the European Union in 2020, the United Kingdom negotiated an opt-out to retain usage of the Sterling.

==Coins and banknotes==
===Coins===

The euro is divided into 100 cents (also referred to as &quot;euro cents&quot;, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; are spelled without the &quot;s&quot;, notwithstanding normal English usage. Otherwise, normal English plurals are used, with many local variations such as &quot;centime&quot; in France.

All circulating coins have a &quot;common side&quot; showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the linguistic plurality in the European Union, the Latin alphabet version of &quot;euro&quot; is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and Arabic numerals (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map only showed the 15 member states of the union as of 2002. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country), the old map was replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the EU. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the EU member states as of 2002, raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a &quot;national side&quot; showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.

The coins are issued in denominations of €2, €1, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c. To avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and Ireland (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland and Italy (by law). This practice is discouraged by the commission, as is the practice of certain shops of refusing to accept high-value euro notes.

Commemorative coins with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.

====Coin minting====
A number of institutions are authorised to mint euro coins:

* Bayerisches Hauptmünzamt (Mint mark: D)
* Currency Centre
* Real Casa de la Moneda
* Hamburgische Münze (J)
* Hrvatska kovnica novca
* Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda
* Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato
* Koninklijke Munt van België/Monnaie Royale de Belgique
* Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt
* Lietuvos monetų kalykla
* Mincovňa Kremnica
* Monnaie de Paris
* Münze Österreich
* Suomen Rahapaja/Myntverket i Finland
* Staatliche Münze Berlin (A)
* Staatliche Münzen Baden-Württemberg (F): Stuttgart, (G): Karlsruhe
===Banknotes===

The design for the euro banknotes has common designs on both sides. The design was created by the Austrian designer Robert Kalina. Notes are issued in €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, and €5. Each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture. The front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges, symbolising links between states in the union and with the future. While the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, the initial designs by Robert Kalina were of specific bridges, including the Rialto and the Pont de Neuilly, and were subsequently rendered more generic; the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes; thus they are not truly generic. The monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone.

The Europa series, or second series, consists of six denominations and no longer includes the €500 with issuance discontinued as of 27 April 2019. However, both the first and the second series of euro banknotes, including the €500, remain legal tender throughout the euro area.

In December 2021, the ECB announced its plans to redesign euro banknotes by 2024. A theme advisory group, made up of one member from each euro area country, was selected to submit theme proposals to the ECB. The proposals will be voted on by the public; a design competition will also be held.

Since 1 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB&#x27;s banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.

====Banknote printing====
Member states are authorised to print or to commission bank note printing. , these are the printers:

* Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato
* Banco de Portugal
* Bank of Greece
* Bank of France
* Bundesdruckerei
* Central Bank of Ireland
* De La Rue
* Real Casa de la Moneda
* François-Charles Oberthür
* Giesecke+Devrient
* Royal Joh. Enschedé
* National Bank of Belgium
* Oesterreichische Nationalbank
* Setec Oy
===Payments clearing, electronic funds transfer===
Capital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one state to another. All intra-Union transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, T2 since March 2023, for large euro transactions.

==History==
===Introduction===
The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than 3% of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which resulted in the introduction of the euro (see also United Kingdom and the euro).

The name &quot;euro&quot; was officially adopted in Madrid on 16 December 1995. Belgian Esperantist Germain Pirlot, a former teacher of French and history, is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, suggesting the name &quot;euro&quot; on 4 August 1995.

Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro. The &quot;definitive&quot; values of one euro in terms of the exchange rates at which the currency entered the euro are shown in the table.

The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally pound sterling) that day.

The procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the Greek drachma and the euro was different since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.

The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller&#x27;s cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.

The changeover period during which the former currencies&#x27; notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remained exchangeable until 2022.

===Currency sign===

A special euro currency sign (€) was designed after a public survey had narrowed ten of the original thirty proposals down to two. The President of the European Commission at the time (Jacques Santer) and the European Commissioner with responsibility for the euro (Yves-Thibault de Silguy) then chose the winning design.

Regarding the symbol, the European Commission stated on behalf of the European Union:

The European Commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions. Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from state to state, but for texts in English published by EU institutions, the symbol (or the ISO-standard &quot;EUR&quot;) should precede the amount.

===Eurozone crisis===

Following the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. All these countries used EU funds except Italy, which is a major donor to the EFSF. To be included in the eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2011, &quot;[I]f the [euro area] is treated as a single entity, its [economic and fiscal] position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK&quot; and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area&#x27;s government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the United States. &quot;Moreover&quot;, they write, &quot;private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon economies&quot;. The authors conclude that the crisis &quot;is as much political as economic&quot; and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of &quot;institutional paraphernalia (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state&quot;.

The crisis continued with S&amp;P downgrading the credit rating of nine euro-area countries, including France, then downgrading the entire European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) fund.

A historical parallel – to 1931 when Germany was burdened with debt, unemployment and austerity while France and the United States were relatively strong creditors – gained attention in summer 2012 even as Germany received a debt-rating warning of its own.

==Direct and indirect usage==

===Agreed direct usage with minting rights===
The euro is the sole currency of 20 EU member states: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. These countries constitute the &quot;eurozone&quot;, some 347 million people in total . According to bilateral agreements with the EU, the euro has also been designated as the sole and official currency in a further four European microstates awarded minting rights (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City). All but one (Denmark) current, and any potential future EU members, are obliged to adopt the euro when economic conditions permit.

===Agreed direct usage without minting rights===
The euro is also the sole currency in three overseas territories of France that are not themselves part of the EU, namely Saint Barthélemy, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, as well as in the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

===Unilateral direct usage===
The euro has been adopted unilaterally as the sole currency of Montenegro and Kosovo. It has also been used as a foreign trading currency in Cuba since 1998, Syria since 2006, and Venezuela since 2018. In 2009, Zimbabwe abandoned its local currency and introduced major global convertible currencies instead, including the euro and the United States dollar. The direct usage of the euro outside of the official framework of the EU affects nearly 3 million people.

===Currencies pegged to the euro===

Outside the eurozone, two EU member states have currencies that are pegged to the euro, which is a precondition to joining the eurozone. The Danish krone and Bulgarian lev are pegged due to their participation in the ERM II.

Additionally, a total of 22 countries and territories that do not belong to the EU have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including 14 countries in mainland Africa (CFA franc), three African island countries (Comorian franc, Cape Verdean escudo and São Tomé and Príncipe dobra (since 1 January 2010)), three French Pacific territories (CFP franc) and two Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark) and North Macedonia (Macedonian denar). Additionally, the Moroccan dirham is tied to a basket of currencies, including the euro and the US dollar, with the euro given the highest weighting.

These countries generally had previously implemented a currency peg to one of the major European currencies (e.g. the French franc, Deutsche Mark or Portuguese escudo), and when these currencies were replaced by the euro their currencies became pegged to the euro. Pegging a country&#x27;s currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation, and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.

In total, , 182 million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro, 27 million people outside the eurozone in Europe, and another 545,000 people on Pacific islands.

Since 2005, stamps issued by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta have been denominated in euros, although the Order&#x27;s official currency remains the Maltese scudo. The Maltese scudo itself is pegged to the euro and is only recognised as legal tender within the Order.

The currency of a number of states is pegged to the euro. These states are:

===Use as reserve currency===
Since its introduction in 1999, the euro has been the second most widely held international reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and that held in RMB fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built on the status of the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1 trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.

The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency has been debated among economists. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was &quot;absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency&quot;. In contrast to Greenspan&#x27;s 2007 assessment, the euro&#x27;s increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.

==Economics==
===Optimal currency area===
In economics, an optimum currency area, or region (OCA or OCR), is a geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by Robert Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro. However, even before the creation of the single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the late-2000s recession it was considered unlikely that a state would leave the euro or the whole zone would collapse. However the Greek government-debt crisis led to former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form. Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, explains it: 

Increasing business cycle divergence across the Eurozone over the last decades implies a decreasing Optimum Currency Area.

===Transaction costs and risks===

The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).

Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more liquid and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.

===Price parity===

Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of the law of one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.

===Macroeconomic stability===

Before the introduction of the euro, some countries had successfully contained inflation, which was then seen as a major economic problem, by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the Bundesbank in Germany; the European Central Bank was modelled on the Bundesbank.

The euro has come under criticism due to its regulation, lack of flexibility and rigidity towards sharing member states on issues such as nominal interest rates.
Many national and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.

There is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the United States, United Kingdom, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers; hence export from the eurozone becomes more difficult.

In general, those in Europe who own large amounts of euro are served by high stability and low inflation.

A monetary union means states in that union lose the main mechanism of recovery of their international competitiveness by weakening (depreciating) their currency. When wages become too high compared to productivity in the exports sector, then these exports become more expensive and they are crowded out from the market within a country and abroad. This drives the fall of employment and output in the exports sector and fall of trade and current account balances. Fall of output and employment in the tradable goods sector may be offset by the growth of non-exports sectors, especially in construction and services. Increased purchases abroad and negative current account balances can be financed without a problem as long as credit is cheap. The need to finance trade deficit weakens currency, making exports automatically more attractive in a country and abroad. A state in a monetary union cannot use weakening of currency to recover its international competitiveness. To achieve this a state has to reduce prices, including wages (deflation). This could result in high unemployment and lower incomes as it was during the European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Trade====
The euro increased price transparency and stimulated cross-border trade. A 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, and a meta-analysis of all available studies on the effect of introduction of the euro on increased trade suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Although a more recent meta-analysis shows that publication bias decreases over time and that there are positive trade effects from the introduction of the euro, as long as results from before 2010 are taken into account. This may be because of the inclusion of the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and ongoing integration within the EU. Furthermore, older studies based on certain methods of analysis of main trends reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade. According to Barry Eichengreen, studies disagree on the magnitude of the effect of the euro on trade, but they agree that it did have an effect.

====Investment====
Physical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.

====Inflation====

The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so. Based on the introduction of the euro as the official currency in Croatia in 2023, the ECB argues that inflation due to a change of currency is a one-time effect of limited impact.

====Exchange rate risk====
One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates. It has been found that the introduction of the euro created &quot;significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside Europe&quot;. These reductions in market risk &quot;were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe&quot;.

====Financial integration====
The introduction of the euro increased financial integration within Europe, which helped stimulate growth of a European securities market (bond markets are characterized by economies of scale dynamics). According to a study on this question, it has &quot;significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets [...] However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated.&quot; Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone. On a global level, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries. Financial integration made it cheaper for European companies to borrow. Banks, firms and households could also invest more easily outside of their own country, thus creating greater international risk-sharing.

====Effect on interest rates====
As of January 2014, and since the introduction of the euro, interest rates of most member countries (particularly those with a weak currency) have decreased. Some of these countries had the most serious sovereign financing problems.

The effect of declining interest rates, combined with excess liquidity continually provided by the ECB, made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so nearly worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Price convergence====
The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).

====Tourism====
A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU, with an increase of 6.5%.

==Exchange rates==
===Flexible exchange rates===

The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general, does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This is because of the implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets and, as the ECB has inflation targeting as its monetary policy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is floating.

===Against other major currencies===

The euro is the second-most widely held reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (3 May vs sterling, 25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese yen). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs US dollar, 23 July vs Japanese yen, 29 December vs sterling). With the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell, to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis, the euro remained stable. In November 2011 the euro&#x27;s exchange rate index – measured against currencies of the bloc&#x27;s major trading partners – was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis began in 2007. In mid July 2022, the euro and the US dollar traded at par for a short period of time during an episode of dollar appreciation. On 11 July 2024, it recorded a new high against the Japanese yen during a long period of depreciation of the latter.

*Current and historical exchange rates against 32 other currencies (European Central Bank): &quot;link&quot;

==Political considerations==
Besides the economic motivations to the introduction of the euro, its creation was also partly justified as a way to foster a closer sense of joint identity between European citizens. Statements about this goal were for instance made by Wim Duisenberg, European Central Bank Governor, in 1998, Laurent Fabius, French Finance Minister, in 2000, and Romano Prodi, President of the European Commission, in 2002. However, 15 years after the introduction of the euro, a study found no evidence that it has had any effect on a shared sense of European identity.

Public support of Euro by country according to Eurobarometer 2024:

==&quot;Euro&quot; in various official EU languages==

The formal titles of the currency are &quot;euro&quot; for the major unit and &quot;cent&quot; for the minor (one-hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular. This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages.

Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; &quot;euro&quot; in the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is spelled () and not (&quot;&quot;) in all official documents. In the Greek script the term () is used; the Greek &quot;cent&quot; coins are denominated in (). Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural, although the European Commission&#x27;s Directorate-General for Translation states that the plural forms &quot;euros&quot; and &quot;cents&quot; should be used in English.
The word &#x27;euro&#x27; is pronounced differently according to pronunciation rules in the individual languages applied; in German , in English , in French , etc.
In summary:
For local phonetics, cent, use of plural and amount formatting (€6,00 or 6.00 €), see Language and the euro.

<text>The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central component of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) as well as one of seven institutions of the European Union. It is one of the world&#x27;s most important central banks with a balance sheet total of around 7 trillion.

The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the Eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU. The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the T2 (RTGS) payments system.

The ECB was established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999 with the purpose of guaranteeing and maintaining price stability. On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon became effective and the bank gained the official status of an EU institution. When the ECB was created, it covered a Eurozone of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014, Lithuania in January 2015 and Croatia in January 2023. The current president of the ECB is Christine Lagarde. Seated in Frankfurt, Germany, the bank formerly occupied the Eurotower prior to the construction of its new seat.

The ECB is directly governed by European Union law. Its capital stock, worth €11 billion, is owned by all 27 central banks of the EU member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states&#x27; population and GDP, but the capital key has been readjusted since. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.

==History==

=== Early years (1998–2007) ===

The European Central Bank is the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU&#x27;s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The EMI itself took over from the earlier European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF).

The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the Treaty on European Union (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU. The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of Pierre Werner and President Jacques Delors. It was established on 1 June 1998 The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg, the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute. While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence, the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet, former head of the French central bank, to be the ECB&#x27;s first president. The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro. Tensions were abated by a gentleman&#x27;s agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet.

Trichet replaced Duisenberg as president in November 2003. Until 2007, the ECB had very successfully managed to maintain inflation close but below 2%.

=== Response to the financial crises (2008–2014) ===
The European Central Bank underwent through a deep internal transformation as it faced the global financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis. 
==== Early response to the Eurozone debt crisis ====
The so-called &quot;European debt crisis&quot; began after Greece&#x27;s new elected government uncovered the real level indebtedness and budget deficit and warned EU institutions of the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default.

Foreseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some Eurozone member states. Consequently, sovereign bonds yields of several Eurozone countries started to rise sharply. This provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets: the more Greek bonds yields rose, the more likely a default became possible, the more bond yields increased in turn.

This panic was also aggravated because of the reluctance of the ECB to react and intervene on sovereign bond markets for two reasons. First, because the ECB&#x27;s legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds in the primary market (Article 123. TFEU), An over-interpretation of this limitation, inhibited the ECB from implementing quantitative easing like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets.

Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB&#x27;s open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB Athanasios Orphanides, this change in the ECB&#x27;s collateral framework &quot;planted the seed&quot; of the euro crisis.

Faced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets. Up until 6 May 2010, Trichet formally denied at several press conferences the possibility of the ECB to embark into sovereign bonds purchases, even though Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy faced waves of credit rating downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads.

==== Market interventions (2010–2011) ====

In a remarkable u-turn, the ECB announced on 10 May 2010, the launch of a &quot;Securities Market Programme&quot; (SMP) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets. Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB&#x27;s usual meeting of 6 May (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to &quot;address severe tensions in financial markets.&quot; The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of 10 May to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.

Although at first limited to the debt of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the bulk of the ECB&#x27;s bond buying eventually consisted of Spanish and Italian debt. These purchases were intended to dampen international speculation against stressed countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries. The assumption—largely justified—was that speculative activity would decrease over time and the value of the assets increase.

Although SMP purchases did inject liquidity into financial markets, all of these injections were &quot;sterilized&quot; through weekly liquidity absorption. So the operation was net neutral in liquidity terms (though this was of little practical importance since normal monetary policy operations were ensuring unlimited supplies of liquidity at the main policy interest rate).

In September 2011, ECB&#x27;s Board member Jürgen Stark, resigned in protest against the &quot;Securities Market Programme&quot; which involved the purchase of sovereign bonds from Southern member states, a move that he considered as equivalent to monetary financing, which is prohibited by the EU Treaty. The &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; referred to this episode as &quot;the end of the ECB as we know it&quot;, referring to its hitherto perceived &quot;hawkish&quot; stance on inflation and its historical Deutsche Bundesbank influence.

As of 18 June 2012, the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of the Securities Markets Programme. Controversially, the ECB made substantial profits out of SMP, which were largely redistributed to Eurozone countries. In 2013, the Eurogroup decided to refund those profits to Greece, however, the payments were suspended from 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between Yanis Varoufakis and ministers of the Eurogroup. In 2018, profits refunds were reinstalled by the Eurogroup. However, several NGOs complained that a substantial part of the ECB profits would never be refunded to Greece.

====Role in the Troika (2010–2015) ====
The ECB played a controversial role in the &quot;Troika&quot; by rejecting most forms of debt restructuring of public and bank debts, and pressing governments to adopt bailout programmes and structural reforms through secret letters to Italian, Spanish, Greek and Irish governments. It has further been accused of interfering in the Greek referendum of July 2015 by constraining liquidity to Greek commercial banks.

In November 2010, reflecting the huge increase in borrowing, including the cover the cost of having guaranteed the liabilities of banks, the cost of borrowing in the private financial markets had become prohibitive for the Irish government. Although it had deferred the cash cost of recapitalising the failing Anglo Irish Bank by nationalising it and issuing it with a &quot;promissory note&quot; (an IOU), the Government also faced a large deficit on its non-banking activities, and it therefore turned to the official sector for a loan to bridge the shortfall until its finances were credibly back on a sustainable footing. Meanwhile, Anglo used the promissory note as collateral for its emergency loan (ELA) from the Central Bank. This enabled Anglo to repay its depositors and bondholders.

It became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish government did not let Anglo default on its debts, to avoid financial instability risks. On 15 October and 6 November 2010, the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sent two secret letters to the Irish finance Minister which essentially informed the Irish government of the possible suspension of ELA&#x27;s credit lines, unless the government requested a financial assistance programme to the Eurogroup under the condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation.

In addition, the ECB insisted that no debt restructuring (or bail-in) should be applied to the nationalized banks&#x27; bondholders, a measure which could have saved Ireland 8 billion euros.

During 2012, the ECB pressed for an early end to the ELA, and this situation was resolved with the liquidation of the successor institution IBRC in February 2013. The promissory note was exchanged for much longer term marketable floating rate notes which were disposed of by the Central Bank over the following decade.

In April 2011, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%, with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011. However, in 2012–2013 the ECB sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth, reaching the historically low 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were cut to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two-thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%. Recently, the interest rates were further reduced reaching 0.00%, the lowest rates on record.

In a report adopted on 13 March 2014, the European Parliament criticized the &quot;potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ECB in the Troika as &#x27;technical advisor&#x27; and its position as a creditor of the four Member States, as well as its mandate under the Treaty&quot;. The report was led by Austrian right-wing MEP Othmar Karas and French Socialist MEP Liem Hoang Ngoc.

====Response under Mario Draghi (2012–2015)====

On 1 November 2011, Mario Draghi replaced Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the ECB. This change in leadership also marks the start of a new era under which the ECB will become more and more interventionist and eventually ended the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.

Draghi&#x27;s presidency started with the impressive launch of a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) – the Long-term Refinancing operations (LTRO). Under this programme, 523 Banks tapped as much as €489.2 bn (US$640 bn). Observers were surprised by the volume of loans made when it was implemented. By far biggest amount of was tapped by banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Although those LTROs loans did not directly benefit EU governments, it effectively allowed banks to do a carry trade, by lending off the LTROs loans to governments with an interest margin. The operation also facilitated the rollover of of maturing bank debts in the first three months of 2012.

===== &quot;Whatever it takes&quot; (26 July 2012) =====
Facing renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone continued Mario Draghi made a decisive speech in London, by declaring that the ECB &quot;...is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough.&quot; In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi&#x27;s statement has been seen as a key turning point in the eurozone crisis, as it was immediately welcomed by European leaders, and led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France.

Following up on Draghi&#x27;s speech, on 6 September 2012 the ECB announced the Outright Monetary Transactions programme (OMT). Unlike the previous SMP programme, OMT has no ex-ante time or size limit. However, the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the ESM. The program was adopted with near unanimity, the Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann being the sole member of the ECB&#x27;s Governing Council to vote against it.

Even if OMT was never actually implemented until today, it made the &quot;Whatever it takes&quot; pledge credible and significantly contributed to stabilizing financial markets and ending the sovereign debt crisis. According to various sources, the OMT programme and &quot;whatever it takes&quot; speeches were made possible because EU leaders previously agreed to build the banking union.

=== Low inflation and quantitative easing (2015–2019) ===
In November 2014, the bank moved into its new premises, while the Eurotower building was dedicated to hosting the newly established supervisory activities of the ECB under European Banking Supervision.

Although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014, the ECB started to face a repeated decline in the Eurozone inflation rate, indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation. Responding to this threat, the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme (CBPP3) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme (ABSPP).

==== Asset Purchase programme (APP) ====
On 22 January 2015, the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge &quot;quantitative easing&quot; programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016. The programme was started on 9 March 2015.

On 8 June 2016, the ECB added corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Under this programme, it conducted the net purchase of corporate bonds until January 2019 to reach about €177 billion. While the programme was halted for 11 months in January 2019, the ECB restarted net purchases in November 2019.

On May 5, 2020, the Court ordered the Bundestag and the Bundesregierung to ensure the ECB had carried out a proportionality assessment of the vast purchases of government debt in the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) to ensure the economic and fiscal policy effects do not outweigh its policy objectives. The PSPP-implementing decision has been considered an act ultra vires by the ECB as it was too arbitrary and lacks reasoning in ints proportionality assessment. This ruling by the German Constitutional Court comes at a difficult time for the ECB as it was at the time considering expanding the PEPP. The ruling also reflects the mistrust within some parts of Germany in the ECB, which is seen there as an institution that bails out profligate Southern European countries. Moreover, this ruling also highlights the vital problem on the euro area architecture, as the range of instruments can use to fulfil its mandate remains unclear.

 the size of the ECB&#x27;s quantitative easing programme had reached 2947 billion euros.

==== Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) ====
The long term refinancing operations (LTRO) are regular open market operations providing financing to credit institutions for periods up to four years. They aim at favoring lending conditions to the private sector and more generally stimulating bank lending to the real economy, thereby fostering growth.

In December 2011 and January 2012, in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the ECB implemented two LTROs, injecting over €1000 billion of liquidity in the Eurozone financial system. They were later criticized for their inability to revive growth and to help truly revive the real economy, despite having stabilized the Eurozone&#x27;s financial institutions. Further, these operations were devoid of monitoring from the ECB regarding the use made of these liquidities and it appeared that banks had significantly used these funds to pursue carry-trade strategies, purchasing sovereign bonds with higher rates and corresponding maturity to generate profits, instead of increasing private lending.

These critics and deficiencies brought the ECB to instigate targeted long term refinancing operations (TLTROs), first in September and later in December 2014. These complementary programs imposed conditionality on the LTROs. The TLTROs provided low cost financing to participating banks, under the condition that they reached certain targets in terms of lending to firms and households. The participating banks were thus more incited to lend to the real economy.

A third wave of TLTRO&#x27;s was announced on 7 March 2019, namely the TLTRO III. Under TLTRO III, the interest rate was set at -0.5% below the deposit facility rate (DFR), under condition that banks reached a specific lending performance threshold. The TLTRO III programme was successful to stimulate credit growth.

=== Christine Lagarde&#x27;s era (2019 – ) ===
In July 2019, EU leaders nominated Christine Lagarde to replace Mario Draghi as ECB President. Lagarde resigned from her position as managing director of the International Monetary Fund in July 2019 and formally took over the ECB&#x27;s presidency on 1 November 2019.

Lagarde immediately signalled a change of style in the ECB&#x27;s leadership. She embarked the ECB on a strategic review of the ECB&#x27;s monetary policy strategy, an exercise the ECB had not done for 17 years. As part of this exercise, Lagarde committed the ECB to look into how monetary policy could contribute to address climate change, and promised that &quot;no stone would be left unturned.&quot; The ECB president also adopted a change of communication style, in particular in her use of social media to promote gender equality, and by opening dialogue with civil society stakeholders.

==== The ECB&#x27;s response to COVID-19 pandemic ====
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented crisis, profoundly impacting global public health, economies, and societal structures on an unparalleled scale. The crisis led to renewed tensions in European sovereign bonds markets, marked by a growing spreads between the interest rates paid by Eurozone member states, which spurred important concerns that the Eurozone couild be headed towards a new sovereign debt crisis.

On 12 March 2020, the ECB announced a set of policy measures such as an additional package of net asset purchases of €120 billion by the end of 2020 under the already existing APP, and more favorable terms on the TLTRO III. During the press conference, Christine Lagarde declared that the ECB &quot;[...] is not here to close spreads.&quot; This particular statement triggered a sudden negative reaction on financial markets, with a widening of yield spreads in Spain, Italy and Greece.

===== Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) =====
On 19 March 2020—less than one week after Lagarde&#x27;s unfortunate statements on the spreads—the ECB announced by surprise the launch of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) worth €750 billion to boost liquidity in the European economy and to contain any sharp increases in sovereign yield spreads. This announcement led to an immediate reboot in stock prices and came one day after the spike of sovereign risk spreads.

The PEPP was designed as a typical &quot;quantitative easing&quot; policy, under which the ECB is able to purchase securities from the private and public sector in a flexible manner. The purpose of the PEPP was to stabilize sovereign bonds yields to low and stable levels, thus preventing self-fulfilling panicks in financial markets as was the case during the European debt crisis.

The PEPP was established as a separate purchase programme alongside the pre-existing Asset Purchase Programme (APP) with the sole purpose to respond to the economic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, and in particular prevent market fragmentations. While very similar, Contrary to the APP, the ECB decided to allow itself to deviate from the capital key. This temporal flexibility from the capital key meant that the ECB could more effectively prevent the rise of Italian and Spanish yield spreads.

Assets meeting the eligibility criteria of the APP were also eligible under the PEPP. However, the pool of assets eligible under the PEPP was broader than the usual ECB collateral eligibility framework. For instance, greek sovereign bonds could be purchased by the ECB under this programme, despite having a credit ratings below the usual investment grade requirement. This waiver was given based on several considerations from the ECB: there was a need to alleviate the pressures stemming from the pandemic on the Greek financial markets; Greece was already and would be closely monitored by giving the waiver; and Greece regained market access. Non-financial commercial paper with a remaining maturity of at least 28 days were also eligible for purchase under the PEPP.

On 4 June 2020, the ECB announced it would expand the PEPP by another €600 billion, as it became clear that the pandemic would continue to harm European economies. Half a year later, on 10 December 2020, the ECB announced its final expansion of the PEPP worth another €500 billion, totalling the final PEPP to €1.850 trillion, corresponding to 15.4% of the euro-area GDP of 2019.

In December 2021 the ECB announced that it would discontinue net purchases under the PEPP as from the end of March 2022 and that it intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities at least until the end of 2024.On 31 March 2022, at the end of the net purchases, the net purchases amounted to €1.718 billion, of which €1.665 billion is invested in public sector securities and €52 billion in private sector securities. Of the total €1.850 billion available under the PEPP, 93% of the full envelope wase used, due to indications of decreased financial stress in the Euro Area, mainly thanks to relaxation of COVID restrictions and the reopening of European markets.
==== Criticism against PEPP ====
Overall, the PEPP programme was widely welcomed by market participants and European policy makers. However in March 2021, a group of German economists and lawyers filed a lawsuit against the PEPP at the German Federal Constitutional Court.

===== New TLTRO III and PELTROs =====
On 30 April 2020, the ECB Governing council introduced additional measures to support the economy during the Covid19 pandemic, including PELTROs and new modalities for the TLTROs.

First, the ECB made several adjustments to the framework of its TLTRO III. A key change was that the ECB also reduced the interest rate applied to these open market operations to a rate going as low as -1% for the banks meeting the lending threshold of 0%. With the TLTRO III, the participating banks were thus enabled to borrow at lower interest rates than those paid on their excess reserve. Another key change was thet ECB&#x27;s decision to expand bank&#x27;s borrowing allowance under TLTRO III from 30% to 50%, then up to 55% of their portfolio of loans to firms and households.

Second, the ECB introduced pandemic emergency long-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). The market operations are similar to the TLTRO III, but are conduced in a more fequent basis in order to ensure smooth liquidity provision to the market.

During the pandemic, these monetary responses proved essential. In their absence, a credit crunch would normally have taken place. Indeed, increase in demand traditionally translates in a rise of borrowing costs. Reports from various member states central banks on the matter indicate that loans supply by participating banks has indeed expanded, in line with the ECB policy. Accordingly, thorough academic studies have confirmed the actual enhancement of financing conditions and the avoidance of credit scarcity. In fact, the credit to firms attained unprecedented levels when from March to May 2020, it increased by €250 billion on aggregate. Furthermore, analysts observed that even non-participating banks (to the TLTROs and PELTROs) benefited from it in parallel manners.

==== Transmission Protection instrument (TPI) ====
The Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) is a tool the ECB could use to ensure monetary policy decisions are smoothly transmitted across all euro area countries, introduced on July 21, 2022. Under the TPI, the ECB would be able to purchase securities in the secondary market, to counter against &quot;unwanted, disorderly market dynamics&quot;, self fulfilling crises market expectations that do not reflect reality, thus not justified by &quot;country specific fundamentals.&quot; The TPI thus enables the ECB to control the difference between borrowing costs across the euro area, thereby reducing fragmentation risk across the euro area. By not letting interfere market dynamics that do not reflect economic reality, the ECB fulfils its secondary mandate under the TFEU, namely &quot;to support the general economic policies of the Union.&quot; Although PEPP would remain the first line of defence to counter for transmission risks, the TPI should be seen as an addition to the ECB&#x27;s toolkit.

===== Eligible securities under the TPI =====
Contrary to the PEPP and the APP, the TPI does not have an &quot;ex ante&quot; upper limit on the purchase of securities. Although the ECB has stated it would primarily buy only government bonds on the secondary market maturing between 1 and 10 years, the bonds purchased fall under the complete discretion of the ECB and does not necessarily follow the capital key, and private securities could be considered as well. However, there are four conditions that need to be met before securities are eligible for purchasing under TPI:

# Compliance with the fiscal framework of the EU and not be involved in the excessive deficit procedure;
# Absence of macroeconomic imbalances and not being involved in an excessive macroeconomic imbalance procedure, demonstrating that it is in compliance with the commission&#x27;s recommendations;
# Sovereign debt trajectory must be sustainable, assessed by the ECB and other relevant bodies;
# Stick to commitments made under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, proving that the government follows sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies.

The conditions for government bonds to be eligible under the TPI draw heavily on the macroeconomic governance, and making sure that politicians do not take decisions that facilitate speculation. The decision by the ECB to support a country by using the TPI will depend on the severity of the risks a country faces. Government debt should thus be sustainable to be eligible for TPI purchases.

If the aforementioned conditions are met, the ECB could decide to activate the TPI. Purchases will be ended under the TPI either due to increased transmission of monetary policy or the risks have proven to be country-specific. So far, the TPI has not been deployed yet.

===== Effects of and critiques on the TPI =====
The TPI enables the Governing Council to a more rapid increase in interest rate, the first raise in interest rates by the ECB in 11 years. and the unpredictable nature of market sentiment could justify the reason for ECB-intervention to stabilise the monetary union, more or less the same reasoning as for the PEPP.

However, the relationship between the PEPP and the TPI raises questions as the PEPP would remain the first line of defence against transmission risks. The creation of the TPI seems legally vulnerably: problems in the Euro Area are common and recurring, but it is not automatically the argument to invent a whole new anti-fragmentation tool. With the TPI, the ECB can put pressure on countries by assessing publicly if they are eligible for the TPI, that is assessing whether the government has conducted adequate fiscal policies and structural reforms to deserve the support of the ECB. This endangers the politic neutrality of the ECB. If ever deployed, the usage of the TPI will spark controversy as the conditions to be deployed are not watertight.

===== Strategy Review (2020-2021) =====
As a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, the ECB extended the duration of the strategy review until September 2021. On 13 July 2021, the ECB presented the outcomes of the strategy review, with the main following announcements:

* The ECB announced a new inflation target of 2% instead of its &quot;close but below two per cent&quot; inflation target. The ECB also made it clear it could overshoot its target under certain circumstances.
* The ECB announced it would try to incorporate the cost of housing (imputed rents) into its inflation measurement
* The ECB announced an action plan on climate change

The ECB also said it would carry out another strategy review in 2025.

=== Inflation surge of 2021 ===
In the summer of 2021, coinciding with the European Central Bank&#x27;s announcement of its revised monetary policy framework and its initiative for climate action, the eurozone witnessed a notable inflationary surge. This resurgence of inflation continued to escalate over the following year, culminating in inflation rates reaching double digits for the first time since the 1970s, a year after the ECB&#x27;s strategic updates. The inflation rate reached an unprecedented peak of 4.9% in November 2021, marking the highest level since the introduction of the euro.

==== Framing of the crisis ====
The new era of inflation prompted a significant shift in the European Central Bank&#x27;s framing compared to its stance in the 2000s. Initially, from its inception until the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the ECB&#x27;s primary objective was price stability, adhering to strict institutional rules that minimized policy trade-offs with other goals beyond price stability. This approach was rooted in the &quot;Central Bank Independence template&quot;, advocating that central bank&#x27;s limited role to price stability and its independence were optimal.

However, the post-financial crisis landscape, especially during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s and subsequent economic stagnation era, necessitated a substantial revision in the ECB&#x27;s strategy. The ECB moved away from its original Central Bank Independence template, leading to a blurring of its objective hierarchy. It adopted new strategies such as acting as a lender of last resort for the banking system and fostering growth through very low interest rates and extensive asset purchase programs, which were designed to help stabilizing specific market segments and in the end revive growth.

In 2021, the European Central Bank embraced a significant strategic pivot by adopting its Climate Action Plan along with a new monetary policy strategy. This shift aimed to institutionalize the ECB&#x27;s evolving role, moving beyond the singular focus on price stability—a policy shaped largely by the aftermath of the European sovereign debt crisis. Instead, the ECB began acknowledging its multifaceted responsibilities, which now include maintaining financial stability, supporting economic growth, and addressing climate-related objectives. However, with the surging of inflation in 2021, some wondered as to whether the European Central Bank would revert to its foundational role, predominantly focused on chasing the “inflation monsters”. The term “inflation monsters&quot; echoes the 2010 video of the ECB where two young people are facing a blue inflation monster unleashing banknotes and threatening to wreck the economy. Nevertheless, ECB policymakers effectively drew connections between the Central Bank Independence (CBI) framework and the experiences of the stagflation era to rationalize their decision to increase interest rates, avoiding the need for a discourse on regime change. In doing so, they recognized the complex trade-offs inherent in balancing various macroeconomic objectives and the challenging decisions they had to face.

It was with this new monetary strategy that the eurozone found itself facing rising inflation in 2021. Recent studies stated that key debate among policymakers centered on whether this inflationary trend would be transitory or permanent. Paul Krugman argued that the current inflationary surge would prove to be transitory, whereas other economists such as Olivier Blanchard and Larry Summers had issued warnings regarding the possible persistence of this inflation. Initially, both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve misjudged the situation, assuming the inflation spike to be temporary and expecting a swift return to their inflation target. This misperception led to the ECB&#x27;s initial inaction regarding its monetary policy.

==== Response to the 2021 inflation crisis ====
After big increases in the inflation rates throughout 2021 and 2022, the European Central Bank and the FED finally decided to raise their interest rates and abandon their very low interest rates, for the first time since the sovereign debt crisis and the end of the CBI era, as it had become clear the inflationary trend wasn&#x27;t temporary. This decision came in late July 2022 for the ECB, when the inflation rate in the eurozone was already at 8.9% and had been higher than the 2% target for more than a year, and in March 2022 for the FED. The European Central Bank&#x27;s response to the Federal Reserve&#x27;s actions can partly be attributed to concerns about imported inflation from the USA. Specifically, if the FED increases its policy rates while the ECB remains static, it could lead to a depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Such a scenario would likely result in higher import costs for the eurozone, as many global trade goods are priced in dollars. On the other hand, this would benefit the US economy by making imports from the eurozone cheaper.

Furthermore, the impact of US dollar appreciation, following the FED&#x27;s policy rate hikes, tends to be more pronounced in the international inflation rates of energy and food. These commodities are commonly priced in US dollars, making their inflation rates more sensitive to exchange rate variations. In the European Union, public inflation expectations are significantly influenced by the prices of energy and food. Thus, this form of imported inflation can further exacerbate overall inflation levels of the eurozone.

The ECB also declared its intention to systematically diminish net asset purchases within their asset purchase program (APP) and end them under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) launched during the COVID crisis by the first trimester of 2022. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve initiated the reduction of its asset purchase program in November 2021, to finally stop it by March 2022. The Asset Purchase Programs of the ECB initially boosted asset values on bank balance sheets and led to expectations of lower future short short-term interest rates. These programs also raised inflation expectations, eventually reanchoring long-term inflation expectations. Phasing out the Asset Purchase Programs thus signals alignment with the different policy rate hikes in an attempt to cool down the economy and demonstrates a commitment to combating inflation.

Research indicates that the European Central Bank responded to the escalating inflation more slowly and cautiously than the FED, showing hopes that a moderate tightening of monetary policy would suffice. The ECB was notably slower in acknowledging the mistaken nature of its initial assumption that the inflationary trend would be transitory. The transition away from extremely low interest rates was soon accompanied by various rate increases, culminating in the ECB&#x27;s main rate reaching 4% by the end of September. In contrast, the FED&#x27;s latest rate hike elevated the Effective Federal Funds Rate to 5.33% in August, underscoring a more aggressive and rapid tightening of monetary policy compared to the ECB&#x27;s approach. However, the global monetary tightening cycle turned out to be the most synchronized one in the past half-century. By February 2023, more than 90% of economies had hiked their policy rates. The latest peak of highly synchronized action by central banks was during the 1970s and the oil prices shocks where 70% of them had raised their interest rates.

==== Critics regarding the new monetary policy ====
Criticism first emerged regarding the methodologies used for inflation estimation and their failure to anticipate the inflation surge. A primary critique focused on the inadequacy of traditional tools like the Phillips Curve, which examines the relationship between inflation and certain economic activity indicators, for accurately forecasting inflation. During the 1970s, the Phillips Curve also faced significant criticism for its inability to accurately predict the inflation experienced in that decade. This period marked a critical reassessment of the curve&#x27;s predictive capacity, particularly in the context of the economic phenomena of the time. Traditional indicators used for forecasting economic dynamics, such as the output and unemployment gaps, were found to be inadequate in signaling the overheating of the economy and the prevailing tight labor market conditions. Moreover, the important belief among central banks that sustained inflationary increases are a consequence of unanchored long-term inflation expectations was challenged during 2021–2022. During this period, inflation expectations remained relatively stable, leading to the misinterpretations by the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities regarding the inflationary trend&#x27;s nature. Both the FED and the ECB argued that the rise in inflation was only temporary and was the sole result of post-pandemic supply disruptions on a few selected goods and services (food and energy). The FED and the ECB then maintained their expansionary monetary policy, keeping interest rates low.

Some critics have also emerged saying that it was complicated for independent central banks, including the ECB, to accurately assess during a synchronized policy rate hike the potential spillovers of cross-countries monetary policy on the inflation. This might lead to excessive monetary tightening (higher interest rates) in unusual circumstances.

Concerns have also been raised about the European Central Bank&#x27;s effectiveness in addressing the recent surge in energy prices. Some experts suggest that the eurozone should be viewed as a small open economy, implying that changes in its demand may not significantly impact global prices. Moreover, they argue that monetary policy might have minimal influence on the global demand for energy. This is because household demand for essentials like heating and transportation is believed to be relatively insensitive to price changes. Additionally, while a stronger euro could theoretically lead to lower import prices, it&#x27;s uncertain whether these savings would be effectively passed on to consumers.

However, recent studies contradict these views by highlighting the significant role of energy prices in the transmission of monetary policy within the eurozone. An increase in the ECB&#x27;s policy rates tends to appreciate the euro against the dollar. This appreciation can lead to higher local energy costs but may also reduce demand, potentially lowering global energy prices. These studies support the ECB&#x27;s decision to follow the Federal Reserve&#x27;s lead in raising policy rates, which appears to have been a strategic move to curb imported inflation and address the spike in energy prices.

==== Effects of the monetary tightening ====
The implementing a of tighter monetary policy has emerged as the eurozone solution to fight the latest inflationary pressure. However, this approach bears the risk of hindering the progress of the economic revival post-COVID. 

Raising interest rates is a strategic move by the ECB with specific aims: to decelerate economic activity, stabilize inflation expectations, and steer towards lower inflation levels. Studies have shown that as interest rates rise, the price on the world market does not really change. However, the Euro becomes more attractive to investors, leading to its appreciation against other currencies. This change benefits households paying for gas in Euros, as it translates into lower prices for dollar-traded oil.

On the other hand, the increase in interest rates, while helping to suppress prices, also places strains on the manufacturing sector and the labor market. The aftermath of this shock sees tighter financing conditions and a dip in demand, resulting in a slight uptick in unemployment rates, going beyond 0.1 percentage points. Although the study shows that manufacturing sector quickly rebounds, returning to its pre-shock state within about three months, the impact on unemployment rates lingers for a longer period.

==Mandate and inflation target==

The ECB has one primary objective – price stability – subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives.

=== Primary mandate ===
The primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. However the EU Treaties do not specify exactly how the ECB should pursue this objective. The European Central Bank has ample discretion over the way it pursues its price stability objective, as it can self-decide on the inflation target, and may also influence the way inflation is being measured.

Since 2021, the ECB has defined its objective as targeting an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. Before that, the precise formulation of the price stability objective has changed over the years:

The Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, &quot;a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%&quot; and added that price stability &quot;was to be maintained over the medium term&quot;. In May 2003, following a thorough review of the ECB&#x27;s monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council clarified that &quot;in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term&quot;. In 2016, the European Central Bank&#x27;s president has further adjusted its communication, by introducing the notion of &quot;symmetry&quot; in its definition of its target, thus making it clear that the ECB should respond both to inflationary pressures and to deflationary pressures. As Draghi once said &quot;symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%.&quot;

On 8 July 2021, as a result of the strategic review led by the new president Christine Lagarde, the ECB officially abandoned the &quot;below but close to two per cent&quot; definition and adopted instead a 2% symmetric target.

=== Secondary mandate ===
Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Treaty (127 TFEU) also provides room for the ECB to pursue other objectives:Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union.This legal provision is often considered to provide a &quot;secondary mandate&quot; to the ECB and offers ample justifications for the ECB to also prioritize other considerations such as full employment or environmental protection, which are mentioned in the Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union. At the same time, economists and commentators are often divided on whether and how the ECB should pursue those secondary objectives, in particular the environmental impact. ECB official have also frequently pointed out the possible contradictions between those secondary objectives. To better guide the ECB&#x27;s action on its secondary objectives, it has been suggested that closer consultation with the European Parliament would be warranted. In 2023, the ECB recognised the possible role of the European Parliament in the prioritisation of its secondary objectives.

===Tasks===

To carry out its main mission, the ECB&#x27;s tasks include:

* Defining and implementing monetary policy
* Managing foreign exchange operations
* Maintaining the payment system to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the T2 payments system and being currently developed technical platform for the settlement of securities in Europe (TARGET2-Securities).
* Consultative role: by law, the ECB&#x27;s opinion is required on any national or EU legislation that falls within the ECB&#x27;s competence.
* Collection and establishment of statistics
* International cooperation 
* Issuing banknotes: the ECB holds the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins). 
* Financial stability and prudential policy
* Banking supervision: since 2013, the ECB has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks.

===Monetary policy tools===
The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements. The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.

All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.

The criteria for determining &quot;high quality&quot; for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to a gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large. Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of the same.
===Difference with US Federal Reserve===
In the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government. There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper. The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for the functioning of the financial system.

The Eurosystem, on the other hand, uses collateralized lending as a default instrument. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term repo contracts. The difference is that banks in effect borrow cash from the ECB and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the number of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank&#x27;s balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman&#x27;s terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted. The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state&#x27;s gross domestic product, are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.

==Organization==
The ECB has four decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECB&#x27;s mandate:
* the Executive Board,
* the Governing Council,
* the General Council,
* the Supervisory Board.

===Decision-making bodies===

====Executive Board====

The Executive Board is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy (defined by the Governing Council) and the day-to-day running of the bank. It can issue decisions to national central banks and may also exercise powers delegated to it by the Governing Council. Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB. The executive board normally meets every Tuesday.

It is composed of the President of the Bank (currently Christine Lagarde), the vice-president (currently Luis de Guindos) and four other members. They are all appointed by the European Council for non-renewable terms of eight years. Members of the executive board of the ECB are appointed &quot;from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB&quot;.

José Manuel González-Páramo, a Spanish member of the executive board since June 2004, was due to leave the board in early June 2012, but no replacement had been named as of late May. The Spanish had nominated Barcelona-born Antonio Sáinz de Vicuña – an ECB veteran who heads its legal department – as González-Páramo&#x27;s replacement as early as January 2012, but alternatives from Luxembourg, Finland, and Slovenia were put forward and no decision made by May. After a long political battle and delays due to the European Parliament&#x27;s protest over the lack of gender balance at the ECB, Luxembourg&#x27;s Yves Mersch was appointed as González-Páramo&#x27;s replacement.

In December 2020, Frank Elderson succeeded to Yves Mersch at the ECB&#x27;s board.

====Governing Council====
The Governing Council is the main decision-making body of the Eurosystem. It comprises the members of the executive board (six in total) and the governors of the National Central Banks of the euro area countries (20 as of 2023).

According to Article 284 of the TFEU, the President of the European Council and a representative from the European Commission may attend the meetings as observers, but they lack voting rights.

Since January 2015, the ECB has published on its website a summary of the Governing Council deliberations (&quot;accounts&quot;). These publications came as a partial response to recurring criticism against the ECB&#x27;s opacity. However, in contrast to other central banks, the ECB still does not disclose individual voting records of the governors seating in its council.

====General Council====
The General Council is a body dealing with transitional issues of euro adoption, for example, fixing the exchange rates of currencies being replaced by the euro (continuing the tasks of the former EMI). It will continue to exist until all EU member states adopt the euro, at which point it will be dissolved. It is composed of the President and vice-president together with the governors of all of the EU&#x27;s national central banks.

====Supervisory Board====
The ECB Supervisory Board meets twice a month to discuss, plan and carry out the ECB&#x27;s supervisory tasks. It proposes draft decisions to the Governing Council under the non-objection procedure. It is composed of Chair (appointed for a non-renewable term of five years), Vice-chair (chosen from among the members of the ECB&#x27;s executive board) four ECB representatives and representatives of national supervisors. If the national supervisory authority designated by a Member State is not a national central bank (NCB), the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their NCB. In such cases, the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure.

It also includes the Steering Committee, which supports the activities of the supervisory board and prepares the Board&#x27;s meetings. It is composed by the chair of the supervisory board, Vice-chair of the supervisory board, one ECB representative and five representatives of national supervisors. The five representatives of national supervisors are appointed by the supervisory board for one year based on a rotation system that ensures a fair representation of countries.

The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its initial capital was supposed to be €5 billion and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states&#x27; populations and GDP, but the key is adjustable. The euro area NCBs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ECB&#x27;s capital in full. The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECB&#x27;s capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under €4 billion. The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral. The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB.

Today, ECB capital is about €11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. The NCBs&#x27; shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member&#x27;s share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU. The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing NCBs changes. The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission.

All national central banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below. Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital.


===Reserves===
In addition to capital subscriptions, the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40 billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB&#x27;s subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in US dollars and UK pounds sterling.

===Languages===
The internal working language of the ECB is English, and press conferences are held in English. External communications are handled flexibly: English is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the ESCB (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ECB website is predominantly English; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU (generally English, German and French).

In 2022, the ECB publishes for the first time details on the nationality of its staff, revealing an over-representation of Germans and Italians along the ECB employees, including in management positions.

===Independence===
The European Central Bank (and by extension, the Eurosystem) is often considered as the &quot;most independent central bank in the world&quot;. In general terms, this means that the Eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed, designed, decided and implemented in full autonomy, without pressure or need for instructions from any external body. The main justification for the ECB&#x27;s independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability.

In practice, the ECB&#x27;s independence is pinned by four key principles:

* Operational and legal independence: the ECB has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion. The ECB&#x27;s governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB&#x27;s own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be the party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. 
* Personal independence: the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years. In addition, ECB board members are vastly immune from judicial proceedings. Indeed, removals from the office can only be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), under the request of the ECB&#x27;s Governing Council or the executive board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such a decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem&#x27;s national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with a possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.
* Financial independence: the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB&#x27;s financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct monetary financing of public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.
*Political independence: The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB&#x27;s independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.

===Democratic accountability===
In return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament (and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)). Although the accountability mechanisms are not enshrined in EU law, several practices were established following a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998, which were informally agreed by the ECB, and incorporated into the Parliament&#x27;s rule of procedure. In 2023, the European Parliament and the ECB made these accountability arrangements were made more formal by signing an exchange of letter.

The accountability framework involves five main mechanisms:

* Annual report: the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Council . The report is presented to the European parliament at the occasion of a specific hearing with the ECB&#x27;s vice-president at the ECON committee.
* Annual parliamentary resolution: in return, the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its own annual resolution on the European Central Bank&#x27;s report (which is essentially a non-legally-binding list of resolutions). Since 2016, the ECB replies to the Parliament&#x27;s suggestions in an annex to its annual report.
* Quarterly hearings (known as the &quot;Monetary Dialogue&quot;): the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament organises a hearing with the ECB every quarter, allowing members of parliament to address oral questions to the ECB president.
* Parliamentary questions: all Members of the European Parliament have the right to address written questions to the ECB president. The ECB president provides a written answer in about six weeks.
* Appointments: The European Parliament is consulted during the appointment process of executive board members of the ECB. However the Parliament&#x27;s vote is only consultative, and in practice, the Parliament&#x27;s opinion – when negative – has been ignored by the European Council.
* Legal proceedings: the ECB&#x27;s legal personality allows civil society or public institutions to file complaints against the ECB to the Court of Justice of the EU.

In 2013, an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ECB and the European Parliament in the context of the establishment of the ECB&#x27;s Banking Supervision. This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECB&#x27;s activities. For example, under the agreement, the Parliament can veto the appointment of the chair and vice-chair of the ECB&#x27;s supervisory board and may approve removals if requested by the ECB.

=== Transparency ===
In addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by Transparency International, &quot;The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU&#x27;s transparency principles &quot;only when exercising [its] administrative tasks&quot; (the exemption – which leaves the term &quot;administrative tasks&quot; undefined – equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank).

In practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:
* Voting secrecy: while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB&#x27;s Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014, the ECB has published &quot;accounts&quot; of its monetary policy meetings, but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.
* Access to documents: The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB&#x27;s Rules of Procedure, the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30 years.
* Disclosure of securities: The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE.

==Location==

The bank is based in Ostend (East End), Frankfurt am Main. The city is the largest financial centre in the Eurozone and the bank&#x27;s location in it is fixed by the Amsterdam Treaty. The bank moved to a new purpose-built headquarters in 2014, designed by a Vienna-based architectural office, Coop Himmelbau. The building is approximately tall and is to be accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main. The main construction on a 120,000 m2 total site area began in October 2008, and it was expected that the building would become an architectural symbol for Europe. While it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operated in the former Eurotower, that building has been retained by the ECB, owing to more space being required since it took responsibility for banking supervision.

== Debates surrounding the ECB ==
=== Debates on ECB independence ===

The debate on the independence of the ECB finds its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU. The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroup.

==== Arguments in favour of independence ====
There is strong consensus among economists on the value of central bank independence from politics. The rationale behind are both empirical and theoretical. On the theoretical side, it&#x27;s believed that time inconsistency suggests the existence of political business cycles where elected officials might take advantage of policy surprises to secure reelection. The politician up to the election will therefore be incentivized to introduce expansionary monetary policies, reducing unemployment in the short run. These effects will be most likely temporary. By contrast, in the long run, it will increase inflation, with unemployment returning to the natural rate negating the positive effect. Furthermore, the credibility of the central bank will deteriorate, making it more difficult to answer the market. Additionally, empirical work has been done that defined and measured central bank independence (CBI), looking at the relationship of CBI with inflation.

==== The arguments against too much independence ====

===== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. =====
According to Christopher Adolph, the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal façade and not an indisputable fact.

The crisis: an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers:

– &quot;Its participation in the troika&quot;: Thanks to its three factors which explain its independence, the ECB took advantage of this crisis to implement, through its participation in the troika, the famous structural reforms in the Member States aimed at making, more flexible the various markets, particularly the labour market, which are still considered too rigid under the ordoliberal concept.

- &quot;Macro-prudential supervision&quot; : At the same time, taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system, the Frankfurt Bank has acquired new responsibilities, such as macro-prudential supervision, in other words, supervision of the provision of financial services.

-&quot;Take liberties with its mandate to save the Euro&quot; : Paradoxically, the crisis undermined the ECB&#x27;s ordoliberal discourse &quot;because some of its instruments, which it had to implement, deviated significantly from its principles. It then interpreted the paradigm with enough flexibly to adapt its original reputation to these new economic conditions. It was forced to do so as a last resort to save its one and only raison d&#x27;être: the euro. This Independent was thus obliged to be pragmatic by departing from the spirit of its statutes, which is unacceptable to the hardest supporters of ordoliberalism, which will lead to the resignation of the two German leaders present within the ECB: the governor of the Bundesbank, Jens WEIDMANN and the member of the executive board of the ECB, Jürgen STARK.

– &quot;Regulation of the financial system&quot; : The delegation of this new function to the ECB was carried out with great simplicity and with the consent of European leaders, because neither the Commission nor the Member States really wanted to obtain the monitoring of financial abuses throughout the area. In other words, in the event of a new financial crisis, the ECB would be the perfect scapegoat.

- &quot;Capturing exchange rate policy&quot; : The event that will most mark the definitive politicization of the ECB is, of course, the operation launched in January 2015: the quantitative easing (QE) operation. Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States&#x27; public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.

In conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers.

===== The arguments in favour of a counter power =====
In the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. According to him, this transparency could bring several advantages as the improvement of efficiency and credibility by giving the public adequate information. Others think that the ECB should have a closer relationship with the European Parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ECB. The development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed:

Towards democratic institutions ?

The absence of democratic institutions such as a Parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ECB in its management of the euro area, and many proposals have been made in this respect, particularly after the economic crisis, which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area. For Moïse Sidiropoulos, a professor in economy: &quot;The crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise, because the euro remains an unfinished currency, a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy&quot;.

French economist Thomas Piketty wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the eurozone with democratic institutions. An economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget, common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities. Such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the Eurogroup.

Nevertheless, according to him &quot;there is no point in talking about a government of the eurozone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable&quot;, a real parliament of the eurozone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist, who also denounces the lack of action in this area.

The creation of a sub-committee within the current European Parliament was also mentioned, in the model of the Eurogroup, which is currently an under-formation of the ECOFIN Committee. This would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies. The former President of the European Commission had, moreover, stated on this subject that he had &quot;no sympathy for the idea of a specific Eurozone Parliament&quot;.

==== Debates on the role of central bank reserves in monetary policy ====
In &quot;Towards monetary policies that do not subsidise banks&quot; published in July 2023 and co-authored with Yuemei Ji, Paul de Grauwe criticizes the prevailing role of central bank reserves in monetary policy. Holding the John Paulson Chair in European Political Economy at the London School of Economics, de Grauwe presented his views on this matter in a lecture at the Bundesbank in September 2023.

De Grauwe states that major central banks are currently operating in a regime of abundance of bank reserves. This abundance, he argues, is a consequence of massive government bond-buying programs and a fundamental change in the operating procedures of these central banks. Since late 2021, in response to rising interest rates aimed at combating inflation, central banks have adopted a procedure of increasing interest rates by raising the remuneration on bank reserves. This approach has resulted in substantial interest payments to commercial banks. Due to past Quantitative Easing, bank reserves are now massive, leading to huge transfers of profits. Paul de Grauwe highlights the magnitude of these interest payments, comparing them to significant public expenditures:  the interests received by commercial banks to the yearly spending of the EU (€165 billion) to the interest payments of the ECB during the same period (€152 billion).

De Grauwe argues that these transfers lack economic rationale. Despite seigniorage gains traditionally returning to the government, he observes that central banks are transferring more than the total seigniorage gains to private banks, resulting in significant losses and effectively constituting a subsidy to banks at the expense of taxpayers.

Furthermore, the author raises concerns about moral hazard, noting that the provision of free interest hedging for banks by central banks may create ethical issues, as public authorities offer free insurance to private agents.

Questioning the economic rationale for these practices, de Grauwe states that the remuneration of bank reserves is not totally necessary for conducting monetary policy and that the regime of reserve abundance is a result of the oversupply of reserves created by central banks through the buying of large amounts of government bonds. Now, central banks cannot raise the interest rate without remunerating bank reserves, the equilibrium of demand (commercial blanks) and supply (central banks) being under the 0% rate. De Grauwe also states that the reserve abundance regime has altered the view of economists on the role of central banks : money base created by the central bank is now viewed as part of the public debt since central banks must pay a rate of remuneration on bank reserves. According to de Grauwe, this view is not inevitable and he suggests alternative operating procedures to address these issues : a gradual return to a regime of scarce reserves through Quantitative Tightening, raising minimum reserve requirements without paying interest on bank reserves, and implementing a two-tier system of reserve requirements to control the market rate while reducing transfers to commercial banks.

Policymakers at the European Central Bank are split on the economic outlook, with some worried about a looming recession and others focused on inflation pressures. This disagreement is likely to impact future decisions on interest rate cuts, with one side advocating for faster cuts due to economic concerns, while the other prefers a cautious approach to ensure inflation remains under control.
