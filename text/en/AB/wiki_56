<text>Daniel Defoe (; born Daniel Foe; 1660 – 24 April 1731) was an English writer, merchant and spy. He is most famous for his novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, published in 1719, which is claimed to be second only to the Bible in its number of translations. He has been seen as one of the earliest proponents of the English novel, and helped to popularise the form in Britain with others such as Aphra Behn and Samuel Richardson. Defoe wrote many political tracts, was often in trouble with the authorities, and spent a period in prison. Intellectuals and political leaders paid attention to his fresh ideas and sometimes consulted him.

Defoe was a prolific and versatile writer, producing more than three hundred works—books, pamphlets, and journals—on diverse topics, including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology and the supernatural. He was also a pioneer of business journalism and economic journalism.

== Early life ==
Daniel Foe was probably born in Fore Street in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, London. Defoe later added the aristocratic-sounding &quot;De&quot; to his name, and on occasion made the false claim of descent from a family named De Beau Faux. &quot;De&quot; is also a common prefix in Flemish surnames. His birthdate and birthplace are uncertain, and sources offer dates from 1659 to 1662, with the summer or early autumn of 1660 considered the most likely. His father, James Foe, was a prosperous tallow chandler of probable Flemish descent, and a member of the Worshipful Company of Butchers. In Defoe&#x27;s early childhood, he lived through several significant historical events: in 1665, seventy thousand were killed by the Great Plague of London, and the next year, the Great Fire of London left only Defoe&#x27;s and two other houses standing in his neighbourhood. In 1667, when he was probably about seven, a Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway via the River Thames and attacked the town of Chatham in the raid on the Medway. His mother, Alice, had died by the time he was about ten.

=== Education ===
Defoe was educated at the Rev. James Fisher&#x27;s boarding school in Pixham Lane in Dorking, Surrey. His parents were Presbyterian dissenters, and around the age of 14, he was sent to Charles Morton&#x27;s dissenting academy at Newington Green, then a village just north of London, where he is believed to have attended the Dissenting church there. He lived on Church Street, Stoke Newington, at what is now nos. 95–103. During this period, the English government persecuted those who chose to worship outside the established Church of England.

== Business career ==
Defoe entered the world of business as a general merchant, dealing at different times in hosiery, general woollen goods, and wine. His ambitions were great and he was able to buy a country estate and a ship (as well as civets to make perfume), though he was rarely out of debt. On 1 January 1684, Defoe married Mary Tuffley at St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate. She was the daughter of a London merchant, and brought with her a dowry of £3,700—a huge amount by the standards of the day. Given his debts and political difficulties, the marriage may have been troubled, but it lasted 47 years and produced eight children.

In 1685, Defoe joined the ill-fated Monmouth Rebellion but gained a pardon, by which he escaped the Bloody Assizes of Judge George Jeffreys. Queen Mary and her husband William III were jointly crowned in 1689, and Defoe became one of William&#x27;s close allies and a secret agent. Some of the new policies led to conflict with France, thus damaging prosperous trade relationships for Defoe. In 1692, he was arrested for debts of £700 and, in the face of total debts that may have amounted to £17,000, was forced to declare bankruptcy. He died with little wealth and evidently embroiled in lawsuits with the royal treasury.

Following his release from debtors&#x27; prison, he probably travelled in Europe and Scotland, and it may have been at this time that he traded wine to Cadiz, Porto and Lisbon. By 1695, he was back in England, now formally using the name &quot;Defoe&quot; and serving as a &quot;commissioner of the glass duty&quot;, responsible for collecting taxes on bottles. In 1696, he ran a tile and brick factory in what is now Tilbury in Essex and lived in the parish of Chadwell St Mary nearby.

== Writing ==
As many as 545 titles have been attributed to Defoe, including satirical poems, political and religious pamphlets, and volumes.

=== Pamphleteering and prison ===
Defoe&#x27;s first notable publication was &quot;An Essay Upon Projects&quot;, a series of proposals for social and economic improvement, published in 1697. From 1697 to 1698, he defended the right of King William III to a standing army during disarmament, after the Treaty of Ryswick (1697) had ended the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697). His most successful poem, &quot;The True-Born Englishman&quot; (1701), defended William against xenophobic attacks from his political enemies in England, and English anti-immigration sentiments more generally. In 1701, Defoe presented the &quot;Legion&#x27;s Memorial&quot; to Robert Harley, then Speaker of the House of Commons—and his subsequent employer—while flanked by a guard of sixteen gentlemen of quality. It demanded the release of the Kentish petitioners, who had asked Parliament to support the king in an imminent war against France.

The death of William III in 1702 once again created a political upheaval, as the king was replaced by Queen Anne who immediately began her offensive against Nonconformists. Defoe was a natural target, and his pamphleteering and political activities resulted in his arrest and placement in a pillory on 31 July 1703, principally on account of his December 1702 pamphlet entitled &quot;The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church&quot;, purporting to argue for their extermination. In it, he ruthlessly satirised both the high church Tories and those Dissenters who hypocritically practised so-called &quot;occasional conformity&quot;, such as his Stoke Newington neighbour Sir Thomas Abney. It was published anonymously, but the true authorship was quickly discovered and Defoe was arrested. He was charged with seditious libel and found guilty in a trial at the Old Bailey in front of the notoriously sadistic judge Salathiel Lovell. Lovell sentenced him to a punitive fine of 200 marks (£336 then, £ in 2025), to public humiliation in a pillory, and to an indeterminate length of imprisonment which would only end upon the discharge of the punitive fine. According to legend, the publication of his poem &quot;Hymn to the Pillory&quot; caused his audience at the pillory to throw flowers instead of the customary harmful and noxious objects and to drink to his health. The truth of this story is questioned by most scholars, although John Robert Moore later said that &quot;no man in England but Defoe ever stood in the pillory and later rose to eminence among his fellow men&quot;.
After his three days in the pillory, Defoe went into Newgate Prison. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, brokered his release in exchange for Defoe&#x27;s cooperation as an intelligence agent for the Tories. In exchange for such cooperation with the rival political side, Harley paid some of Defoe&#x27;s outstanding debts, improving his financial situation considerably.

Within a week of his release from prison, Defoe witnessed the Great Storm of 1703, which raged through the night of 26/27 November. It caused severe damage to London and Bristol, uprooted millions of trees, and killed more than 8,000 people, mostly at sea. The event became the subject of Defoe&#x27;s &quot;The Storm&quot; (1704), which includes a collection of witness accounts of the tempest. Many regard it as one of the world&#x27;s first examples of modern journalism.

In the same year, he set up his periodical &quot;A Review of the Affairs of France&quot;, which supported the Harley Ministry, chronicling the events of the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1714). The &quot;Review&quot; ran three times a week without interruption until 1713. Defoe was amazed that a man as gifted as Harley left vital state papers lying in the open, and warned that he was almost inviting an unscrupulous clerk to commit treason; his warnings were fully justified by the William Gregg affair.

When Harley was ousted from the ministry in 1708, Defoe continued writing the &quot;Review&quot; to support Godolphin, then again to support Harley and the Tories in the Tory ministry of 1710–1714. The Tories fell from power with the death of Queen Anne, but Defoe continued doing intelligence work for the Whig government, writing &quot;Tory&quot; pamphlets that undermined the Tory point of view.

Not all of Defoe&#x27;s pamphlet writing was political. One pamphlet was originally published anonymously, entitled &quot;A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs. Veal the Next Day after her Death to One Mrs. Bargrave at Canterbury The 8th of September, 1705&quot;. It deals with the interaction between the spiritual realm and the physical realm and was most likely written in support of Charles Drelincourt&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Defence against the Fears of Death&quot; (1651). It describes Mrs. Bargrave&#x27;s encounter with her old friend Mrs. Veal after she had died. It is clear from this piece and other writings that the political portion of Defoe&#x27;s life was by no means his only focus.

=== Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 ===

In despair during his imprisonment for the seditious libel case, Defoe wrote to William Paterson, the London Scot and founder of the Bank of England and part instigator of the Darien scheme, who was in the confidence of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, leading minister and spymaster in the English government. Harley accepted Defoe&#x27;s services and released him in 1703. He immediately published &quot;The Review&quot;, which appeared weekly, then three times a week, written mostly by himself. This was the main mouthpiece of the English Government promoting the Act of Union 1707.

Defoe began his campaign in &quot;The Review&quot; and other pamphlets aimed at English opinion, claiming that it would end the threat from the north, gaining for the Treasury an &quot;inexhaustible treasury of men&quot;, a valuable new market increasing the power of England. By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to Edinburgh as a secret agent, and to secure acquiescence by using &quot;underhand methods to predispose Scots&#x27; opinion in favour of&quot; the Treaty of Union. He was conscious of the risk to himself. Thanks to books such as &quot;The Letters of Daniel Defoe&quot; (edited by G. H. Healey, Oxford 1955), far more is known about his activities than is usual with such agents.

His first reports included vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. &quot;A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind&quot;, he reported. Defoe reportedly &quot;became fearful of being lynched after a threatening crowd surged up the High Street shouting &#x27;No Union! No English dogs!&#x27;&quot; Years later John Clerk of Penicuik, a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin: 

Defoe was a Presbyterian who had suffered in England for his convictions, and as such he was accepted as an adviser to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and committees of the Parliament of Scotland. He told Harley that he was &quot;privy to all their folly&quot; but &quot;Perfectly unsuspected as with corresponding with anybody in England&quot;. He was then able to influence the proposals that were put to Parliament and reported,

For Scotland, he used different arguments, even the opposite of those which he used in England, usually ignoring the English doctrine of the Sovereignty of Parliament, for example, telling the Scots that they could have complete confidence in the guarantees in the Treaty. Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion of the time. The same is true of a massive history of the Union which Defoe published in 1709 and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works. Defoe took pains to give his history an air of objectivity by giving some space to arguments against the Union, but always kept the last word for himself.

He disposed of the main Union opponent, Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, by ignoring him. Nor does he account for the deviousness of the Duke of Hamilton, the official leader of the various factions opposed to the Union, who seemingly betrayed his former colleagues when he switched to the Unionist/Government side in the decisive final stages of the debate.

==== Aftermath ====
In 1709, Defoe authored a lengthy book entitled &quot;The History of the Union of Great Britain&quot;, an Edinburgh publication printed by the Heirs of Anderson. Defoe is cited twice in the book as its author, and gives details of the events leading up to the &quot;Acts of Union 1707&quot;, dating as far back as 6 December 1604, when King James I was presented with a proposal for unification. This so-called &quot;first draft&quot; for unification took place just a little over 100 years before the signing of the 1707 accord.

Defoe made no attempt to explain why the same Parliament of Scotland which was so vehemently in favour of remaining independent from 1703 to 1705 became so supine in 1706. He received very little reward from his paymasters and no recognition for his services by the government. He made use of his Scottish experience to write his &quot;Tour thro&#x27; the whole Island of Great Britain&quot;, published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union was &quot;not the case, but rather the contrary&quot;.
Defoe&#x27;s description of Glasgow (Glaschu) as a &quot;Dear Green Place&quot; has often been misquoted as a Gaelic translation for the town&#x27;s name. The Gaelic &quot;Glas&quot; could mean grey or green, while &quot;chu&quot; means dog or hollow. &quot;Glaschu&quot; probably means &quot;Green Hollow&quot;. The &quot;Dear Green Place&quot;, like much of Scotland, was a hotbed of unrest against the Union. The local Tron minister urged his congregation &quot;to up and anent for the City of God&quot;.

The &quot;Dear Green Place&quot; and &quot;City of God&quot; required government troops to put down the rioters tearing up copies of the Treaty at almost every mercat cross in Scotland. When Defoe visited in the mid-1720s, he claimed that the hostility towards his party was &quot;because they were English and because of the Union, which they were almost universally exclaimed against&quot;.

=== Late writing ===
The extent and particulars are widely contested concerning Defoe&#x27;s writing in the period from the Tory fall in 1714 to the publication of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; in 1719. Defoe comments on the tendency to attribute tracts of uncertain authorship to him in his apologia &quot;Appeal to Honour and Justice&quot; (1715), a defence of his part in Harley&#x27;s Tory ministry (1710–1714). Other works that anticipate his novelistic career include &quot;The Family Instructor&quot; (1715), a conduct manual on religious duty; &quot;Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager&quot; (1717), in which he impersonates Nicolas Mesnager, the French plenipotentiary who negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht (1713); and &quot;A Continuation of the Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy&quot; (1718), a satire of European politics and religion, ostensibly written by a Muslim in Paris.

From 1719 to 1724, Defoe published the novels for which he is famous (see below). In the final decade of his life, he also wrote conduct manuals, including &quot;Religious Courtship&quot; (1722), &quot;The Complete English Tradesman&quot; (1726) and &quot;The New Family Instructor&quot; (1727). He published a number of books decrying the breakdown of the social order, such as &quot;The Great Law of Subordination Considered&quot; (1724) and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Business is Nobody&#x27;s Business&quot; (1725) and works on the supernatural, like &quot;The Political History of the Devil&quot; (1726), &quot;A System of Magick&quot; (1727) and &quot;An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions&quot; (1727). His works on foreign travel and trade include &quot;A General History of Discoveries and Improvements&quot; (1727) and &quot;Atlas Maritimus and Commercialis&quot; (1728). Perhaps his most significant work, apart from the novels, is &quot;A Tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; (1724–1727), which provided a panoramic survey of British trade on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.

==== &quot;The Complete English Tradesman&quot; ====
Published in 1726, &quot;The Complete English Tradesman&quot; is an example of Defoe&#x27;s political works. In the work, Defoe discussed the role of the tradesman in England in comparison to tradesmen internationally, arguing that the British system of trade is far superior. Defoe also implied that trade was the backbone of the British economy: &quot;estate&#x27;s a pond, but trade&#x27;s a spring.&quot; In the work, Defoe praised the practicality of trade not only within the economy but the social stratification as well. Defoe argued that most of the British gentry was at one time or another inextricably linked with the institution of trade, either through personal experience, marriage or genealogy. Oftentimes younger members of noble families entered into trade, and marriages to a tradesman&#x27;s daughter by a nobleman was also common. Overall, Defoe demonstrated a high respect for tradesmen, being one himself.

Not only did Defoe elevate individual British tradesmen to the level of gentleman, but he praised the entirety of British trade as a superior system to other systems of trade. Trade, Defoe argues, is a much better catalyst for social and economic change than war. Defoe also argued that through the expansion of the British Empire and British mercantile influence, Britain would be able to &quot;increase commerce at home&quot; through job creations and increased consumption. He wrote in the work that increased consumption, by laws of supply and demand, increases production and in turn raises wages for the poor therefore lifting part of British society further out of poverty.

=== Novels ===
==== &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; ====

Published when Defoe was in his late fifties, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; relates the story of a man&#x27;s shipwreck on a desert island for twenty-eight years and his subsequent adventures. Throughout its episodic narrative, Crusoe&#x27;s struggles with faith are apparent as he bargains with God in times of life-threatening crises, but time and again he turns his back after his deliverances. He is finally content with his lot in life, separated from society, following a more genuine conversion experience.

In the opening pages of &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;, the author describes how Crusoe settled in Bedfordshire, married and produced a family, and that when his wife died, he went off on these further adventures. Bedford is also the place where the brother of &quot;H. F.&quot; in &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; retired to avoid the danger of the plague, so that by implication, if these works were not fiction, Defoe&#x27;s family met Crusoe in Bedford, from whence the information in these books was gathered. Defoe went to school in Newington Green with a friend named Caruso.

The novel has been assumed to be based in part on the story of the Scottish castaway Alexander Selkirk, who spent four years stranded in the Juan Fernández Islands, but his experience is inconsistent with the details of the narrative. The island Selkirk lived on, Más a Tierra (Closer to Land) was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. It has also been supposed that Defoe may have also been inspired by a translation of a book by the Andalusian-Arab Muslim polymath Ibn Tufail, who was known as &quot;Abubacer&quot; in Europe. The Latin edition was entitled &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;; Simon Ockley published an English translation in 1708, entitled &quot;The improvement of human reason, exhibited in the life of Hai ebn Yokdhan&quot;.

==== &quot;Captain Singleton&quot; ====
Defoe&#x27;s next novel was &quot;Captain Singleton&quot; (1720), an adventure story whose first half covers a traversal of Africa which anticipated subsequent discoveries by David Livingstone and whose second half taps into the contemporary fascination with piracy. The novel has been commended for its sensitive depiction of the close relationship between the hero and his religious mentor, Quaker William Walters. Its description of the geography of Africa and some of its fauna does not use the language or knowledge of a fiction writer and suggests an eyewitness experience.

==== &quot;Memoirs of a Cavalier&quot; ====
&quot;Memoirs of a Cavalier&quot; (1720) is set during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the English Civil War.

==== &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; ====
&quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot;, published in 1722, can be read both as novel and as nonfiction. It is an account of the Great Plague of London in 1665, which is undersigned by the initials &quot;H. F.&quot;, suggesting the author&#x27;s uncle Henry Foe as its primary source. It is a historical account of the events based on extensive research and written as if by an eyewitness, even though Defoe was only about five years old when it occurred.

==== &quot;Colonel Jack&quot; ====
&quot;Colonel Jack&quot; (1722) follows an orphaned boy from a life of poverty and crime to prosperity in the colonies, military and marital imbroglios, and religious conversion, driven by a problematic notion of becoming a &quot;gentleman.&quot;

==== &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; ====
Also in 1722, Defoe wrote &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, another first-person picaresque novel of the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England. The titular heroine appears as a whore, bigamist and thief, lives in The Mint, commits adultery and incest, and yet manages to retain the reader&#x27;s sympathy. Her savvy manipulation of both men and wealth earns her a life of trials but ultimately an ending in reward. Although Moll struggles with the morality of some of her actions and decisions, religion seems to be far from her concerns throughout most of her story. However, like Robinson Crusoe, she finally repents. &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; is an important work in the development of the novel, as it challenged the common perception of femininity and gender roles in 18th-century British society. Although it was not intended as a work of erotica, later generations came to view it as such.

==== &quot;Roxana&quot; ====
Defoe&#x27;s final novel, &quot;&quot; (1724), which narrates the moral and spiritual decline of a high society courtesan, differs from other Defoe works because the main character does not exhibit a conversion experience, even though she claims to be a penitent later in her life, at the time that she is relating her story.

==== Patterns ====
In Defoe&#x27;s writings, especially in his fiction, are traits that can be seen across his works. Defoe was well known for his didacticism, with most of his works aiming to convey a message of some kind to the readers (typically a moral one, stemming from his religious background). Connected to Defoe&#x27;s didacticism is his use of the genre of spiritual autobiography, particularly in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Another common feature of Defoe&#x27;s fictional works is that he claimed they were true stories of their subjects.

=== Attribution and de-attribution ===
Defoe is known to have used at least 198 pen names. It was a very common practice in eighteenth-century novel publishing to initially publish works under a pen name, with most other authors at the time publishing their works anonymously. As a result of the anonymous ways in which most of his works were published, it has been a challenge for scholars over the years to properly credit Defoe for all of the works that he wrote in his lifetime. If counting only works that Defoe published under his own name, or his known pen name &quot;the author of the True-Born Englishman,&quot; there would be about 75 works that could be attributed to him.

Beyond these 75 works, scholars have used a variety of strategies to determine what other works should be attributed to Defoe. Writer George Chalmers was the first to begin the work of attributing anonymously published works to Defoe. In &quot;History of the Union&quot;, he created an expanded list with over a hundred titles that he attributed to Defoe, alongside twenty additional works that he designated as &quot;Books which are supposed to be De Foe&#x27;s.&quot; Chalmers included works in his canon of Defoe that were particularly in line with his style and way of thinking, and ultimately attributed 174 works to Defoe. Many of the attributions of Defoe&#x27;s novels came long after his death. Notably, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; and &quot;Roxana&quot; were published anonymously for over fifty years until Francis Noble named Daniel Defoe on their title pages in edition publication in 1775 and 1774.

Biographer P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens built upon this canon, also relying on what they believed could be Defoe&#x27;s work, without a means to be absolutely certain. In the &quot;Cambridge History of English Literature&quot;, the section on Defoe by author William P. Trent attributes 370 works to Defoe. J.R. Moore generated the largest list of Defoe&#x27;s work, with approximately five hundred and fifty works that he attributed to Defoe.

== Death ==
Defoe died on 24 April 1731, in Ropemakers Alley, not far from where he was born in Cripplegate, probably while in hiding from his creditors. He was often in debtors&#x27; prison. The cause of his death was labelled as lethargy, but he probably experienced a stroke. He was interred in Bunhill Fields (today Bunhill Fields Burial and Gardens), just outside the medieval boundaries of the City of London, in what is now the Borough of Islington, where a monument was erected to his memory in 1870. A street in the Bronx, New York, is named in his honour (De Foe Place).

<text>Desmond John Morris FLS &quot;hon. caus.&quot; (born 24 January 1928) is an English zoologist, ethologist and surrealist painter, as well as a popular author in human sociobiology. He is known for his 1967 book &quot;The Naked Ape&quot;, and for his television programmes such as &quot;Zoo Time&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Morris was born in Purton, Wiltshire, to Marjorie (née Hunt) and children&#x27;s fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to Swindon where Desmond developed an interest in natural history and writing. He was educated at Dauntsey&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Wiltshire.

In 1946, Morris joined the British Army for two years of national service, becoming a lecturer in fine arts at the Chiseldon Army College in Wiltshire. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the Swindon Arts Centre, and studied zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with Joan Miró at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years. Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, &quot;Time Flower&quot; and &quot;The Butterfly and the Pin&quot;. In 1951 he began a doctorate at the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, in animal behaviour. In 1954, he earned a Doctor of Philosophy for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the ten-spined stickleback.

==Career==
Morris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the Granada TV and Film Unit for the Zoological Society of London, and studied the picture-making abilities of apes. The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV&#x27;s weekly &quot;Zoo Time&quot; programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show &quot;Life in the Animal World&quot; for BBC2. In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by common chimpanzees. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, &quot;The Lost Image&quot;, which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. In 1959 he left &quot;Zoo Time&quot; to become the Zoological Society&#x27;s Curator of Mammals. In 1964, he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;Animal Behaviour&quot;. In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London Institute of Contemporary Arts.

Morris&#x27;s books include &quot;The Naked Ape: A Zoologist&#x27;s Study of the Human Animal&quot;, published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to Malta in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist Niko Tinbergen. From 1973 to 1981, Morris was a Research Fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford. In 1979 he undertook a television series for Thames TV, &quot;The Human Race&quot;, followed in 1982 by &quot;Man Watching in Japan&quot;, &quot;The Animals Road Show&quot; in 1986 and then several other series. Morris wrote and presented the BBC documentary &quot;The Human Animal&quot; and its accompanying book in 1994. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/16) with Morris, in 2015, for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.

Morris is a Fellow &quot;honoris causa&quot; of the Linnean Society of London.

==Personal life==
Morris&#x27;s father suffered lung damage in World War I, and died when Morris was 14. He was not allowed to go to the funeral and said later; &quot;It was the beginning of a lifelong hatred of the establishment. The church, the government and the military were all on my hate list and have remained there ever since.&quot; His grandfather William Morris, an enthusiastic Victorian naturalist and founder of the Swindon local newspaper, greatly influenced him during his time living in Swindon.

In July 1952, Morris married Ramona Baulch; they had one son, Jason. In 1978 Morris was elected vice-chairman of Oxford United. While a director of the club, he designed its ox-head badge based on a Minoan-style bull&#x27;s head, which remains in use to this day.

Morris lived in the same house in North Oxford as the 19th-century lexicographer James Murray who worked on the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. He has exhibited at the Taurus Gallery in North Parade, Oxford, close to where he lived. He is the patron of the Friends of Swindon Museum and Art Gallery and gave a talk to launch the charity in 1993. Since the death of his wife in 2018 he has lived with his son and family in Ireland.

== Criticism ==
Some of Morris&#x27;s theories have been criticised as untestable. For instance, geneticist Adam Rutherford writes that Morris commits &quot;the scientific sin of the &#x27;just-so&#x27; story – speculation that sounds appealing but cannot be tested or is devoid of evidence&quot;. However, this is also a criticism of adaptationism in evolutionary biology, not just of Morris.

Morris is also criticised for suggesting that gender roles have an evolutionary rather than a purely cultural background.

<doc id="8199" wikidata="Q448" url="?curid=8199" title="Denis Diderot">
<text>Denis Diderot (; ; 5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer, best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the along with Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. He was a prominent figure during the Age of Enlightenment.

Diderot initially studied philosophy at a Jesuit college, then considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734, his father disowned him. He lived a bohemian existence for the next decade. In the 1740s he wrote many of his best-known works in both fiction and non-fiction, including the 1748 novel &quot;Les Bijoux indiscrets&quot; (The Indiscreet Jewels).

In 1751 Diderot co-created the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; with Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. It was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors and the first to describe the mechanical arts. Its secular tone, which included articles skeptical about Biblical miracles, angered both religious and government authorities; in 1758 it was banned by the Catholic Church and, in 1759, the French government banned it as well, although this ban was not strictly enforced. Many of the initial contributors to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; left the project as a result of its controversies and some were even jailed. D&#x27;Alembert left in 1759, making Diderot the sole editor. Diderot also became the main contributor, writing around 7,000 articles. He continued working on the project until 1765. He was increasingly despondent about the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; by the end of his involvement in it and felt that the entire project might have been a waste. Nevertheless, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; is considered one of the forerunners of the French Revolution.

Diderot struggled financially throughout most of his career and received very little official recognition of his merit, including being passed over for membership in the Académie Française. His fortunes improved significantly in 1766, when Empress Catherine the Great, who had heard of his financial troubles, generously bought his 3,000-volume personal library, amassed during his work on the Encyclopédie, for 15,000 livres, and offered him in addition a thousand more livres per year to serve as its custodian while he lived. He received 50 years&#x27; &quot;salary&quot; up front from her, and stayed five months at her court in Saint Petersburg in 1773 and 1774, sharing discussions and writing essays on various topics for her several times a week.

Diderot&#x27;s literary reputation during his life rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;; many of his most important works, including &quot;Jacques the Fatalist&quot;, &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, &quot;Paradox of the Actor&quot;, and &quot;D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Dream&quot;, were published only after his death.
==Early life==

Denis Diderot was born in Langres, Champagne. His parents were Didier Diderot, a cutler, &quot;maître coutelier&quot;, and Angélique Vigneron. Of Denis&#x27; five siblings, three survived to adulthood: Denise Diderot, their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot and, their sister Angélique Diderot. Denis Diderot greatly admired his sister Denise, sometimes referring to her as &quot;a female Socrates&quot;.

Diderot began his formal education at a Jesuit college in Langres. In 1732 he received the degree of Master of Arts from the University of Paris. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy in 1735 and, instead, decided to study at the Paris Law Faculty. His study of law was short-lived, however, and in the early 1740s he decided to become a writer and translator. Because of his refusal to enter one of the learned professions, he was disowned by his father and, for the next ten years, he lived a bohemian existence.

In 1742 he formed a friendship with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whom he met while watching games of chess and drinking coffee at the Café de la Régence. In October 1743, he further alienated his father by marrying Antoinette Champion (1710–1796), a devout Catholic. Diderot senior considered the match inappropriate, given Champion&#x27;s low social standing, poor education, fatherless status, and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. She bore Diderot one surviving child, a girl, named Angélique, after both Diderot&#x27;s dead mother and his sister. The death in 1749 of his sister Angélique, a nun, in her convent, may have affected Diderot&#x27;s opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun, &quot;La Religieuse&quot;, in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a convent, where she suffers at the hands of her fellow nuns.

Diderot was unfaithful to his wife, and had affairs with Anne-Gabrielle Babuty (who would marry and later divorce the artist Jean-Baptiste Greuze), Madeleine de Puisieux, Sophie Volland, and Mme de Maux (Jeanne-Catherine de Maux), to whom he wrote numerous surviving letters and who eventually left him for a younger man. Diderot&#x27;s letters to Sophie Volland are known for their candor and are regarded to be &quot;among the literary treasures of the eighteenth century&quot;.

== Early works ==
Diderot&#x27;s earliest works included a translation of Temple Stanyan&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot; (1743). In 1745, he published a translation of Shaftesbury&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit&quot;, to which he had added his own &quot;reflections&quot;. With two colleagues, François-Vincent Toussaint and Marc-Antoine Eidous, he produced a translation of Robert James&#x27;s &quot;Medicinal Dictionary&quot; (1746–1748).

===&quot;Philosophical Thoughts&quot;===

In 1746, Diderot wrote his first original work: the &quot;Philosophical Thoughts&quot; (&quot;Pensées philosophiques&quot;). In this book, Diderot argued for a reconciliation of reason with feeling so as to establish harmony. According to Diderot, without feeling there is a detrimental effect on virtue, and no possibility of creating sublime work. However, since feeling without discipline can be destructive, reason is necessary to control feeling.

At the time Diderot wrote this book he was a deist. Hence there is a defense of deism in this book, and some arguments against atheism. The book also contains criticism of Christianity.

===&quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Walk&quot;===

In 1747, Diderot wrote &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Walk&quot; (&quot;Promenade du sceptique&quot;) in which a deist, an atheist, and a pantheist have a dialogue on the nature of divinity. The deist gives the argument from design. The atheist says that the universe is better explained by physics, chemistry, matter, and motion. The pantheist says that the cosmic unity of mind and matter, which are co-eternal and comprise the universe, is God. This work remained unpublished until 1830. Accounts differ as to why. It was either because the local police, warned by the priests of another attack on Christianity, seized the manuscript, or because the authorities forced Diderot to give an undertaking that he would not publish this work.

===&quot;The Indiscreet Jewels&quot;===

In 1748, Diderot needed to raise money on short notice. His wife had born him a child, and his mistress Madeleine de Puisieux was making financial demands of him. At this time, Diderot had told his mistress that writing a novel was a trivial task, whereupon she challenged him to write one. As a result, Diderot produced &quot;The Indiscreet Jewels&quot; (&quot;Les bijoux indiscrets&quot;). The book is about the magical ring of a Sultan that induces any woman&#x27;s &quot;discreet jewels&quot; to confess their sexual experiences when the ring is pointed at them. In all, the ring is pointed at thirty different women in the book—usually at a dinner or a social meeting—with the Sultan typically being visible to the woman. However, since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required, a few of the sexual experiences recounted are through direct observation with the Sultan making himself invisible and placing his person in the unsuspecting woman&#x27;s boudoir.

Besides the bawdiness, there are several digressions into philosophy, music, and literature in the book. In one such philosophical digression, the Sultan has a dream in which he sees a child named &quot;Experiment&quot; growing bigger and stronger till the child demolishes an ancient temple named &quot;Hypothesis&quot;. The book proved to be lucrative for Diderot even though it could only be sold clandestinely. It is Diderot&#x27;s most published work.

The book is believed to draw upon the 1742 libertine novel &quot;Le Sopha&quot; by Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (Crébillon fils).

===Scientific work===
Diderot kept writing on science in a desultory way all his life. The scientific work of which he was most proud was &quot;Memoires sur differents sujets de mathematique&quot; (1748). This work contains original ideas on acoustics, tension, air resistance, and &quot;a project for a new organ&quot; that could be played by all. Some of Diderot&#x27;s scientific works were applauded by contemporary publications of his time such as &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Journal des savants&quot;; and the Jesuit publication &quot;Journal de Trevoux,&quot; which invited more such work: &quot;on the part of a man as clever and able as M. Diderot seems to be, of whom we should also observe that his style is as elegant, trenchant, and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious.&quot;

On the unity of nature Diderot wrote, &quot;Without the idea of the whole, philosophy is no more,&quot; and, &quot;Everything changes; everything passes; nothing remains but the whole.&quot; He wrote of the temporal nature of molecules, and rejected &quot;&quot;, the view that organisms are pre-formed in an infinite regression of non-changing germs. He saw minerals and species as part of a spectrum, and he was fascinated with hermaphroditism. His answer to the universal attraction in corpuscular physics models was universal elasticity. His view of nature&#x27;s flexibility foreshadows the discovery of evolution, but it is not Darwinistic in a strict sense.

===&quot;Letter on the Blind&quot;===
Diderot&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Letter on the Blind&quot; (&quot;Lettre sur les aveugles à l&#x27;usage de ceux qui voient&quot;) (1749) introduced him to the world as an original thinker. The subject is a discussion of the relation between reasoning and the knowledge acquired through perception (the five senses). The title of his book also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were &quot;the blind&quot; under discussion. In the essay, blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson argues that, since knowledge derives from the senses, mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree on. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch. (A later essay, &quot;Lettre sur les sourds et muets&quot;, considered the case of a similar deprivation in the deaf and mute.) According to Jonathan Israel, what makes the &quot;Lettre sur les aveugles&quot; so remarkable, however, is its distinct, if undeveloped, presentation of the theory of variation and natural selection.

This powerful essay, for which La Mettrie expressed warm appreciation in 1751, revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a deist clergyman who endeavours to win him around to a belief in a providential God during his last hours. Saunderson&#x27;s arguments are those of a neo-Spinozist Naturalist and fatalist, using a sophisticated notion of the self-generation and natural evolution of species without creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of &quot;thinking matter&quot; is upheld and the &quot;argument from design&quot; discarded (following La Mettrie) as hollow and unconvincing.

The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749, and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot, who had been under police surveillance since 1747, was swiftly identified as the author, had his manuscripts confiscated, and he was imprisoned for some months, under a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;, on the outskirts of Paris, in the dungeons at Vincennes where he was visited almost daily by Rousseau, at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.

Voltaire wrote an enthusiastic letter to Diderot commending the &quot;Lettre&quot; and stating that he had held Diderot in high regard for a long time, to which Diderot sent a warm response. Soon after this, Diderot was arrested.

Science historian Conway Zirkle has written that Diderot was an early evolutionary thinker and noted that his passage that described natural selection was &quot;so clear and accurate that it almost seems that we would be forced to accept his conclusions as a logical necessity even in the absence of the evidence collected since his time.&quot;

==Incarceration and release==
Angered by public resentment over the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the government started incarcerating many of its critics. It was decided at this time to rein in Diderot. On 23 July 1749, the governor of the Vincennes fortress instructed the police to incarcerate Diderot, and the next day he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement at Vincennes. It was at this period that Rousseau visited Diderot in prison and came out a changed man, with newfound ideas about the disadvantages of knowledge, civilization, and Enlightenment – the so-called &quot;illumination de Vincennes&quot;.

Diderot had been permitted to retain one book that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which he read during his incarceration. He wrote notes and annotations on the book, using a toothpick as a pen, and ink that he made by scraping slate from the walls and mixing it with wine.

In August 1749, Mme du Chatelet, presumably at Voltaire&#x27;s behest, wrote to the governor of Vincennes, who was her relative, pleading for Diderot to be lodged more comfortably during his incarceration. The governor then offered Diderot access to the great halls of the Vincennes castle and the freedom to receive books and visitors providing he wrote a document of submission. On 13 August 1749, Diderot wrote to the governor:

On 20 August, Diderot was moved to a comfortable room in the fortess and allowed to meet visitors and walk within the gardens. On 23 August, Diderot signed another letter promising never to leave the prison without permission. On 3 November 1749, he was given his freedom. Subsequently, in 1750, he released the prospectus for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

== Encyclopédie ==
===Genesis===
André le Breton, a bookseller and printer, approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of Ephraim Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; into French, first undertaken by the Englishman John Mills, and followed by the German Gottfried Sellius. Diderot accepted the proposal, and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work, which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the Republic of Letters. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert was persuaded to become Diderot&#x27;s colleague, and permission was procured from the government.

In 1750, an elaborate prospectus announced the project, and the first volume was published in 1751. This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that &quot;An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto, and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies, but each and every branch of human knowledge.&quot; Comprehensive knowledge will give &quot;the power to change men&#x27;s common way of thinking.&quot; The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.

===Controversies===
Diderot&#x27;s work, however, was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed, accusations arose regarding seditious content, concerning the editor&#x27;s entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles: but the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They had been hidden in the house of an unlikely confederate—Chretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes, who originally ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist, and loyal to the monarchy—he was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support, and that of other well-placed influential confederates, the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.

These twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery, but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757, they could endure it no longer—the subscribers had grown from 2,000 to 4,000, a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power. Diderot wanted the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; to give all the knowledge of the world to the people of France. However, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; threatened the governing social classes of France (aristocracy) because it took for granted the justice of religious tolerance, freedom of thought, and the value of science and industry. It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nation&#x27;s government ought to be the nation&#x27;s common people. It was believed that the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society, and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was formally suppressed. The decree did not stop the work, which went on, but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues, including Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune, declined to contribute further to a book that had acquired a bad reputation.

===Diderot&#x27;s contribution===
Diderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote approximately 7,000 articles, some very slight, but many of them laborious, comprehensive, and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less scrupulous contributors. He spent his days at workshops, mastering manufacturing processes, and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765.

In 1764, when his immense work was drawing to an end, he encountered a crowning mortification: he discovered that the bookseller, Le Breton, fearing the government&#x27;s displeasure, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had left Diderot&#x27;s hands, all passages that he considered too dangerous. &quot;He and his printing-house overseer&quot;, writes Furbank, &quot;had worked in complete secrecy, and had moreover deliberately destroyed the author&#x27;s original manuscript so that the damage could not be repaired.&quot; The monument to which Diderot had given the labor of twenty long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced. It was 12 years, in 1772, before the subscribers received the final 28 folio volumes of the &quot;Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot; since the first volume had been published.

When Diderot&#x27;s work on the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; project came to an end in 1765, he expressed concerns to his friends that the twenty-five years he had spent on the project had been wasted.

== Mature works ==
Although the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; was Diderot&#x27;s most monumental product, he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every intellectual field with new and creative ideas. Diderot&#x27;s writing ranges from a graceful trifle like the &quot;Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre&quot; (&quot;Regrets for my Old Dressing Gown&quot;) up to the heady &quot;D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Dream&quot; (&quot;Le Rêve de d&#x27;Alembert&quot;) (composed 1769), a philosophical dialogue in which he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of matter and the meaning of life. &quot;Jacques le fataliste&quot; (written between 1765 and 1780, but not published until 1792 in German and 1796 in French) is similar to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; and &quot;The Sentimental Journey&quot; in its challenge to the conventional novel&#x27;s structure and content.

===&quot;La Religieuse&quot; (&quot;The Nun&quot; or &quot;Memoirs of a Nun&quot;)===
&quot;La Religieuse&quot; was a novel that claimed to show the corruption of the Catholic Church&#x27;s institutions.

====Plot====
The novel began not as a work for literary consumption, but as an elaborate practical joke aimed at luring the Marquis de Croismare, a companion of Diderot&#x27;s, back to Paris. &quot;The Nun&quot; is set in the 18th century, that is, contemporary France. Suzanne Simonin is an intelligent and sensitive sixteen-year-old French girl who is forced against her will into a Catholic convent by her parents. Suzanne&#x27;s parents initially inform her that she is being sent to the convent for financial reasons. However, while in the convent, she learns that she is actually there because she is an illegitimate child, as her mother committed adultery. By sending Suzanne to the convent, her mother thought she could make amends for her sins by using her daughter as a sacrificial offering.

At the convent, Suzanne suffers humiliation, harassment and violence because she refuses to make the vows of the religious community. She eventually finds companionship with the Mother Superior, Sister de Moni, who pities Suzanne&#x27;s anguish. After Sister de Moni&#x27;s death, the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, does not share the same empathy for Suzanne that her predecessor had, blaming Suzanne for the death of Sister de Moni. Suzanne is physically and mentally harassed by Sister Sainte-Christine, almost to the point of death.

Suzanne contacts her lawyer, Monsieur Manouri, who attempts to legally free her from her vows. Manouri manages to have Suzanne transferred to another convent, Sainte-Eutrope. At the new convent, the Mother Superior is revealed to be a lesbian, and she grows affectionate towards Suzanne. The Mother Superior attempts to seduce Suzanne, but her innocence and chastity eventually drives the Mother Superior to insanity, leading to her death.

Suzanne escapes the Sainte-Eutrope convent using the help of a priest. Following her liberation, she lives in fear of being captured and taken back to the convent as she awaits the help from Diderot&#x27;s friend the Marquis de Croismare.

====Analysis====
Diderot&#x27;s novel was not aimed at condemning Christianity as such but at criticizing cloistered religious life. In Diderot&#x27;s telling, some critics have claimed, the Church is depicted as fostering a hierarchical society, exemplified in the power dynamic between the Mother Superior and the girls in the convent, forced as they are against their will to take the vows and endure what is to them the intolerable life of the convent. On this view, the subjection of the unwilling young women to convent life dehumanized them by repressing their sexuality. Moreover, their plight would have been all the more oppressive since it should be remembered that in France at this period, religious vows were recognized, regulated and enforced not only by the Church but also by the civil authorities. Some broaden their interpretation to suggest that Diderot was out to expose more general victimization of women by the Catholic Church, that forced them to accept the fate imposed upon them by a hierarchical society.

====Posthumous publication====
Although &quot;The Nun&quot; was completed in about 1780, the work was not published until 1796, after Diderot&#x27;s death.

===&quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot;===
The dialogue &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (French: &quot;Le Neveu de Rameau&quot;) is a &quot;farce-tragedy&quot; reminiscent of the &quot;Satires&quot; of Horace, a favorite classical author of Diderot&#x27;s whose lines &quot;Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis&quot; (&quot;Born under (the influence of) the unfavorable (gods) Vertumnuses, however many they are&quot;) appear as epigraph. According to Nicholas Cronk, &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot; is &quot;arguably the greatest work of the French Enlightenment&#x27;s greatest writer.&quot;

====Synopsis====
The narrator in the book recounts a conversation with Jean-François Rameau, nephew of the famous composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but feels disadvantaged by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wife&#x27;s death, he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot: a man who was once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife, who is now living in poverty and decadence, shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothing—not in religion, nor in morality; nor in the Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another. He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system. The wise man, according to the nephew, will consequently practice hedonism:

The dialogue ends with Diderot calling the nephew a wastrel, a coward, and a glutton devoid of spiritual values to which the nephew replies: &quot;I believe you are right.&quot;

====Analysis====
Diderot&#x27;s intention in writing the dialogue—whether as a satire on contemporary manners, a reduction of the theory of self-interest to an absurdity, the application of irony to the ethics of ordinary convention, a mere setting for a discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original—is disputed. In political terms it explores &quot;the bipolarisation of the social classes under absolute monarchy,&quot; and insofar as its protagonist demonstrates how the servant often manipulates the master, &quot;Le Neveu de Rameau&quot; can be seen to anticipate Hegel&#x27;s master–slave dialectic.

====Posthumous publication====
The publication history of the &quot;Nephew&quot; is circuitous. Written between 1761 and 1774, Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime, and apparently did not even share it with his friends. After Diderot&#x27;s death, a copy of the text reached Schiller, who gave it to Goethe, who, in 1805, translated the work into German. Goethe&#x27;s translation entered France, and was retranslated into French in 1821. Another copy of the text was published in 1823, but it had been expurgated by Diderot&#x27;s daughter prior to publication. The original manuscript was only found in 1891.

==Visual arts==
Diderot&#x27;s most intimate friend was the philologist Friedrich Melchior Grimm. They were brought together by their common friend at that time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1753, Grimm began writing a newsletter, the &quot;La Correspondance littéraire, philosophique et critique&quot;, which he would send to various high personages in Europe.

In 1759, Grimm asked Diderot to report on the biennial art exhibitions in the Louvre for the &quot;Correspondance&quot;. Diderot reported on the Salons between 1759 and 1771 and again in 1775 and 1781. Diderot&#x27;s reports would become &quot;the most celebrated contributions to La Correspondance.&quot;

According to Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Diderot&#x27;s reports initiated the French into a new way of laughing, and introduced people to the mystery and purport of colour by ideas. &quot;Before Diderot&quot;, Anne Louise Germaine de Staël wrote, &quot;I had never seen anything in pictures except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave them relief and life, and it is almost a new sense for which I am indebted to his genius&quot;.

Diderot had appended an &quot;Essai sur la peinture&quot; to his report on the 1765 Salon in which he expressed his views on artistic beauty. Goethe described the &quot;Essai sur la peinture&quot; as &quot;a magnificent work; it speaks even more usefully to the poet than to the painter, though for the painter too it is a torch of blazing illumination&quot;.

Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725–1805) was Diderot&#x27;s favorite contemporary artist. Diderot appreciated Greuze&#x27;s sentimentality, and more particularly Greuze&#x27;s portrayals of his wife who had once been Diderot&#x27;s mistress.

==Theatre==
Diderot wrote sentimental plays, &quot;Le Fils naturel&quot; (1757) and &quot;Le Père de famille&quot; (1758), accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice, including &quot;Les Entretiens sur &quot;Le Fils Naturel&quot;&quot; (Conversations on &quot;The Natural Son&quot;), in which he announced the principles of a new drama: the &#x27;serious genre&#x27;, a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage. In 1758, Diderot introduced the concept of the fourth wall, the imaginary &quot;wall&quot; at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled box set in a proscenium theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play. He also wrote &quot;Paradoxe sur le comédien&quot; (&quot;Paradox of the Actor&quot;), written between 1770 and 1778 but first published after his death in 1830, which is a dramatic essay elucidating a theory of acting in which it is argued that great actors do not experience the emotions they are displaying. That essay is also of note for being where the term &quot;l&#x27;esprit de l&#x27;escalier&quot; (or &quot;l&#x27;esprit d&#x27;escalier&quot;) comes from. It is a French term used in English for the predicament of thinking of the perfect reply too late.

==Diderot and Catherine the Great==
===Journey to Russia===
When the Russian Empress Catherine the Great heard that Diderot was in need of money, she arranged to buy his library and appoint him caretaker of it until his death, at a salary of 1,000 livres per year. She even paid him 50 years salary in advance. Although Diderot hated traveling, he was obliged to visit her.

On 9 October 1773, he reached Saint Petersburg, met Catherine the next day and they had several discussions on various subjects. During his five-month stay at her court, he met her almost every day. During these conversations, he would later state, they spoke &#x27;man to man&#x27;.

He would occasionally make his point by slapping her thighs. In a letter to Madame Geoffrin, Catherine wrote:
One of the topics discussed was Diderot&#x27;s ideas about how to transform Russia into a utopia. In a letter to Comte de Ségur, the Empress wrote that if she followed Diderot&#x27;s advice, chaos would ensue in her kingdom.

===Back in France===
When returning, Diderot asked the Empress for 1,500 rubles as reimbursement for his trip. She gave him 3,000 rubles, an expensive ring, and an officer to escort him back to Paris. He wrote a eulogy in her honor upon reaching Paris.

In 1766, when Catherine heard that Diderot had not received his annual fee for editing the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; (an important source of income for the philosopher), she arranged for him to receive a massive sum of 50,000 livres as an advance for his services as her librarian.

In July 1784, upon hearing that Diderot was in poor health, Catherine arranged for him to move into a luxurious suite in the &quot;Rue de Richelieu&quot;. Diderot died two weeks after moving there—on 31 July 1784.

Among Diderot&#x27;s last works were notes &quot;On the Instructions of her Imperial Majesty...for the Drawing up of Laws&quot;. This commentary on Russia included replies to some arguments Catherine had made in the Nakaz. Diderot wrote that Catherine was certainly despotic, due to circumstances and training, but was not inherently tyrannical. Thus, if she wished to destroy despotism in Russia, she should abdicate her throne and destroy anyone who tries to revive the monarchy. She should publicly declare that &quot;there is no true sovereign other than the nation, and there can be no true legislator other than the people.&quot; She should create a new Russian legal code establishing an independent legal framework and starting with the text: &quot;We the people, and we the sovereign of this people, swear conjointly these laws, by which we are judged equally.&quot; In the &quot;Nakaz&quot;, Catherine had written: &quot;It is for legislation to follow the spirit of the nation.&quot; Diderot&#x27;s rebuttal stated that it is for legislation to &quot;make&quot; the spirit of the nation. For instance, he argued, it is not appropriate to make public executions unnecessarily horrific.

Ultimately, Diderot decided not to send these notes to Catherine; however, they were delivered to her with his other papers after he died. When she read them, she was furious and commented that they were an incoherent gibberish devoid of prudence, insight, and verisimilitude.

== Philosophy ==

In his youth, Diderot was originally a follower of Voltaire and his deist &quot;Anglomanie&quot;, but gradually moved away from this line of thought towards materialism and atheism, a move which was finally realised in 1747 in the philosophical debate in the second part of his &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1747). Diderot opposed mysticism and occultism, which were highly prevalent in France at the time he wrote, and believed religious truth claims must fall under the domain of reason, not mystical experience or esoteric secrets. However, Diderot showed some interest in the work of Paracelsus. He was &quot;a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another&quot; (Rosenkranz).

In his 1754 book &quot;On the interpretation of Nature&quot;, Diderot expounded on his views about nature, evolution, materialism, mathematics, and experimental science. It is speculated that Diderot may have contributed to his friend Baron d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s 1770 book &quot;The System of Nature&quot;. Diderot had enthusiastically endorsed the book stating that: 

In conceiving the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, Diderot had thought of the work as a fight on behalf of posterity and had expressed confidence that posterity would be grateful for his effort. According to Diderot, &quot;posterity is for the philosopher what the &#x27;other world&#x27; is for the man of religion.&quot;

According to Andrew S. Curran, the main questions of Diderot&#x27;s thought are the following :
* Why be moral in a world without god?
* How should we appreciate art?
* What are we and where do we come from?
* What are sex and love?
* How can a philosopher intervene in political affairs?

== Death and burial ==
Diderot died of pulmonary thrombosis in Paris on 31 July 1784, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Église Saint-Roch. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II, who had it deposited at the National Library of Russia. He has several times been denied burial in the Panthéon with other French notables.

Diderot&#x27;s remains were unearthed by grave robbers in 1793, leaving his corpse on the church&#x27;s floor. His remains were then presumably transferred to a mass grave by the authorities.

==Appreciation and influence==
Marmontel and Henri Meister commented on the great pleasure of having intellectual conversations with Diderot. Morellet, a regular attendee at D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s salon, wrote: &quot;It is there that I heard...Diderot treat questions of philosophy, art, or literature, and by his wealth of expression, fluency, and inspired appearance, hold our attention for a long stretch of time.&quot; Diderot&#x27;s contemporary, and rival, Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot; that after a few centuries Diderot would be accorded as much respect by posterity as was given to Plato and Aristotle. In Germany, Goethe, Schiller, and Lessing expressed admiration for Diderot&#x27;s writings, Goethe pronouncing Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot; to be &quot;the classical work of an outstanding man&quot; and that &quot;Diderot is Diderot, a unique individual; whoever carps at him and his affairs is a philistine.&quot;

As atheism fell out of favor during the French Revolution, Diderot was vilified and considered responsible for the excessive persecution of the clergy.

In the next century, Diderot was admired by Balzac, Delacroix, Stendhal, Zola, and Schopenhauer. According to Comte, Diderot was the foremost intellectual in an exciting age. Historian Michelet described him as &quot;the true Prometheus&quot; and stated that Diderot&#x27;s ideas would continue to remain influential long into the future. Marx chose Diderot as his &quot;favourite prose-writer.&quot;

==Modern tributes==
Otis Fellows and Norman Torrey have described Diderot as &quot;the most interesting and provocative figure of the French eighteenth century.&quot;

In 1993, American writer Cathleen Schine published &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Niece&quot;, a satire of academic life in New York that took as its premise a woman&#x27;s research into an (imagined) 18th-century pornographic parody of Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. The book was praised by Michiko Kakutani in the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;a nimble philosophical satire of the academic mind&quot; and &quot;an enchanting comedy of modern manners.&quot;

French author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt wrote a play titled &quot;Le Libertin&quot; (&quot;The Libertine&quot;) which imagines a day in Diderot&#x27;s life including a fictional sitting for a woman painter which becomes sexually charged but is interrupted by the demands of editing the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. It was first staged at Paris&#x27; Théâtre Montparnasse in 1997 starring Bernard Giraudeau as Diderot and Christiane Cohendy as Madame Therbouche and was well received by critics.

In 2013, the 300th anniversary of Diderot&#x27;s birth, his hometown of Langres held a series of events in his honor and produced an audio tour of the town highlighting places that were part of Diderot&#x27;s past, including the remains of the convent where his sister Angélique took her vows. On 6 October 2013, a museum of the Enlightenment focusing on Diderot&#x27;s contributions to the movement, the Maison des Lumières Denis Diderot, was inaugurated in Langres.

The French government considered memorializing the 300th anniversary of his birth, but this did not come to pass.

<text>The discoveries of the 118 chemical elements known to exist as of 2025 are presented here in chronological order. The elements are listed generally in the order in which each was first defined as the pure element, as the exact date of discovery of most elements cannot be accurately determined. There are plans to synthesize more elements, and it is not known how many elements are possible.

Each element&#x27;s name, atomic number, year of first report, name of the discoverer, and notes related to the discovery are listed.

==Modern discoveries==
For 18th-century discoveries, around the time that Antoine Lavoisier first questioned the phlogiston theory, the recognition of a new &quot;earth&quot; has been regarded as being equivalent to the discovery of a new element (as was the general practice then). For some elements (e.g. Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zr, Mo), this presents further difficulties as their compounds were widely known since medieval or even ancient times, even though the elements themselves were not. Since the true nature of those compounds was sometimes only gradually discovered, it is sometimes very difficult to name one specific discoverer. In such cases the first publication on their chemistry is noted, and a longer explanation given in the notes.

<doc id="8202" wikidata="Q23702413" url="?curid=8202" title="Diatonic scale">
<text>In music theory a diatonic scale is a heptatonic (seven-note) scale that includes five whole steps (whole tones) and two half steps (semitones) in each octave, in which the two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps. In other words, the half steps are maximally separated from each other.

The seven pitches of any diatonic scale can also be obtained by using a chain of six perfect fifths. For instance, the seven natural pitch classes that form the C-major scale can be obtained from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F:
:F–C–G–D–A–E–B.

Any sequence of seven successive natural notes, such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, and any transposition thereof, is a diatonic scale. Modern musical keyboards are designed so that the white-key notes form a diatonic scale, though transpositions of this diatonic scale require one or more black keys. A diatonic scale can be also described as two tetrachords separated by a whole tone. In musical set theory, Allen Forte classifies diatonic scales as set form 7–35.

The term &quot;diatonic&quot; originally referred to the diatonic genus, one of the three genera of the ancient Greeks, and comes from , of uncertain etymology. Most likely, it refers to the intervals being &quot;stretched out&quot; in that tuning, in contrast to the other two genera (chromatic and enharmonic).

This article does not concern alternative seven-note scales such as the harmonic minor or the melodic minor which, although sometimes called &quot;diatonic&quot;, do not fulfill the condition of maximal separation of the semitones indicated above.

==History==
Western music from the Middle Ages until the late 19th century (see common practice period) is based on the diatonic scale and the unique hierarchical relationships created by this system of organizing seven notes.

===Antiquity===
Evidence that the Sumerians and Babylonians used a version of the diatonic scale is found in cuneiform inscriptions that contain both musical compositions and a tuning system. Despite the conjectural nature of reconstructions of the Hurrian songs, the diatonic nature of the tuning system is demonstrated by the fact that it involves a series of six perfect fifths, which is a recipe for the construction of a diatonic scale.

The 9,000-year-old flutes found in Jiahu, China, indicate the evolution over 1,200 years of flutes having 4, 5 and 6 holes to having 7 and 8 holes, the latter exhibiting striking similarity to diatonic hole spacings and sounds.

===Middle Ages===
The scales corresponding to the medieval church modes were diatonic. Depending on which of the seven notes of the diatonic scale you use as the beginning, the positions of the intervals fall at different distances from the starting tone (the &quot;reference note&quot;), producing seven different scales. One of these, the one starting on B, has no pure fifth above its reference note (B–F is a diminished fifth): it is probably for this reason that it was not used. Of the six remaining scales, two were described as corresponding to two others with a B instead of a B:

# A–B–C–D–E–F–G–A was described as D–E–F–G–A–B–C–D (the modern Aeolian modes whose reference notes are A and D, respectively, corresponding to the Aeolian modes of C major and F major, respectively)
# C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C was described as F–G–A–B–C–D–E–F (the modern Ionian modes whose reference notes are C and F, respectively, corresponding to the Ionian modes of C major and F major, respectively).

As a result, medieval theory described the church modes as corresponding to four diatonic scales only (two of which had the variable B/). They were the modern Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, and Mixolydian modes of C major, plus the Aeolian and Ionian modes of F major when B was substituted into the Dorian and Lydian modes of C major, respectively.

===Renaissance===
Heinrich Glarean considered that the modal scales including a B had to be the result of a transposition. In his &quot;Dodecachordon&quot;, he not only described six &quot;natural&quot; diatonic scales (still neglecting the seventh one with a diminished fifth above the reference note), but also six &quot;transposed&quot; ones, each including a B, resulting in the total of twelve scales that justified the title of his treatise. These were the 6 non-Locrian modes of C major and F major.

===Modern===
By the beginning of the Baroque period, the notion of the musical key was established, describing additional possible transpositions of the diatonic scale. Major and minor scales came to dominate until at least the start of the 20th century, partly because their intervallic patterns are suited to the reinforcement of a central triad. Some church modes survived into the early 18th century, as well as appearing in classical and 20th-century music, and jazz (see chord-scale system).

==Theory==

Of Glarean&#x27;s six natural scales, three have a major third/first triad: (Ionian, Lydian, and Mixolydian), and three have a minor one: Dorian, Phrygian, and Aeolian). To these may be added the seventh diatonic scale, with a diminished fifth above the reference note, the Locrian scale. These could be transposed not only to include one flat in the signature (as described by Glarean), but to all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, resulting in a total of eighty-four diatonic scales.

The modern musical keyboard originated as a diatonic keyboard with only white keys. The black keys were progressively added for several purposes:

* improving the consonances, mainly the thirds, by providing a major third on each degree;
* allowing all twelve transpositions described above;
* and helping musicians to find their bearings on the keyboard.

The pattern of elementary intervals forming the diatonic scale can be represented either by the letters T (tone) and S (semitone) respectively. With this abbreviation, a major scale, for instance, can be represented as

:T–T–S–T–T–T–S

===Major scale===

The major scale or Ionian mode is one of the diatonic scales. It is made up of seven distinct notes, plus an eighth that duplicates the first an octave higher. The pattern of seven intervals separating the eight notes is T–T–S–T–T–T–S. In solfège, the syllables used to name each degree of the scale are &quot;Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Ti–Do&quot;. A sequence of successive natural notes starting from C is an example of major scale, called C-major scale.
The eight degrees of the scale are also known by traditional names, especially when used in a tonal context:
:*1st – Tonic (key note)
:*2nd – Supertonic
:*3rd – Mediant
:*4th – Subdominant
:*5th – Dominant
:*6th – Submediant
:*7th – Leading tone
:*8th – Tonic (Octave)

===Natural minor scale===

For each major scale, there is a corresponding natural minor scale, sometimes called its relative minor. It uses the same sequence of notes as the corresponding major scale but starts from a different note. That is, it begins on the sixth degree of the major scale and proceeds step-by-step to the first octave of the sixth degree. A sequence of successive natural notes starting from A is an example of a natural minor scale, called the A natural minor scale.
The degrees of the natural minor scale, especially in a tonal context, have the same names as those of the major scale, except the seventh degree, which is known as the subtonic because it is a whole step below the tonic. The term leading tone is generally reserved for seventh degrees that are a &quot;half step&quot; (semitone) below the tonic, as is the case in the major scale.

Besides the natural minor scale, five other kinds of scales can be obtained from the notes of a major scale, by simply choosing a different note as the starting note. All these scales meet the definition of diatonic scale.

===Modes===

The whole collection of diatonic scales as defined above can be divided into seven different scales.

As explained above, all major scales use the same interval sequence T–T–S–T–T–T–S. This interval sequence was called the &quot;Ionian mode&quot; by Glarean. It is one of the seven modern modes. From any major scale, a new scale is obtained by taking a different degree as the tonic. With this method it is possible to generate six other scales or modes from each major scale. Another way to describe the same result would be to consider that, behind the diatonic scales, there exists an underlying diatonic system which is the series of diatonic notes without a reference note; assigning the reference note in turn to each of the seven notes in each octave of the system produces seven diatonic scales, each characterized by a different interval sequence:

The first column examples shown above are formed by natural notes (i.e. neither sharps nor flats, also called &quot;white-notes&quot;, as they can be played using the white keys of a piano keyboard). However, any transposition of each of these scales (or of the system underlying them) is a valid example of the corresponding mode. In other words, transposition preserves mode. This is shown in the second column, with each mode transposed to start on C. 

The whole set of diatonic scales is commonly defined as the set composed of these seven natural-note scales, together with all of their possible transpositions. As discussed elsewhere, different definitions of this set are sometimes adopted in the literature.

===Diatonic scales and tetrachords===
A diatonic scale can be also described as two tetrachords separated by a whole tone. For example, under this view the two tetrachord structures of C major would be:
:[C–D–E–F] – [G–A–B–C]
each tetrachord being formed of two tones and a semitone, T–T–S,

and the natural minor of A would be:
:[A–B–C–D] – [E–F–G–A]
formed two different tetrachords, the first consisting in a semitone between two tones, T–S–T, and the second of a semitone and two tones, S–T–T.

The medieval conception of the tetrachordal structure, however, was based on one single tetrachord, that of the D scale,
:[D–E–F–G] – [A–B–C–D]
each formed of a semitone between tones, T–S–T. It viewed other diatonic scales as differently overlapping disjunct and conjunct tetrachords:
:E scale: E–F–G | A–B–C–D = D–E
:F scale: F–G | A–B–C–D = D–E–F
:G scale: G | A–B–C–D = D–E–F–G
:A scale: A–B–C–D = D–E–F–G | A
:B scale: B–C–D = D–E–F–G | A–B
:C scale: C–D = D–E–F–G | A–B–C
(where G | A indicates the disjunction of tetrachords, always between G and A, and D = D indicates their conjunction, always on the common note D).

==Tuning==
Diatonic scales can be tuned variously, either by iteration of a perfect or tempered fifth, or by a combination of perfect fifths and perfect thirds (Just intonation), or possibly by a combination of fifths and thirds of various sizes, as in well temperament.

===Iteration of the fifth===

If the scale is produced by the iteration of six perfect fifths, for instance F–C–G–D–A–E–B, the result is Pythagorean tuning:

This tuning dates to Ancient Mesopotamia (see ), and was done by alternating ascending fifths with descending fourths (equal to an ascending fifth followed by a descending octave), resulting in the notes of a pentatonic or heptatonic scale falling within an octave.

Six of the &quot;fifth&quot; intervals (C–G, D–A, E–B, F–C&#x27;, G–D&#x27;, A–E&#x27;) are all = 1.5 (701.955 cents), but B–F&#x27; is the discordant tritone, here = 1.423828125 (611.73 cents). Tones are each = 1.125 (203.91 cents) and diatonic semitones are ≈ 1.0535 (90.225 cents).

Extending the series of fifths to eleven fifths would result into the Pythagorean chromatic scale.

===Equal temperament===

Equal temperament is the division of the octave in twelve equal semitones. The frequency ratio of the semitone then becomes the twelfth root of two ( ≈ 1.059463, 100 cents). The tone is the sum of two semitone. Its ratio is the sixth root of two ( ≈ 1.122462, 200 cents). Equal temperament can be produced by a succession of tempered fifths, each of them with the ratio of 2 ≈ 1.498307, 700 cents.

===Meantone temperament===

The fifths could be tempered more than in equal temperament, in order to produce better thirds. See quarter-comma meantone for a meantone temperament commonly used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and sometimes after, which produces perfect major thirds.

===Just intonation===

Just intonation often is represented using Leonhard Euler&#x27;s Tonnetz, with the horizontal axis showing the perfect fifths and the vertical axis the perfect major thirds. In the Tonnetz, the diatonic scale in just intonation appears as follows:

F–A, C–E and G–B, aligned vertically, are perfect major thirds; A–E–B and F–C–G–D are two series of perfect fifths. The notes of the top line, A, E and B, are lowered by the syntonic comma, , and the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth D–A is too narrow by the same amount. The tritone F–B is ≈ 1.40625.

This tuning has been first described by Ptolemy and is known as Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic scale. It was also mentioned by Zarlino in the 16th century and has been described by theorists in the 17th and 18th centuries as the &quot;natural&quot; scale.
Since the frequency ratios are based on simple powers of the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, this is also known as five-limit tuning.

<text>The &quot;&#x27;&quot;, officially titled &quot;&#x27;&quot;, is the national anthem of Germany. It was first adopted in 1922 during the period of the Weimar Republic, replacing &quot;Heil dir im Siegerkranz&quot;. The first stanza of &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; was used alongside the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; during the Nazi regime from 1933 until the end of World War II. Since then, only the third stanza has been used officially as the national anthem.

Its phrase &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Unity and Justice and Freedom&#x27;) is considered the unofficial national motto of Germany, and is inscribed on modern German Army belt buckles and the rims of some German coins.

The music is derived from that of &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot;, composed in 1797 by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn as an anthem for the birthday of Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and later of Austria. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of &quot; as a new text for that music, counterposing the national unification of Germany to the eulogy of a monarch: lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time.

The &quot; was adopted as the national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the Weimar Republic, to which all three stanzas were used. West Germany retained it as its official national anthem in 1952, with only the third stanza sung on official occasions. After German reunification in 1990, in 1991 only the third stanza was reconfirmed as the national anthem. It is discouraged, although not illegal, to perform the first stanza (or to some degree, the second), due to association with the Nazi regime.

==Title==
The &quot; is also well known by the incipit and refrain of the first stanza, &quot; (&#x27;Germany, Germany above all&#x27;), but this has never been its title. This line originally meant that the most important aim of 19th-century German liberal revolutionaries should be a unified Germany which would overcome loyalties to the local kingdoms, principalities, duchies and palatines (&quot;Kleinstaaterei&quot;) of then-fragmented Germany, essentially that the &quot;idea&quot; of a unified Germany should be above all else. Later, and especially in Nazi Germany, these words came to more strongly express not only German superiority over and domination of other countries in particular, but that the &quot;idea&quot; of Germany is to root of all possible idealism among Germans.

== Melody ==

The melody of the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; was written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; (&quot;God save Francis the Emperor&quot;) by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. In its original form, the song was an anthem honouring Francis II, emperor of the Austrian Empire. It was intended as an impetus to Austrian patriotism, modeled on Great Britain&#x27;s &quot;God Save the King&quot;. 

The melody later became the music of the national anthem of Austria-Hungary, prior to the abolition of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918. 

The re-use of Haydn&#x27;s melody in the &quot;Deutschlandslied&quot; is one of a great number of later such adaptations and reuses.

In the score below, Haydn&#x27;s tune is shown along with the lyrics of the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;.

== Historical background ==

The Holy Roman Empire, stemming from the Middle Ages, was already disintegrating when the French Revolution and the ensuing Napoleonic Wars altered the political map of Central Europe. However, hopes for human rights and republican government after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815 were dashed when the Congress of Vienna reinstated many small German principalities. In addition, with the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and his secret police enforced censorship, mainly in universities, to keep a watch on the activities of teachers and students, whom he held responsible for the spread of radical liberalist ideas. Since reactionaries among the monarchs were the main adversaries, demands for freedom of the press and other liberal rights were most often uttered in connection with the demand for a united Germany, even though many revolutionaries-to-be held differing opinions over whether a republic or a constitutional monarchy would be the best solution for Germany.

The German Confederation (&quot;Deutscher Bund&quot;, 1815–1866) was a federation of 35 monarchical states and four republican free cities, with a Federal Assembly in Frankfurt. The federation was essentially a military alliance, but it was also abused by the larger powers to oppress liberal and national movements. Another federation, the German Customs Union (&quot;Zollverein&quot;) was formed among the majority of the states in 1834. In 1840, Hoffmann wrote a song about the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, also to Haydn&#x27;s melody, in which he ironically praised the free trade of German goods which brought Germans and Germany closer.

After the 1848 March Revolution, the German Confederation handed over its authority to the Frankfurt Parliament. For a short period in the late 1840s, Germany was united with the borders described in the anthem, and a democratic constitution was being drafted, and with the black-red-gold flag representing it. However, after 1849, the two largest German monarchies, Prussia and Austria, put an end to this liberal movement towards national unification.

== Lyrics ==
August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the text in 1841 while on holiday on the North Sea island Heligoland, then a possession of the United Kingdom (now part of Germany).

Hoffmann von Fallersleben intended &quot; to be sung to Haydn&#x27;s tune; the first publication of the poem included the music. The first line, &quot; (&#x27;Germany, Germany above all, above all in the world&#x27;), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a united Germany a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for &quot;&quot; (unity and justice and freedom), Hoffmann expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not arbitrary monarchy, would prevail.

In the era after the Congress of Vienna, influenced by Metternich and his secret police, Hoffmann&#x27;s text had a distinctly revolutionary and at the same time liberal connotation, since the appeal for a united Germany was most often made in connection with demands for freedom of the press and other civil rights. Its implication that loyalty to a larger Germany should replace loyalty to one&#x27;s local sovereign was then a revolutionary idea.

The year after he wrote &quot;Das Deutschlandlied&quot;, Hoffmann lost his job as a librarian and professor in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) because of this and other revolutionary works, and was forced into hiding until he was pardoned following the revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

Only the third stanza, in bold, is used as the modern German national anthem.

== Use before 1922 ==
The melody of the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; was originally written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; (&#x27;God save Franz the Emperor&#x27;) by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem to Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Habsburg, and was intended to rival in merit the British &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, &quot;&quot; became the official anthem of the emperor of the Austrian Empire. After the death of Francis II new lyrics were composed in 1854, &quot;Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze&quot;, that mentioned the Emperor, but not by name. With those new lyrics, the song continued to be the anthem of Imperial Austria and later of Austria-Hungary. Austrian monarchists continued to use this anthem after 1918 in the hope of restoring the monarchy. The adoption of the Austrian anthem&#x27;s melody by Germany in 1922 was not opposed by Austria.

&quot;&quot; was not played at an official ceremony until Germany and the United Kingdom had agreed on the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty in 1890, when it appeared only appropriate to sing it at the ceremony on the now officially German island of Heligoland. During the time of the German Empire, it became one of the most widely known patriotic songs.

The song became very popular after the 1914 Battle of Langemarck during World War I, when, supposedly, several German regiments, consisting mostly of students no older than 20, attacked the British lines on the Western front while singing the song, suffering heavy casualties. They are buried in the Langemark German war cemetery in Belgium.

By December 1914, according to George Haven Putnam, the song had &quot;come to express the […] war spirit of the Fatherland&quot; and &quot;the supremacy of Germans over all other peoples&quot;, despite being, in past years, &quot;an expression simply of patriotic devotion&quot;. Morris Jastrow Jr., then an American apologist for Germany, maintained that it meant only &quot;that Germany is dearer to Germans than anything else&quot;. J. William White wrote into the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; to confirm Putnam&#x27;s view.

== Official adoption ==
The melody used by the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; was still in use as the anthem of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its demise in 1918. On 11 August 1922, German President Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat, made the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; the official German national anthem. In 1919 the black, red and gold tricolour, the colours of the 19th century liberal revolutionaries advocated by the political left and centre, was adopted (rather than the previous black, white and red of Imperial Germany). Thus, in a political trade-off, the conservative right was granted a nationalistic composition, although Ebert continued to advocate the use of the third stanza only (as after World War II).

During the Nazi era, only the first stanza was used, followed by the SA song &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;. It was played at occasions of great national significance, such as the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, when Hitler and his entourage, along with Olympic officials, walked into the stadium amid a chorus of three thousand Germans singing &quot;&quot;. In this way, the first stanza became closely identified with the Nazi regime.

== Use after World War II ==
After its founding in 1949, West Germany did not have a national anthem for official events for some years, despite a growing need for one for the purpose of diplomatic procedures. In lieu of an official national anthem, popular German songs such as the &quot;Trizonesien-Song&quot;, a self-deprecating carnival song, were used at some sporting events. A variety of musical compositions was used or discussed, such as the finale of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, which is a musical setting of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s poem &quot;An die Freude&quot; (&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;). Though the black, red and gold colours of the national flag had been incorporated into Article 22 of the (West) German constitution, no national anthem had been specified. On 29 April 1952, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer asked President Theodor Heuss in a letter to accept &quot; as the national anthem, with only the third stanza to be sung on official occasions. However, the first and second stanzas were not outlawed, contrary to popular belief. President Heuss agreed to this on 2 May 1952. This exchange of letters was published in the Bulletin of the Federal Government. Since it was viewed as the traditional right of the President as head of state to set the symbols of the state, the &quot; thus became the national anthem.

Meanwhile, East Germany had adopted its own national anthem, &quot;Auferstanden aus Ruinen&quot; (&quot;Risen from Ruins&quot;). As the lyrics of this anthem called for &quot;Germany, united Fatherland&quot;, they were no longer officially used from approximately 1972 onwards, when East Germany abandoned its goal of uniting Germany under communism. By design, with slight adaptations, the lyrics of &quot; can be sung to the melody of the &quot; and vice versa.

In the 1970s and 1980s, efforts were made by conservatives in Germany to reclaim all three stanzas for the national anthem. The Christian Democratic Union of Baden-Württemberg, for instance, attempted twice (in 1985 and 1986) to require German high school students to study all three stanzas, and in 1989, CDU politician Christean Wagner decreed that all high school students in Hesse were to memorise the three stanzas.


On 7 March 1990, months before reunification, the Federal Constitutional Court declared only the third stanza of Hoffmann&#x27;s poem to be legally protected as a national anthem under German criminal law; Section 90a of the Criminal Code (&quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot;) makes defamation of the national anthem a crime, but does not specify what the national anthem is. This did not mean that stanzas one and two were no longer part of the national anthem, but that their peculiar status as &quot;part of the [national] anthem but unsung&quot; disqualified them for penal law protection, since the penal law must be interpreted in the narrowest manner possible.

In November 1991, President Richard von Weizsäcker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed in an exchange of letters to declare the third stanza alone to be the national anthem of the reunified republic. Hence, as of then, the national anthem of Germany is unmistakably the third stanza of the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, and only this stanza, set to Haydn&#x27;s music.

The incipit of the third stanza, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Unity and Justice and Freedom&#x27;), is widely considered to be the national motto of Germany, although it has never been officially proclaimed as such. It appears on Bundeswehr soldiers&#x27; belt buckles (replacing the earlier &quot;Gott mit uns&quot; (&#x27;God with us&#x27;) of the Imperial German Army and the Nazi-era Wehrmacht) and on 2 euro coins minted in Germany, and on the edges of the obsolete 2 and 5 Deutsche Mark coins.

== Criticisms ==
===Geographical===
The first stanza, which is no longer part of the national anthem and is not sung on official occasions, names three rivers and one strait – the Meuse (&quot;Maas&quot; in German), Adige (&quot;Etsch&quot;) and Neman (&quot;Memel&quot;) Rivers and the Little Belt strait. The song was written before German unification, and there was no intention to delineate borders of Germany as a nation-state. Nevertheless, these geographical references have been variously criticised as irredentist or misleading. Today, no part of any of these four natural boundaries lies in Germany. The Meuse and the Adige were parts of the German Confederation when the song was composed, and were no longer part of the German Reich as of 1871; the Little Belt strait and the Neman became German boundaries later (the Belt until 1920, and the Neman between 1920 and 1939).

None of these natural boundaries formed a distinct ethnic border. The Duchy of Schleswig (to which the Belt refers) was inhabited by both Germans and Danes, with the Danes forming a clear majority near the strait. Around the Adige there was a mix of German, Venetian and Gallo-Italian speakers, and the area around the Neman was not homogeneously German, but also accommodated Prussian Lithuanians. If taken as referencing the Duchy of Limburg, nominally part of the German Confederation for 28 years due to the political consequences of the Belgian Revolution then the Meuse was ethnically Dutch, with few Germans.

Nevertheless, such nationalistic rhetoric was relatively common in 19th-century public discourse. For example, Georg Herwegh in his poem &quot;The German Fleet&quot; (1841) gives the Germans as the people &quot;between the Po and the Sound,&quot; and in 1832 Philipp Jakob Siebenpfeiffer, a noted journalist, declared at the Hambach Festival that he considered all &quot;between the Alps and the North Sea&quot; to be &quot;Deutschtum&quot;, or the ethnic and spiritual German community.

===Textual===
The anthem has frequently been criticised for its generally nationalistic tone, the immodest geographic definition of Germany given in the first stanza, and an alleged male-chauvinistic attitude in the second stanza. A relatively early critic was Friedrich Nietzsche, who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza &quot;&quot; (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; said, &quot;—I fear that was the end of German philosophy&quot;. The pacifist Kurt Tucholsky was another critic, who published in 1929 a photo book sarcastically titled &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot;, criticising right-wing groups in Germany.

German grammar distinguishes between , i.e. above all else, and , meaning &quot;above everyone else&quot;. However, for propaganda purposes, the latter translation was endorsed by the Allies during World War I.

=== Modern use of the first stanza ===
As the first stanza of the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; is historically associated with the Nazi regime and its crimes, the singing of the first stanza is considered taboo within modern German society. Although the first stanza is not forbidden within Germany based on the German legal system, any mention of the first stanza is considered to be incorrect, inaccurate, and improper during official settings and functions, within Germany or abroad.

In 1974, the singer Nico released a recording of all three verses as the last track on her album The End.... In 1977, the German pop singer Heino produced a record of the song which included all three stanzas for use in primary schools in Baden-Württemberg. The inclusion of the first two stanzas was met with criticism at the time.

In 2009, the English rock musician Pete Doherty sang &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; live on radio at Bayerischer Rundfunk in Munich with all three stanzas. As he sang the first stanza, he was booed by the audience. Three days later, Doherty&#x27;s spokesperson declared that the singer was &quot;not aware of the historical background and regrets the misunderstanding&quot;. A spokesperson for Bayerischer Rundfunk welcomed the apology, noting that further cooperation with Doherty would not have been possible otherwise.

When the first stanza was played as the German national anthem at the canoe sprint world championships in Hungary in August 2011, German athletes were reportedly &quot;appalled&quot;. Eurosport, under the headline of &quot;Nazi anthem&quot;, erroneously reported that &quot;the first stanza of the piece [had been] banned in 1952 &quot;.

Similarly, in 2017, the first stanza was mistakenly sung by Will Kimble, an American soloist, during the welcome ceremony of the Fed Cup tennis match between Andrea Petkovic (Germany) and Alison Riske (U.S.) at the Center Court in Lahaina, Hawaii. In an attempt to drown out the soloist, German tennis players and fans began to sing the third stanza instead.

Also, in 2018, during the 2018 World Masters Athletics Championships in Málaga, Spain, the first stanza was mistakenly played when Thomas Stewens, a German athlete, won a gold medal in a decathlon. He instead sang the third stanza.

== Variants and additions ==

=== Additional or alternative stanzas ===
Hoffmann von Fallersleben also intended the text to be used as a drinking song; the second stanza&#x27;s toast to German wine, women and song is typical of this genre. The original Heligoland manuscript included a variant ending of the third stanza for such occasions:
An alternative version called &quot;&quot; (Children&#x27;s Hymn) was written by Bertolt Brecht shortly after his return from exile in the U.S. to a war-ravaged, bankrupt and geographically shrunken Germany at the end of World War II, and set to music by Hanns Eisler in the same year. It gained some currency after the 1990 unification of Germany, with a number of prominent Germans calling for his &quot;antihymn&quot; to be made official:

In the English version of this &quot;antihymn&quot;, the second stanza refers ambiguously to &quot;people&quot; and &quot;other folk&quot;, but the German version is more specific: the author encourages Germans to find ways to relieve the people of &quot;other&quot; nations from needing to flinch at the memory of things Germans have done in the past, so that people of other nations can feel ready to shake hands with a German again as they would with anyone else.

=== Notable performances and recordings ===
The German musician Nico sometimes performed the national anthem at concerts and dedicated it to militant Andreas Baader, leader of the Red Army Faction. She included a version of &quot;&quot; on her 1974 album &quot;The End...&quot;. In 2006, the Slovenian industrial band Laibach incorporated Hoffmann&#x27;s lyrics in a song titled &quot;Germania&quot;, on the album &quot;Volk&quot;, which contains fourteen songs with adaptations of national anthems.

=== Influences ===

The German composer Max Reger quotes the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; in the final section of his collection of organ pieces &quot;Sieben Stücke&quot;, Op. 145, composed in 1915–16 when it was a patriotic song but not yet the national anthem.

An Afrikaans patriotic song, &quot;Afrikaners Landgenote&quot;, has been written with an identical melody and similarly structured lyrics to the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;. The lyrics of this song consist of three stanzas, the first of which sets the boundaries of the Afrikaans homeland with the means of geographical areas, the second of which states the importance of &quot;Afrikaans mothers, daughters, sun, and field&quot;, recalling the &quot;German women, loyalty, wine, and song&quot;, and the third of which describes the importance of unity, justice, and freedom, along with love.

<doc id="8205" wikidata="Q16977" url="?curid=8205" title="Deng Xiaoping">
<text>Deng Xiaoping (22 August 190419 February 1997) was a Chinese statesman, revolutionary, and political theorist who served as the paramount leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1978 to 1989. In the aftermath of Mao Zedong&#x27;s death in 1976, Deng succeeded in consolidating power to lead China through a period of reform and opening up that transformed its economy into a socialist market economy. He is widely regarded as the &quot;Architect of Modern China&quot; for his contributions to socialism with Chinese characteristics and Deng Xiaoping Theory.

Born in Sichuan, the son of landowning peasants, Deng first learned of Marxism–Leninism while studying and working abroad in France in the early 1920s through the Work-Study Movement. In France, he met future collaborators like Zhou Enlai. In 1924, he joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and continued his studies in Moscow. Following the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and CCP, Deng worked in the Jiangxi Soviet, where he developed good relations with Mao. He served as a political commissar in the Chinese Red Army during the Long March and Second Sino-Japanese War, and later helped to lead the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) to victory in the civil war, participating in the PLA&#x27;s capture of Nanjing. After the proclamation of the PRC in 1949, Deng held several key regional roles, eventually rising to vice premier and CCP secretary-general in the 1950s. He presided over economic reconstruction efforts and played a significant role in the Anti-Rightist Campaign. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966, Deng was condemned as the party&#x27;s &quot;number two capitalist roader&quot; after Liu Shaoqi, and was purged twice by Mao, exiled to work in a tractor factory for 4 years. After Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, Deng outmaneuvered his rivals to become the country&#x27;s leader in 1978.

Upon coming to power, Deng began a massive overhaul of China&#x27;s infrastructure and political system. Due to the institutional disorder and political turmoil from the Mao era, he and his allies launched the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; program which sought to restore order by rehabilitating those who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. He also initiated a reform and opening up program that introduced elements of market capitalism to the Chinese economy by designating special economic zones within the country. In 1980, Deng embarked on a series of political reforms including the setting of constitutional term limits for state officials and other systematic revisions which were incorporated in the country&#x27;s fourth constitution. He later championed a one-child policy to deal with China&#x27;s perceived overpopulation crisis, helped establish China&#x27;s nine-year compulsory education, and oversaw the launch of the 863 Program to promote science and technology. The reforms carried out by Deng and his allies gradually led China away from a command economy and Maoist dogma, opened it up to foreign investments and technology, and introduced its vast labor force to the global market—thereby transforming China into one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing economies. Deng helped negotiate the eventual return of Hong Kong and Macau to China (which took place after his death) and developed the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; for their governance.

During the course of his leadership, Deng was named the &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year for 1978 and 1985. Despite his contributions to China&#x27;s modernization, Deng&#x27;s legacy is also marked by controversy. He ordered the military crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which ended his political reforms and remains a subject of global criticism. The one-child policy introduced in Deng&#x27;s era also drew criticism. Nonetheless, his policies laid the foundation for China&#x27;s emergence as a major global power. Deng was succeeded as paramount leader by Jiang Zemin, who continued his policies.

== Early life and family ==

Deng&#x27;s ancestors can be traced back to Jiaying County (now renamed as Meixian), Guangdong, a prominent ancestral area for the Hakka people, and had settled in Sichuan for several generations. Deng&#x27;s daughter Deng Rong wrote in the book &quot;My Father Deng Xiaoping&quot; () that his ancestry was probably, but not definitely, Hakka. Sichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty, but when the Qing dynasty planned to increase the population in 1671, they moved back to Sichuan. Deng was born in Guang&#x27;an District, Guang&#x27;an on 22 August 1904 in Sichuan province.

Deng&#x27;s father, Deng Wenming, was a mid-level landowner who had studied at the University of Law and Political Science in Chengdu, Sichuan. He was locally prominent. His mother, surnamed Dan, died early in Deng&#x27;s life, leaving Deng, his three brothers, and three sisters. At the age of five, Deng was sent to a traditional Chinese-style private primary school, followed by a more modern primary school at the age of seven.

Deng&#x27;s first wife, one of his schoolmates from Moscow, died aged 24 a few days after giving birth to their first child, a baby girl who also died. His second wife, Jin Weiying, left him after Deng came under political attack in 1933. His third wife, Zhuo Lin, was the daughter of an industrialist in Yunnan. She became a member of the Communist Party in 1938, and married Deng a year later in front of Mao&#x27;s cave dwelling in Yan&#x27;an. They had five children: three daughters (Deng Lin, Deng Nan and Deng Rong) and two sons (Deng Pufang and Deng Zhifang). Deng quit smoking when he was 86.

=== Education and early career ===

Deng&#x27;s given name was Xiansheng (). When Deng first attended school, his tutor objected to him having the given name Xiansheng, instead calling him &quot;Xixian&quot; (), which includes the characters &quot;to aspire to&quot; and &quot;goodness&quot;, with overtones of wisdom.

In the summer of 1919, Deng graduated from the Chongqing School. He and 80 schoolmates travelled by ship to France (travelling steerage) to participate in the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, a work-study program in which 4,001 Chinese would participate by 1927. Deng, the youngest of all the Chinese students in the group, had just turned 15. Wu Yuzhang, the local leader of the Movement in Chongqing, enrolled Deng and his paternal uncle, Deng Shaosheng, in the program. Deng&#x27;s father strongly supported his son&#x27;s participation in the work-study abroad program. The night before his departure, Deng&#x27;s father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn in France. He repeated the words he had learned from his teachers: &quot;To learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.&quot; Deng was aware that China was suffering greatly, and that the Chinese people must have a modern education to save their country.

On 19 October 1920, a French packet ship, the &quot;André Lebon&quot;, sailed into Marseille with 210 Chinese students aboard including Deng. The sixteen-year-old Deng briefly attended middle schools in Bayeux and Châtillon, but he spent most of his time in France working, including at a Renault factory and as a fitter at the Le Creusot Iron and Steel Plant in La Garenne-Colombes, a north-western suburb of Paris where he moved in April 1921. Coincidentally, when Deng&#x27;s later political fortunes were down and he was sent to work in a tractor factory in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution, he found himself a fitter again and proved to still be a master of the skill.

In La Garenne-Colombes Deng met future CCP leaders Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Li Fuchun, Li Lisan and Li Weihan. In June 1923 he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in Europe. In the second half of 1924, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and became one of the leading members of the General Branch of the Youth League in Europe. In 1926 Deng traveled to the Soviet Union and studied at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where one of his classmates was Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek.

=== Return to China ===
In late 1927, Deng left Moscow to return to the Republic of China, where he joined the army of Feng Yuxiang, a military leader in northwest China, who had requested assistance from the Soviet Union in his struggle with other local leaders in the region. At that time, the Soviet Union, through the Comintern, an international organization supporting the Communist movements, supported the Communists&#x27; alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT) party founded by Sun Yat-sen.

He arrived in Xi&#x27;an, the stronghold of Feng Yuxiang, in March 1927. He was part of the Fengtian clique&#x27;s attempt to prevent the break of the alliance between the KMT and the Communists. This split resulted in part from Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forcing them to flee areas controlled by the KMT. After the breakup of the alliance between Communists and Nationalists, Feng Yuxiang stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists who participated in their army, such as Deng Xiaoping, were forced to flee.

== Political rise ==

Although Deng got involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in China, the historian Mobo Gao has argued that &quot;Deng Xiaoping and many like him [in the Chinese Communist Party] were not really Marxists, but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see China standing on equal terms with the great global powers. They were primarily nationalists and they participated in the Communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find to Chinese nationalism.&quot;

=== Activism in Shanghai and Wuhan ===
After leaving the army of Feng Yuxiang in the northwest, Deng ended up in the city of Wuhan, where the Communists at that time had their headquarters. At that time, he began using the nickname &quot;Xiaoping&quot; and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus. He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder Chen Duxiu, and Qu Qiubai became the general secretary. In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party.

Between 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities. The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks.

Deng married Zhang Xiyuan, who died in 1930 during childbirth. The couple&#x27;s daughter also died during her birth.

=== Military campaign in Guangxi ===
From 1929 to 1931, Deng served as the chief representative of the Central Committee in Guangxi, where he helped lead the Baise and Longzhou Uprisings. Both at the time and later, Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s leadership during the rebellion has come under serious criticism. He followed the &quot;Li Lisan Line&quot; that called for aggressive attacks on cities. In practice, this meant that the rural soviet in Guangxi was abandoned and that the Seventh Red Army under Deng&#x27;s political leadership fought and lost several bloody battles. Eventually, Deng and the other Communist leaders in Guangxi decided to retreat to Jiangxi to join Mao Zedong. However, after a costly march across rough terrain, Deng left the army leaderless without prior authorization to do so. A Central Committee post-mortem in 1931 singled out Deng&#x27;s behavior as an example of &quot;rightist opportunism and a rich peasant line&quot;. In 1945, several former commanders of the Seventh Red Army spoke out against Deng for his actions during the uprising, although Mao Zedong protected Deng from any serious repercussions. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards learned about the events of the Baise Uprising and accused Deng of desertion. Deng admitted that leaving the army was one of the &quot;worst mistakes of [his] life&quot; and that &quot;although this action was allowed by the party, it was politically horribly wrong.&quot; Modern historians and biographers tend to agree. Uli Franz calls leaving the army a &quot;serious error&quot;. Benjamin Yang calls it a &quot;tragic failure and dark period in [Deng&#x27;s] political life.&quot; On the other hand, Diana Lary places blame for the disaster more broadly on the &quot;ineptitude&quot; of both the local leaders and the CCP Central Committee.

=== At the Jiangxi Soviet ===
The campaigns against the Communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the Comintern Soviet advisers, who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism. Contrary to the urban vision of the revolution, based on the Soviet experience, the Communist leader Mao Zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in China. In a mountainous area of Jiangxi province, where Mao went to establish a communist system, there developed the embryo of a future state of China under communism, which adopted the official name of the Chinese Soviet Republic (CSR) and which included the Jiangxi Soviet.

In August 1931, Deng went to Ruijin, which became the capital of the CSR, and became secretary of its Party Committee in the summer of 1931. In the winter of 1932, Deng went on to play the same position in the nearby district of Huichang. In 1933 he became director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi.

As a supporter of Mao, Deng was criticized by elements of the Party which opposed Mao and was removed from his position in 1933. During Deng&#x27;s 1933 political setbacks, his wife Jin Weiying deserted him for one of his political opponents.

The CSR reached its peak in 1933. The CSR had a central government as well as local and regional governments. It operated institutions including an education system and court system. The CSR also issued currency. It governed a population which exceeded 3.4 million in an area of approximately 70,000 square kilometers (although the isolated soviets were never connected into one contiguous piece of territory). The CSR was defeated by Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists, leading to the Long March.

=== Long March ===
Surrounded by the more powerful nationalist army, the Communists fled Jiangxi in October 1934. Thus began the epic movement that would mark a turning point in the development of Chinese communism. The evacuation was difficult because the Army of the nationalists had taken positions in all areas occupied by the Communists. Advancing through remote and mountainous terrain, some 100,000 men managed to escape Jiangxi, starting a long strategic retreat through the interior of China, which ended one year later when between 8,000 and 9,000 survivors reached the northern province of Shaanxi.

During the Zunyi Conference at the beginning of the Long March, the so-called 28 Bolsheviks, led by Bo Gu and Wang Ming, were ousted from power and Mao Zedong, to the dismay of the Soviet Union, became the new leader of the Chinese Communist Party. The pro-Soviet Chinese Communist Party had ended and a new rural-inspired party emerged under the leadership of Mao. Deng had once again become a leading figure in the party.

The confrontation between the two parties was temporarily interrupted, however, by the Japanese invasion, forcing the Kuomintang to form an alliance for the second time with the Communists to defend the nation against external aggression.

=== Japanese invasion ===
The invasion of Japanese troops in 1937 marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the invasion, Deng remained in the area controlled by the Communists in the north, where he assumed the role of deputy political director of the three divisions of the restructured Communist army. From September 1937 until January 1938, he lived in Buddhist monasteries and temples in the Wutai Mountains. In January 1938, he was appointed as Political Commissar of the 129th division of the Eighth Route Army commanded by Liu Bocheng, starting a long-lasting partnership with Liu.

Deng stayed for most of the conflict with the Japanese in the war front in the area bordering the provinces of Shanxi, Henan and Hebei, then traveled several times to the city of Yan&#x27;an, where Mao had established the basis for Communist Party leadership. While in Henan, he delivered the famous report, &quot;The Victorious Situation of Leaping into the Central Plains and Future Policies and Strategies&quot;, at a Gospel Hall where he lived for some time. In one of his trips to Yan&#x27;an in 1939, he married, for the third and last time in his life, Zhuo Lin, a young native of Kunming, who, like other young idealists of the time, had traveled to Yan&#x27;an to join the Communists.

Deng was considered a &quot;revolutionary veteran&quot; because of his participation in the Long March. He took a leading role in the Hundred Regiments Offensive which boosted his standing among his comrades.

=== Resumed war against the Nationalists ===
After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, Deng traveled to Chongqing, the city in which Chiang Kai-shek established his government during the Japanese invasion, to participate in peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The results of those negotiations were not positive and military confrontation between the two antagonistic parties resumed shortly after the meeting in Chongqing.

While Chiang Kai-shek re-established the government in Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, the Communists were fighting for control in the field. Following up with guerrilla tactics from their positions in rural areas against cities under the control of the government of Chiang and their supply lines, the Communists were increasing the territory under their control, and incorporating more and more soldiers who had deserted the Nationalist army.

Deng played a major part in the Huaihai Campaign against the nationalists.

In the final phase of the war, Deng again exercised a key role as political leader and propaganda master as Political Commissar of the 2nd Field Army commanded by Liu Bocheng where he was instrumental in the PLA&#x27;s march into Tibet. He also participated in disseminating the ideas of Mao Zedong, which turned into the ideological foundation of the Communist Party. His political and ideological work, along with his status as a veteran of the Long March, placed him in a privileged position within the party to occupy positions of power after the Communist Party managed to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and founded the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Political career under Mao ==

=== Local leadership ===
On 1 October 1949, Deng attended the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Beijing. At that time, the Communist Party controlled the entire north, but there were still parts of the south held by the Kuomintang regime. He became responsible for leading the pacification of southwest China, in his capacity as the first secretary of the Department of the Southwest. This organization had the task of managing the final takeover of that part of the country still held by the Kuomintang; Tibet remained independent for another year.

The Kuomintang government was being forced to leave Guangzhou (Canton), and established Chongqing (Chungking) as a new provisional capital. There, Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, a former classmate of Deng in Moscow, wanted to stop the advance of the Communist Party forces.

Under the political control of Deng, the Communist army took over Chongqing in late November 1949 and entered Chengdu, the last bastion of power of Chiang Kai-shek, a few days later. At that time Deng became mayor of Chongqing, while he simultaneously was the leader of the Communist Party in the southwest, where the Communist army, now proclaiming itself the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, suppressed resistance loyal to the old Kuomintang regime. In 1950, the Communist Party-ruled state also seized control over Tibet.

In a 1951 speech to cadres preparing to supervise campaigns in the land reform movement, Deng instructed that while cadres should help peasants carry out nonviolent &quot;speak reason struggle&quot;, they also had to remember that as a mass movement, land reform was not a time to be &quot;refined and gentle&quot;. Expressing his view as a rhetorical question, Deng stated that while ideally no landlords would die in the process, &quot;If some tightfisted landlords hang themselves, does that mean our policies are wrong? Are we responsible?&quot;

Deng Xiaoping would spend three years in Chongqing, the city where he had studied in his teenage years before going to France. In 1952 he moved to Beijing, where he occupied different positions in the central government.

=== Political rise in Beijing ===

In July 1952, Deng came to Beijing to assume the posts of Vice Premier and Deputy Chair of the Committee on Finance. Soon after, he took the posts of Minister of Finance and Director of the Office of Communications. In 1954, he was removed from all these positions, holding only the post of Vice Premier. In 1956, he became Head of the Communist Party&#x27;s Organization Department and member of the Central Military Commission.

After officially supporting Mao Zedong in his Anti-Rightist Movement of 1957, Deng acted as Secretary-General of the Secretariat and ran the country&#x27;s daily affairs with President Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai. Deng and Liu&#x27;s policies emphasized economics over ideological dogma, an implicit departure from the mass fervor of the Great Leap Forward. Both Liu and Deng supported Mao in the mass campaigns of the 1950s, in which they attacked the bourgeois and capitalists, and promoted Mao&#x27;s ideology. However, the failure of the Great Leap Forward was seen as an indictment on Mao&#x27;s ability to manage the economy. Peng Dehuai began openly criticizing Mao, while Liu and Deng maintained a more cautious tone, ultimately taking charge of economic policy as Mao ceased to be involved in the day-to-day affairs of the party and state. Mao agreed to cede the presidency (the de jure head of state position) to Liu, while retaining his leadership positions in the party and army.

In 1955, he was considered as a candidate for the PLA rank of Marshal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China but he was ultimately not awarded the rank.

At the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1956, Deng supported removing all references to &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot; from the party statutes.

In 1963, Deng traveled to Moscow to lead a meeting of the Chinese delegation with Stalin&#x27;s successor, Nikita Khrushchev. Relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union had worsened since the death of Stalin. After this meeting, no agreement was reached and the Sino–Soviet split was consummated; there was an almost total suspension of relations between the two major communist powers of the time.

After the &quot;Seven Thousand Cadres Conference&quot; in 1962, Liu and Deng&#x27;s economic reforms of the early 1960s were generally popular and restored many of the economic institutions previously dismantled during the Great Leap Forward. Mao, sensing his loss of prestige, took action to regain control of the state. Appealing to his revolutionary spirit, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution, which encouraged the masses to root out the right-wing capitalists who had &quot;infiltrated the party&quot;. Deng was ridiculed as the &quot;number two capitalist roader&quot;.

Deng was one of the primary drafters of the Third Five Year Plan. In draft form, it emphasized a consumer focus and further development in China&#x27;s more industrialized coastal cities. When Mao argued for a massive campaign to develop basic and national security industry in China&#x27;s interior as a Third Front in case of invasion by the United States or Soviet Union, Deng was among the key leadership that did not support the idea. Following increased concerns of attack from the United States after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Deng and other key leadership ultimately supported the Third Front construction, and the focus of the Third Year Plan changed to industrialization of the interior.

=== Purged twice ===
==== Cultural Revolution ====

Mao feared that the reformist economic policies of Deng and Liu could lead to restoration of capitalism and end the Chinese Revolution. For this and other reasons, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, during which Deng fell out of favor and was forced to retire from all his positions.

During the Cultural Revolution, he and his family were targeted by Red Guards, who imprisoned Deng&#x27;s eldest son, Deng Pufang. Deng Pufang was tortured and jumped out, or was thrown out, of the window of a four-story building in 1968, becoming a paraplegic. In October 1969 Deng Xiaoping was sent to the Xinjian County Tractor Factory in rural Jiangxi province to work as a regular worker. He operated a lathe. In his four years there, Deng spent his spare time writing. He was purged nationally, but to a lesser scale than President Liu Shaoqi.

In 1971, Mao&#x27;s second official successor and the sole Vice Chairman of the party, Lin Biao, was killed in an air crash. According to official reports, Lin was trying to flee from China after a failed coup against Mao. Mao purged all of Lin&#x27;s allies, who made up nearly all of the senior ranks of the PLA, leaving Deng (who had been political commissar of the 2nd Field Army during the civil war) the most influential of the remaining army leaders. In the time that followed, Deng wrote to Mao twice to say that he had learned a lesson from the Lin Biao incident, admitted that he had &quot;capitalist trends&quot; and did not &quot;hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought&quot;, and expressed the hope that he could work for the Party to make up for his mistakes. 

Mao sought Deng to take over for Zhou Enlai, who was seriously ill. On 14 August 1972, Mao wrote that Deng had made serious mistakes, but noted that Deng had been politically attacked for supporting Mao in 1933 and had been loyal. In February 1973, Deng returned to Beijing, after Zhou brought him back from exile in order for Deng to focus on reconstructing the Chinese economy. Zhou was also able to convince Mao to bring Deng back into politics in October 1974 as First Vice-Premier, in practice running daily affairs. He remained careful, however, to avoid contradicting Maoist ideology on paper. In January 1975, he was additionally elected Vice Chairman of the party by the 10th Central Committee for the first time in his party career; Li Desheng had to resign in his favour. Deng was one of five Vice Chairmen, with Zhou being the First Vice Chairman.

During his brief ascendency in 1973, Deng established the Political Research Office, headed by intellectuals Hu Qiaomu, Yu Guangyuan and Hu Sheng, delegated to explore approaches to political and economic reforms. He led the group himself and managed the project within the State Council, in order to avoid rousing the suspicions of the Gang of Four.

In 1975, Deng sought to re-orient Chinese Academy of Sciences towards more theoretical research, which had not been a focus during the Cultural Revolution. Deng described scientific research in China as lagging behind the needs of socialist construction and the state of the advanced countries, and stated that to catch up, China should emphasize basic science in order to develop a sound theoretical foundation. Although this approach fell out of political favor when Deng was purged, Deng&#x27;s approach to balancing applied and basic research was adopted as CAS&#x27;s official policy in June 1977.

The Cultural Revolution was not yet over, and a radical leftist political group known as the Gang of Four, led by Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing, competed for power within the Party. The Gang saw Deng as their greatest challenge to power. Mao, too, was suspicious that Deng would destroy the positive reputation of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao considered one of his greatest policy initiatives. Beginning in late 1975, Deng was asked to draw up a series of self-criticisms. Although he admitted to having taken an &quot;inappropriate ideological perspective&quot; while dealing with state and party affairs, he was reluctant to admit that his policies were wrong in essence. His antagonism with the Gang of Four became increasingly clear, and Mao seemed to lean in the Gang&#x27;s favour. Mao refused to accept Deng&#x27;s self-criticisms and asked the party&#x27;s Central Committee to &quot;discuss Deng&#x27;s mistakes thoroughly&quot;.

==== &quot;Criticize Deng&quot; campaign ====

Zhou Enlai died in January 1976, to an outpouring of national grief. Zhou was a very important figure in Deng&#x27;s political life, and his death eroded his remaining support within the Party&#x27;s Central Committee. After Deng delivered Zhou&#x27;s official eulogy at the state funeral, the Gang of Four, with Mao&#x27;s permission, began the &quot;Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal-of-Verdicts Trend&quot; campaign. Hua Guofeng, not Deng, was selected to become Zhou&#x27;s successor as Premier on 4 February 1976.

On 2 February 1976, the Central Committee issued a Top-Priority Directive, officially transferring Deng to work on &quot;external affairs&quot; and thus removing him from the party&#x27;s power apparatus. Deng stayed at home for several months, awaiting his fate. The Political Research Office was promptly dissolved, and Deng&#x27;s advisers such as Yu Guangyuan were suspended. As a result, the political turmoil halted the economic progress Deng had labored for in the past year. On 3 March, Mao issued a directive reaffirming the legitimacy of the Cultural Revolution and specifically pointed to Deng as an internal, rather than external, problem. This was followed by a Central Committee directive issued to all local party organs to study Mao&#x27;s directive and criticize Deng.

Deng&#x27;s reputation as a reformer suffered a severe blow when the Qingming Festival, after the mass public mourning of Zhou on a traditional Chinese holiday, culminated in the Tiananmen Incident on 5 April 1976, an event the Gang of Four deemed counter-revolutionary and threatening to their power. Furthermore, the Gang deemed Deng the mastermind behind the incident, and Mao himself wrote that &quot;the nature of things has changed&quot;. Deng was removed from all party roles and moved to a house east to Tiananmen Square.

As a result, On 6 April 1976 Premier Hua Guofeng was also appointed to Deng&#x27;s position as Vice Chairman and at the same time received the vacant position of First Vice Chairman, which Zhou had held, making him Mao&#x27;s fourth official successor.

== Leadership of China (1978-1989) ==
=== Paramount leader ===

Following Mao&#x27;s death on 9 September 1976 and the purge of the Gang of Four in October 1976, Premier Hua Guofeng succeeded as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and gradually emerged as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of China. Prior to Mao&#x27;s death, the only governmental position Deng held was that of First Vice Premier of the State Council, but Hua Guofeng wanted to rid the Party of extremists and successfully marginalised the Gang of Four. On 22 July 1977, Deng was restored to the posts of vice-chairman of the Central Committee, Vice-chairman of the Military Commission and Chief of the General Staff of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

By carefully mobilizing his supporters within the party, Deng outmaneuvered Hua, who had pardoned him, then ousted Hua from his top leadership positions by 1980. In contrast to previous leadership changes, Deng allowed Hua to retain membership in the Central Committee and quietly retire, helping to set the precedent that losing a high-level leadership struggle would not result in physical harm.

During his paramount leadership, his official state positions were Chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference from 1978 to 1983 and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (an &quot;ad hoc&quot; body comprising the most senior members of the party elite) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1983 to 1990, while his official party positions were Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party from 1977 to 1982, Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party from 1981 to 1989 and Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission from 1982 to 1987. He was offered the rank of General First Class in 1988 when the PLA restored military ranks, but as in 1955, he once again declined. Even after retiring from the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1987 and the Central Military Commission in 1989, Deng continued to exert influence over China&#x27;s policies until his death in 1997.

Important decisions were always taken in Deng&#x27;s home at No. 11 Miliangku Hutong with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called &quot;Eight Elders&quot;, especially with Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. Despite Deng&#x27;s recognition as paramount leader, in practice these elders governed China as a small collective leadership. Deng ruled as &quot;paramount leader&quot; although he never held the top title of the party, and was able to successively remove three party leaders, including Hu Yaobang. Deng stepped down from the Central Committee and its Politburo Standing Committee. However, he remained as the chairman of the State and Party&#x27;s Central Military Commission and was still seen as the paramount leader of China rather than General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Presidents Li Xiannian and Yang Shangkun.

=== Boluan Fanzheng ===

Deng repudiated the Cultural Revolution and, in 1977, launched the &quot;Beijing Spring&quot;, which allowed open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the period, and restored the National College Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) which had been cancelled for ten years during the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile, he was the impetus for the abolition of the class background system. Under this system, the CCP removed employment barriers to Chinese deemed to be associated with the former landlord class; its removal allowed a faction favoring the restoration of the private market to enter the Communist Party.

Deng gradually outmaneuvered his political opponents. By encouraging public criticism of the Cultural Revolution, he weakened the position of those who owed their political positions to that event, while strengthening the position of those like himself who had been purged during that time. Deng also received a great deal of popular support. As Deng gradually consolidated control over the CCP, Hua was replaced by Zhao Ziyang as premier in 1980, and by Hu Yaobang as party chairman in 1981, despite the fact that Hua was Mao Zedong&#x27;s designated successor as the &quot;paramount leader&quot; of the Chinese Communist Party and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. During the Boluan Fanzheng period, the Cultural Revolution was invalidated, and victims of more than 3 million &quot;unjust, false, wrongful cases&quot; by 1976 were officially rehabilitated.

Deng&#x27;s elevation to China&#x27;s new number-one figure meant that the historical and ideological questions around Mao Zedong had to be addressed properly. Because Deng wished to pursue deep reforms, it was not possible for him to continue Mao&#x27;s hard-line &quot;class struggle&quot; policies and mass public campaigns. In 1982 the Central Committee of the Communist Party released a document entitled &quot;Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;. Mao retained his status as a &quot;great Marxist, proletarian revolutionary, militarist, and general&quot;, and the undisputed founder and pioneer of the country and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. &quot;His accomplishments must be considered before his mistakes&quot;, the document declared. Deng personally commented that Mao was &quot;seven parts good, three parts bad&quot;. The document also steered the prime responsibility of the Cultural Revolution away from Mao (although it did state that &quot;Mao mistakenly began the Cultural Revolution&quot;) to the &quot;counter-revolutionary cliques&quot; of the Gang of Four and Lin Biao.

=== International affairs ===
Deng prioritized China&#x27;s modernization and opening up to the outside world, stating that China&#x27;s &quot;strategy in foreign affairs is to seek a peaceful environment&quot; for the Four Modernizations. Under Deng&#x27;s leadership, China opened up to the outside world, to learn from more advanced countries. Deng developed the principle that in foreign affairs, China should keep a low-profile and bide its time. He continued to seek an independent position between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although Deng retained control over key national security decisions, he also delegated power to bureaucrats in routine matters, ratifying consensus decisions and stepping in if a bureaucratic consensus could not be reached. In contrast to the Mao-era, Deng involved more parties in foreign policy decision-making, decentralizing the foreign policy bureaucracy. This decentralized approach led to consideration of a number of interests and views, but also fragmentation of policy institutions and extensive bargaining between different bureaucratic units during the policy-making process.

In November 1978, after the country had stabilized following political turmoil, Deng visited Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and met with Singapore&#x27;s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Deng was very impressed with Singapore&#x27;s economic development, greenery and housing, and later sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge. Lee Kuan Yew, on the other hand, advised Deng to stop exporting Communist ideologies to Southeast Asia, advice that according to Lee, Deng later followed. In late 1978, the aerospace company Boeing announced the sale of 747 aircraft to various airlines in the PRC, and the beverage company Coca-Cola made public their intention to open a production plant in Shanghai.

On 1 January 1979, the United States recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China, leaving the (Taiwan) Republic of China&#x27;s nationalist government to one side, and business contacts between China and the West began to grow.

In early 1979, Deng undertook an official visit to the United States, meeting President Jimmy Carter in Washington as well as several Congressmen. The Chinese insisted that former President Richard Nixon be invited to the formal White House reception, a symbolic indication of their assertiveness on the one hand, and their desire to continue with the Nixon initiatives on the other. As part of the discussions with Carter, Deng sought United States approval for China&#x27;s contemplated invasion of Vietnam in the Sino-Vietnamese war. According to United States National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter reserved judgment, an action which Chinese diplomats interpreted as tacit approval, and China launched the invasion shortly after Deng&#x27;s return.

During the visit, Deng visited the Johnson Space Center in Houston, as well as the headquarters of Coca-Cola and Boeing in Atlanta and Seattle, respectively. With these visits so significant, Deng made it clear that the new Chinese regime&#x27;s priorities were economic and technological development.

Deng took personal charge of the final negotiations with the United States on normalizing foreign relations between the two countries. In response to criticism from within the Party regarding his United States policy, Deng wrote, &quot;I am presiding over the work on the United States. If there are problems, I take full responsibility.&quot;

Sino-Japanese relations improved significantly. Deng used Japan as an example of a rapidly progressing power that set a good example for China economically.

Deng initially continued to adhere to the Maoist line of the Sino–Soviet split era that the Soviet Union was a superpower as &quot;hegemonic&quot; as the United States, but even more threatening to China because of its close proximity. Relations with the Soviet Union improved after Mikhail Gorbachev took over the Kremlin in 1985, and formal relations between the two countries were finally restored at the 1989 Sino-Soviet Summit.

Deng responded to the Western sanctions following the Tiananmen Square protests by adopting the &quot;twenty-four character guidelines&quot; for China&#x27;s international affairs: observe carefully (冷静观察), secure China&#x27;s positions (稳住阵脚), calmly cope with the challenges (沉着应付), hide China&#x27;s capacities and bide its time (韬光养晦), be good at maintaining a low profile (善于守拙), and never claim leadership (绝不当头).

The end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union removed the original motives underlying rapprochement between China and the United States. Deng was motivated by concerns that the United States might curtail support for China&#x27;s modernization, and adopted a low-profile foreign policy to live with the fact of United States hegemony and focus primarily on domestic development. In this period of its foreign policy, China focused on building good relations with its neighbors and actively participating in multi-lateral institutions. As academic Suisheng Zhao writes in evaluating Deng&#x27;s foreign policy legacy, &quot;Deng&#x27;s developmental diplomacy helped create a favorable external environment for China&#x27;s rise in the twenty-first century. His hand-picked successors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, faithfully followed his course.&quot;

In 1990 when he met Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau he stated &quot;The key principle governing the new international order should be noninterference in other countries’ internal affairs and social systems. It won&#x27;t work to require all the countries in the world to copy the patterns set by the United States, Britain and France.&quot; Deng championed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence stating that they should be used as the &quot;guiding norms of international relations&quot;.

=== Reform and Opening-up ===
At the outset of China&#x27;s reform and opening up, Deng set out the Four Cardinal Principles that had to be maintained in the process: (1) the leadership of the Communist Party, (2) the socialist road, (3) Marxism, and (4) the dictatorship of the proletariat. Overall, reform proceeded gradually, with Deng delegating specific issues to proteges such as Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang, who in turn addressed them under the guiding principle of &quot;seeking truth from facts&quot; - meaning that the correctness of an approach had to be gauged by its economic results. Deng described reform and opening up as a &quot;large scale experiment&quot; requiring thorough &quot;experimentation in practice&quot; instead of textbook knowledge.

In Deng&#x27;s view, socialism could not be considered superior to capitalism unless it improved the lives of the people in material ways. During Reform and Opening-up, he criticized those he deemed as the ideologues of the Cultural Revolution for seeking &quot;poor socialism&quot; and &quot;poor communism&quot; and believing that communism was a &quot;spiritual thing&quot;. In 1979, Deng stated, &quot;Socialism cannot endure if it remains poor. If we want to uphold Marxism and socialism in the international class struggle, we have to demonstrate that the Marxist system of thought is superior to all others, and that the socialist system is superior to capitalism&quot;.

==== Four modernizations ====

Deng quoted the old proverb &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat&quot;, which summarizes his pragmatic &quot;cat theory&quot;. The point was that capitalistic methods worked. Deng worked with his team, especially as Zhao Ziyang, who in 1980 replaced Hua Guofeng as premier, and Hu Yaobang, who in 1981 did the same with the post of party chairman. Deng thus took the reins of power and began to emphasize the goals of &quot;four modernizations&quot; (economy, agriculture, scientific and technological development and national defense). He announced an ambitious plan of opening and liberalizing the economy.

The last position of power retained by Hua Guofeng, chairman of the Central Military Commission, was taken by Deng in 1981. However, progress toward military modernization went slowly. A border war with Vietnam in 1977–1979 made major changes unwise. The war puzzled outside observers, but Xiaoming Zhang argues that Deng had multiple goals: stopping Soviet expansion in the region, obtain American support for his four modernizations, and mobilizing China for reform and integration into the world economy. Deng also sought to strengthen his control of the PLA, and demonstrate to the world that China was capable of fighting a real war. Zhang thinks punishment of Vietnam for its invasion of Cambodia was a minor factor. In the event, the Chinese forces did poorly, in terms of equipment, strategy, leadership, and battlefield performance. Deng subsequently used the PLA&#x27;s poor performance to overcome resistance by military leaders to his military reforms.

China&#x27;s primary military threat came from the Soviet Union, which was much more powerful despite having fewer soldiers, owing to its more advanced weapons technology. In March 1981, Deng deemed a military exercise necessary for the PLA, and in September, the North China Military Exercise took place, becoming the largest exercise conducted by the PLA since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic. Moreover, Deng initiated the modernization of the PLA and decided that China first had to develop an advanced civilian scientific infrastructure before it could hope to build modern weapons. He therefore concentrated on downsizing the military, cutting 1 million troops in 1985 (百万大裁军), retiring the elderly and corrupt senior officers and their cronies. He emphasized the recruitment of much better educated young men who would be able to handle the advanced technology when it finally arrived. Instead of patronage and corruption in the officer corps, he imposed strict discipline in all ranks. In 1982 he established a new Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense to plan for using technology developed in the civilian sector.

==== Three steps to economic development ====
In 1986, Deng explained to Mike Wallace on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that some people and regions could become prosperous first in order to bring about common prosperity faster. In October 1987, at the Plenary Session of the National People&#x27;s Congress, Deng was re-elected as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, but he resigned as Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission and was succeeded by Chen Yun. Deng continued to chair and develop the reform and opening up as the main policy, and he advanced the three steps suitable for China&#x27;s economic development strategy within seventy years: the first step, to double the 1980 GNP and ensure that the people have enough food and clothing, was attained by the end of the 1980s; the second step, to quadruple the 1980 GNP by the end of the 20th century, was achieved in 1995 ahead of schedule; the third step, to increase per capita GNP to the level of the medium-developed countries by 2050, at which point, the Chinese people will be fairly well-off and modernization will be basically realized.

==== Further reforms ====

Improving relations with the outside world was the second of two important philosophical shifts outlined in Deng&#x27;s program of reform termed &quot;Gaige Kaifang&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Reforms and Openness). China&#x27;s domestic social, political, and most notably, economic systems would undergo significant changes during Deng&#x27;s time. The goals of Deng&#x27;s reforms were summed up by the Four Modernizations, those of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military.

The strategy for achieving these aims of becoming a modern, industrial nation was the socialist market economy. Deng argued that China was in the primary stage of socialism and that the duty of the party was to perfect so-called &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;, and &quot;seek truth from facts&quot;. (This somewhat resembles the Leninist theoretical justification of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in the 1920s, which argued that the Soviet Union had not gone deeply enough into the capitalist phase and therefore needed limited capitalism in order to fully evolve its means of production.) The &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; settles a benign structure for the implementation of ethnic policy and forming a unique method of ethnic theory.

Deng&#x27;s economic policy prioritized developing China&#x27;s productive forces. In Deng&#x27;s view, this development &quot;is the most fundamental revolution from the viewpoint of historical development[,]&quot; and &quot;[p]oor socialism&quot; is not socialism. His theoretical justification for allowing market forces was:

Unlike Hua Guofeng, Deng believed that no policy should be rejected outright simply because it was not associated with Mao. Unlike more conservative leaders such as Chen Yun, Deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to ones that were found in capitalist nations.

This political flexibility towards the foundations of socialism is strongly supported by quotes such as:

Although Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, the general consensus amongst historians is that few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself. Premier Zhou Enlai, for example, pioneered the Four Modernizations years before Deng. In addition, many reforms would be introduced by local leaders, often not sanctioned by central government directives. If successful and promising, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas and ultimately introduced nationally. An often cited example is the household responsibility system, which was first secretly implemented by a poor rural village at the risk of being convicted as &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. This experiment proved very successful. Deng openly supported it and it was later adopted nationally. Many other reforms were influenced by the experiences of the East Asian Tigers.

This was in sharp contrast to the pattern of &quot;perestroika&quot; undertaken by Mikhail Gorbachev, in which most major reforms originated with Gorbachev himself. The bottom-up approach of Deng&#x27;s reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of &quot;perestroika&quot;, was likely a key factor in the success of the former.

Deng&#x27;s reforms actually included the introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao&#x27;s mass campaign style of economic construction. However, unlike the Soviet model, management was indirect through market mechanisms. Deng sustained Mao&#x27;s legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market value.

Under Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s leadership, the Cultural Revolution-era trend towards localizing authority over state-owned enterprises was reversed, and SOE management was again centralized.

==== Export focus ====
In the move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng&#x27;s reforms shifted China&#x27;s development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and export-led growth. Light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base. With the short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign-exchange export earnings, revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments.

However, in sharp contrast to the similar, but much less successful reforms in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, these investments were not government mandated. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect, thus making them more or less independent from government interference. In short, Deng&#x27;s reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China.

These reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of economic self-reliance. China decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West. In October 1978, to exchange the instruments of ratification for the &quot;Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, Deng Xiaoping visited Japan for the first time and was warmly received by Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda and others. Deng Xiaoping was only Vice Premier during the time of his meetings with Japanese officials, but the Japanese government received Deng as the effective paramount leader of China due to his long history with the CCP, nonetheless. Deng was deemed the first Chinese leader to receive an audience in addition to Japanese Emperor Showa. A news article from NHK Japan in 1978 reported that Deng diplomatically stated &quot;we talked about our past, but His Majesty&#x27;s focus on building a better future is something I noticed.&quot; Deng’s statement suggests the new era of China’s political reform through foreign economic diplomacy. 

Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China is an ongoing pact between the two nations to this day. Article 1 of the treaty describes mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, and mutual non-interference in internal affairs. Article 2 proclaims anti-hegemony. Article 3 discusses the further development of economic and cultural relations between the two countries, and Article 4 addresses the relationship of this treaty with third countries. Although it took six years from the restoration of diplomatic relations for the peace treaty negotiations to be concluded as the &quot;anti-hegemony&quot; clause and the &quot;third country&quot; clause were considered the most contentious, the agreement still informs much of contemporary Sino-Japanese relations. By participating in such export-led growth, China was able to step up the Four Modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds, market, advanced technologies and management experiences, thus accelerating its economic development. From 1980, Deng attracted foreign companies to a series of Special Economic Zones, where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged.

The reforms sought to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants&#x27; homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.

There are some parallels between Deng&#x27;s market socialism especially in the early stages, and Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s NEP as well as those of Nikolai Bukharin&#x27;s economic policies, in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning. As academics Christopher Marquis and Kunyuan Qiao observe, Deng had been present in the Soviet Union when Lenin implemented the NEP, and it is reasonable to infer that it may have impacted Deng&#x27;s view that markets could exist within socialism. In first meeting between Deng and Armand Hammer, Deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in Lenin&#x27;s Soviet Union for as much information on the new economic policy as possible.

=== Return of Hong Kong and Macau ===

From 1980 onwards, Deng led the expansion of the economy, and in political terms took over negotiations with the United Kingdom to return Hong Kong, meeting personally with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher had participated in the meetings with the hopes of keeping British rule over Hong Kong Island and Kowloon—two of the three constituent territories of the colony—but this was firmly rejected by Deng. The result of these negotiations was the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed on 19 December 1984, which formally outlined the United Kingdom&#x27;s return of the whole Hong Kong colony to China by 1997. The Chinese government pledged to respect the economic system and civil liberties of the British colony for fifty years after the handover.

Deng&#x27;s theory of one country, two systems applied to Hong Kong and Macau and Deng intended to also present it as an attractive option to the people of Taiwan for eventual incorporation of that island, where sovereignty over the territory is still disputed. In 1982, Deng first explained the concept of one country, two systems in relation to Taiwan.

Deng&#x27;s statements during the 1987 drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong showed his view of the principle in the Hong Kong context. At that time, Deng stated that the central government would not intervene in the daily business of Hong Kong, but predicted Hong Kong would sometimes have issues affecting national interests that would require the central government&#x27;s involvement. Deng said, &quot;after 1997, we shall still allow people in Hong Kong to attack the Communist Party of China and China verbally, but what if the words were turned into action, trying to convert Hong Kong into a base of opposition to the Chinese mainland under the pretext of &#x27;democracy&#x27;? Then there’s no choice but intervention.&quot; In June 1988, Deng stated that &quot;Hong Kong&#x27;s political system today is neither the British system nor the American system, and it should not transplant the Western ways in the future.&quot;

=== Population control and crime control ===

China&#x27;s rapid economic growth presented several problems. The 1982 census revealed the extraordinary growth of the population, which already exceeded a billion people. Deng continued the plans initiated by Hua Guofeng to restrict birth to only one child, limiting women to one child under pain of administrative penalty. The policy applied to urban areas, and included forced abortions.

In August 1983, Deng launched the &quot;Strike hard&quot; Anti-crime Campaign due to the worsening public safety after the Cultural Revolution. It was reported that the government set quotas for 5,000 executions by mid-November, and sources in Taiwan claimed that as many as 60,000 people were executed in that time, although more recent estimates have placed the number at 24,000 who were sentenced to death (mostly in the first &quot;battle&quot; of the campaign). A number of people arrested (some even received death penalty) were children or relatives of government officials at various levels, including the grandson of Zhu De, demonstrating the principle of &quot;all are equal before the law&quot;. The campaign had an immediate positive effect on public safety, while controversies also arose such as whether some of the legal punishments were too harsh and whether the campaign had long-term positive effect on public safety.

Increasing economic freedom was being translated into a greater freedom of opinion, and critics began to arise within the system, including the famous dissident Wei Jingsheng, who coined the term &quot;fifth modernization&quot; in reference to democracy as a missing element in the renewal plans of Deng Xiaoping. In the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime and growing inequalities caused the biggest crisis to Deng&#x27;s leadership.

=== Crackdown of Tiananmen Square protests ===
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, culminating in the June Fourth Massacre, were a series of demonstrations in and near Tiananmen Square in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) between 15 April and 5 June 1989, a year in which many other communist governments collapsed.

The protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, a reformist official backed by Deng but ousted by the Eight Elders and the conservative wing of the politburo. Many people were dissatisfied with the party&#x27;s slow response and relatively subdued funeral arrangements. Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and universities in the surrounding areas. In Beijing, this was centered on the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes in Tiananmen Square. The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the &quot;old men&quot;. By the eve of Hu&#x27;s funeral, the demonstration had reached 100,000 people on Tiananmen Square. While the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership, participants raised the issue of corruption within the government and some voiced calls for economic liberalization and democratic reform within the structure of the government while others called for a less authoritarian and less centralized form of socialism.

During the demonstrations, Deng&#x27;s pro-market ally General Secretary Zhao Ziyang supported the demonstrators and distanced himself from the Politburo. Martial law was declared on 20 May by the socialist hardliner, Chinese premier Li Peng, but the initial military advance on the city was blocked by residents. The movement lasted seven weeks. On 3–4 June, over two hundred thousand soldiers in tanks and helicopters were sent into the city to quell the protests by force, resulting in hundreds to thousands of casualties. Many ordinary people in Beijing believed that Deng had ordered the intervention, but political analysts do not know who was actually behind the order. However, Deng&#x27;s daughter defends the actions that occurred as a collective decision by the party leadership.

To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators, the Communist Party initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long program similar to the Anti-Rightist Movement. Old-timers like Deng Fei aimed to deal &quot;strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization&quot;, and more than 30,000 communist officers were deployed to the task.

Zhao was placed under house arrest by hardliners and Deng himself was forced to make concessions to them. He soon declared that &quot;the entire imperialist Western world plans to make all socialist countries discard the socialist road and then bring them under the monopoly of international capital and onto the capitalist road&quot;. A few months later he said that the &quot;United States was too deeply involved&quot; in the student movement, referring to foreign reporters who had given financial aid to the student leaders and later helped them escape to various Western countries, primarily the United States through Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Although Deng initially made concessions to the socialist hardliners, he soon resumed his reforms after his 1992 southern tour. After his tour, he was able to stop the attacks of the socialist hardliners on the reforms through their &quot;named capitalist or socialist?&quot; campaign. Deng privately told former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau that factions of the Communist Party could have grabbed army units and the country had risked a civil war. Two years later, Deng endorsed Zhu Rongji, a Shanghai Mayor, as a vice-premier candidate. Zhu Rongji had refused to declare martial law in Shanghai during the demonstrations even though socialist hardliners had pressured him.

== Resignation and 1992 southern tour ==
Officially, Deng decided to retire from top positions when he stepped down as Chairman of the Central Military Commission in November 1989 and his successor Jiang Zemin became the new Chairman of the Central Military Commission and paramount leader. China, however, was still in the &quot;era of Deng Xiaoping&quot;. He continued to be widely regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the country, believed to have backroom control despite no official position apart from being chairman of the Chinese Contract Bridge Association, and appointed Hu Jintao as Jiang&#x27;s successor at the 14th Party Congress in 1992. Deng was recognized officially as &quot;the chief architect of China&#x27;s economic reforms and China&#x27;s socialist modernization&quot;. To the Communist Party, he was believed to have set a good example for communist cadres who refused to retire at old age. He broke earlier conventions of holding offices for life. He was often referred to as simply &quot;Comrade Xiaoping&quot;, with no title attached.

Because of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Deng&#x27;s power had been significantly weakened and there was a growing formalist faction opposed to Deng&#x27;s reforms within the Communist Party. To reassert his economic agenda, in the spring of 1992, Deng made a tour of southern China, visiting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and spending the New Year in Shanghai, using his travels as a method of reasserting his economic policy after his retirement from office. He said &quot;Some people slander our socialist system as the Qin system, which is vexatious! Our system is not totalitarian, but democratic centralism. During the period of Chairman Mao, it was not the Qin system, but also democratic centralism. I would say that it is more like the system of France.&quot; The 1992 Southern Tour is widely regarded as a critical point in the modern history of China, as it saved the Chinese economic reform and preserved the stability of the society. 

Deng&#x27;s health deteriorated drastically after 1994. In January 1995, Deng&#x27;s daughter told the press that &quot;A year ago, he could walk for 30 minutes twice a day, but now he cannot walk … He needs two people to support him.&quot; It was also reported that Parkinson&#x27;s experts were sent to Beijing to help him in 1995. Deng generally preferred not to directly speak of dying, instead describing himself as &quot;going to see the Premier&quot;, meaning Zhou Enlai.

== Death ==
Deng died on 19 February 1997 at 9:08 p.m. Beijing time, aged 92 from a lung infection and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The public was largely prepared for his death, as there had been rumors that his health was deteriorating. At 10:00 on the morning of 24 February, people were asked by Premier Li Peng to pause in silence for three minutes. The nation&#x27;s flags flew at half-mast for over a week. 

Deng&#x27;s official obituary instructed Chinese people to study Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s method of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It praised his &quot;scientific attitude and creative spirit in applying a Marxist stand&quot; and his &quot;viewpoints and methods to studying new problems and solving new problems&quot;. It also praised his 1992 southern tour.

The nationally televised funeral, which was a simple and relatively private affair attended by the country&#x27;s leaders and Deng&#x27;s family, was broadcast on all cable channels. After the funeral, his organs were donated to medical research. The remains were cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery and his ashes were subsequently scattered at sea from an airplane by his wife, Zhuo Lin. For the next two weeks, Chinese state media ran news stories and documentaries related to Deng&#x27;s life and death, with the regular 19:00 &quot;National News&quot; program in the evening lasting almost two hours over the regular broadcast time.

Deng&#x27;s successor, Jiang Zemin, maintained Deng&#x27;s political and economic philosophies. Deng was eulogized as a &quot;great Marxist, great Proletarian Revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat; one of the main leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China; the great architect of China&#x27;s socialist opening-up and modernized construction; the founder of Deng Xiaoping Theory&quot;. Some elements, notably modern Maoists and radical reformers (the far left and the far right), had negative views, however. 

Deng&#x27;s death drew international reaction. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Deng was to be remembered &quot;in the international community at large as a primary architect of China&#x27;s modernization and dramatic economic development&quot;. French President Jacques Chirac said &quot;In the course of this century, few men have, as much as Deng, led a vast human community through such profound and determining changes&quot;; British Prime Minister John Major commented about Deng&#x27;s key role in the return of Hong Kong to Chinese control; Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien called Deng a &quot;pivotal figure&quot; in Chinese history. The Kuomintang chair in Taiwan also sent its condolences, saying it longed for peace, cooperation, and prosperity. The Dalai Lama voiced regret that Deng died without resolving questions over Tibet.

The song Story of Spring, by Dong Wenhua, celebrates Deng&#x27;s achievements. It was first performed during a television gala in 1994.

== Legacy ==
Deng&#x27;s view that &quot;development is the absolute principle&quot; continues to shape the Chinese approach to governance. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, Jiang Zemin and the third generation of leaders stated, &quot;Development is the Party&#x27;s top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country.&quot; Likewise, Deng&#x27;s emphasis on development as the absolute principle also shaped Hu Jintao&#x27;s Scientific Outlook on Development and Xi Jinping&#x27;s Chinese Dream, which emphasizes development as China&#x27;s core task.

===Memorials===

Memorials to Deng have been low profile compared to other leaders, in keeping with Deng&#x27;s image of pragmatism. Rather than being embalmed, as was Mao, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. There are some public displays, however. A bronze statue was erected on 14 November 2000, at the grand plaza of Lianhua Mountain Park in Shenzhen. This statue is dedicated to Deng&#x27;s role as a planner and contributor to the development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. The statue is high, with an additional 3.68-meter base, and shows Deng striding forward confidently. Many CCP high level leaders visit the statue. In addition, in coastal areas and on the island province of Hainan, Deng appeared on roadside billboards with messages emphasizing economic reform or his policy of one country, two systems.

A bronze statue to commemorate Deng&#x27;s 100th birthday was dedicated 13 August 2004 in the city of Guang&#x27;an, Deng&#x27;s hometown, in southwest China&#x27;s Sichuan. Deng is dressed casually, sitting on a chair and smiling. The Chinese characters on the pedestal were written by Jiang Zemin, then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Former Residence in his hometown of Paifang Village in Sichuan has been preserved as an historical museum.

In Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, there is a six-lane boulevard, wide and long, the Deng Xiaoping Prospekt, which was dedicated on 18 June 1997. A two-meter high red granite monument stands at the east end of this route. The epigraph is written in Chinese, Russian and Kirghiz.

The documentary, &quot;Deng Xiaoping&quot;, released by CCTV in January 1997, presents his life from his days as a student in France to his &quot;Southern Tour&quot; of 1993. In 2014, CCTV released a TV series, &quot;Deng Xiaoping at History&#x27;s Crossroads&quot;, in anticipation of the 110th anniversary of his birth.

=== Assessment ===
Deng has been called the &quot;architect of contemporary China&quot; and is widely considered to have been one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. He was the &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year in 1978 and 1985, the third Chinese leader (after Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling) and the fourth time for a communist leader (after Joseph Stalin, picked twice; and Nikita Khrushchev) to be selected.

Deng is remembered primarily for the economic reforms he initiated while paramount leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which pivoted China towards a market economy, led to high economic growth, increased standards of living of hundreds of millions, expanded personal and cultural freedoms, and substantially integrated the country into the world economy. More people were lifted out of poverty during his leadership than during any other time in human history, attributed largely to his reforms. For this reason, some have suggested that Deng should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Deng is also credited with reducing the cult of Mao Zedong and with bringing an end to the chaotic era of the Cultural Revolution. Furthermore, his strong-handed tactics have been credited with keeping the People&#x27;s Republic of China unified, in contrast to the other major Communist power of the time, the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991.

However, Deng is also remembered for human rights violations and for numerous instances of political violence. As paramount leader, he oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre; afterwards, he was influential in the Communist Party&#x27;s domestic cover-up of the event. Furthermore, he is associated with some of the worst purges during Mao Zedong&#x27;s rule; for instance, he ordered an army crackdown on a Muslim village in Yunnan which resulted in the deaths of 1,600 people, including 300 children.

As paramount leader, Deng also negotiated an end to the British colonial rule of Hong Kong and normalized relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. In August 1980, he started China&#x27;s political reforms by setting term limits for officials and proposing a systematic revision of China&#x27;s third Constitution which was made during the Cultural Revolution; the new Constitution embodied Chinese-style constitutionalism and was passed by the National People&#x27;s Congress in December 1982, with most of its content still being effective as of today. He helped establish China&#x27;s nine-year compulsory education, and revived China&#x27;s political reforms.

<text>HM Prison Dartmoor is a currently inactive Category C men&#x27;s prison, located in Princetown, high on Dartmoor in the English county of Devon. Its high granite walls dominate this area of the moor. The prison is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, and is operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service.

As of Summer 2024, Dartmoor Prison is not being used due to safety concerns, regarding high levels of radon.

Dartmoor Prison was given Grade II heritage listing in 1987.

==History==
===POW prison===
In 1805, the United Kingdom was at war with Napoleonic France, a conflict during which thousands of prisoners were taken and confined in prison &quot;hulks&quot; or derelict ships. This was considered a security risk, partially due to the proximity of the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport (then called Plymouth Dock) and living conditions were appalling in the extreme; consequently, a prisoner of war depot was planned in the remote isolation of Dartmoor.

The prison was designed by Daniel Asher Alexander. Construction by local labour started in 1806, taking three years to complete. In 1809, the first French prisoners arrived and the prison was full by the end of the year.

From the spring of 1813 until March 1815, about 6,500 American sailors from the War of 1812 were imprisoned at Dartmoor in poor conditions (food was bad and the roofs leaked). These were either naval prisoners or impressed American seamen discharged from British vessels. Whilst the British were in overall charge of the prison, the prisoners created their own governance and culture. They had courts which meted out punishments, a market, a theatre and a gambling room. About 1,000 of the prisoners were Black. A recent examination of the General Entry Book of American Prisoners of War at Dartmoor, by Nicholas Guyatt, found &quot;Eight Hundred and Twenty - Nine Sailors of Colour had been entered into the register by the end of October 1814.&quot;

===Escapes===
Unlike many detention facilities of the period, Dartmoor Prison was purpose built in an isolated location, ringed by high stone walls, and manned by hundreds of armed militia sentries. In addition a rope ran around the entire circumference of the prison, linked to a series of bells, which quickly spread an alarm. Even if a determined prisoner made it beyond the walls, he would still have to traverse ten miles on foot, over wild moorland and bogs, an area frequently beset with fog and chilling winds, to reach the nearest town. Local residents turning in an escapee could expect a reward of a guinea. Yet, despite these daunting odds, scholar Nicholas Guyatt has tallied a total of twenty-four American POWs successfully making their way to freedom.

;Disorder
Although the war ended with the Treaty of Ghent on 24 December 1814, American prisoners of war remained in Dartmoor because the British government refused to let them go on parole or take any steps until the treaty was ratified by the United States Senate on 17 February 1815. It took several weeks for the American agent to secure ships for their transportation home, and the men grew very impatient. On 4 April, a food contractor attempted to work off some damaged hardtack on them in place of soft bread and was forced to yield by their insurrection. The commandant, Captain T. G. Shortland, suspected them of a design to break out of the gaol. This was the reverse of the truth in general, as they would lose their chance of going on the ships, but a few had made threats of the sort, and the commandant was very uneasy.

At about 6:00 pm on 6 April, Shortland discovered a hole from one of the five prisons to the barrack yard near the gun racks. Some prisoners were outside the fence, noisily pelting each other with turf, and many more were near the breach (and the gambling tables), though the signal for return to prisons had sounded. Shortland was convinced of a plot and rang the alarm bell to collect the officers and have the guards ready. This precaution brought back a crowd just going to quarters. Just then a prisoner broke a gate chain with an iron bar and a number of the prisoners pressed through to the prison market square. After attempts at persuasion, Shortland ordered a charge which drove some of the prisoners in. Those near the gate, however, hooted at and taunted the soldiery, who fired a volley over their heads. The crowd yelled louder and threw stones, and the soldiers, probably without orders fired a direct volley which killed and wounded a large number. Then they continued firing at the prisoners, many of whom were now struggling to get back inside the blocks.

Finally the captain, a lieutenant and the hospital surgeon (the other officers being at dinner) succeeded in stopping the shooting and started caring for the wounded – about 60, 30 seriously, besides seven killed outright. The affair was examined by a joint commission, Charles King for the United States and F. S. Larpent for Great Britain, which exonerated Shortland, justified the initial shooting and blamed the subsequent deaths on unknown culprits. Following these findings, Shortland was rewarded with a promotion. Despite being labelled &quot;The Dartmoor Massacre&quot;, the British government paid compensation to the American families of those killed and pensioned the disabled.

A memorial has been erected to the 271 POWs (mostly seamen) who are buried in the prison grounds. By July 1815 at least 270 Americans and 1,200 French prisoners had died.

===Closure and reopening ===

After all American and French prisoners had been released, paroled and repatriated, the gaol on Dartmoor was left unused for 35 years until 1850. Work then began to rebuild and recommission the prison for civilian convicts. It reopened in 1851. The POW remains that had been originally buried on the moor were exhumed and re-interred in two cemeteries behind the prison when the prison farm was established in about 1852.
During the First World War in 1917, criminals were removed from the gaol when it was converted into a Home Office Work Centre for conscientious objectors granted release from other prisons. The cells were left unlocked, inmates wore their own clothes and could go outside to visit the village in their off-duty time.

===Notoriety===
In 1920, the prison began housing UK criminals. It would develop a reputation for housing some of Britain&#x27;s most serious offenders that included murderers, gangsters, thieves, spies, and robbers such as Jack “the Hat” McVitie, Jack “Spot” Comer, John George Haigh, and Frank Mitchell. Numerous escape attempts have been made by inmates to get out of the prison and onto the moors, leading to massive manhunts by the police and prison service. Instances of disobedience included a model prisoner attacking a popular guard with a razor blade and rough treatment by prisoners of a prisoner being removed to solitary.

;Mutiny
The prison&#x27;s tough conditions eventually led to its worst outbreak of violence on 24 January 1932. The cause of the riots is generally attributed to prisoners&#x27; perceptions of poor quality of the food, not generally but on specific days prior to the disturbance when it was suspected it had been tampered with. At the parade later that day, 50 prisoners refused orders, and the rest were marched back to their cells but refused to enter. At this point, the prison governor and his staff fled to an unused part of the prison and secured themselves there. The prisoners then released those held in solitary. There was extensive damage to property, and a prisoner was shot by one of the staff, but no prison staff were injured. According to the du Parcq report into the riot: &quot;Reinforcements arrived, and within fifteen minutes these &#x27;vicious brutes&#x27;, who for some two hours had terrorized well-armed prison staff, and effectively controlled the prison, had surrendered and been locked up again&quot;.

==Modern operations==

Dartmoor continues to suffer from its age, in 2001 a Board of Visitors report condemned sanitation, as well as highlighting a list of urgent repairs needed. A year later, the prison was converted to a Category C prison for less violent offenders. In 2002, the Prison Reform Trust warned that the prison may be breaching the Human Rights Act 1998 due to severe overcrowding at the jail. A year later, however, the Chief Inspector of Prisons declared that the prison had made substantial improvements to its management and regime.

In March 2008, staff at the prison passed a vote of no confidence in the governor Serena Watts, claiming they felt bullied by managers and unsafe.

Dartmoor is now a Category C prison, which means it houses mainly non-violent offenders and white-collar criminals. It also holds people with convictions for sexual offences, but it is designated as a support site only for these individuals and as such does not offer treatment programmes for them.

Dartmoor operates cell accommodation on six wings. Education is available at the prison (full and part-time), and ranges from basic educational skills to Open University courses. Vocational training includes electronics, brickwork and carpentry courses up to City &amp; Guilds and NVQ level, Painting and Decorating courses, industrial cleaning and desktop publishing. Full-time employment is also available in catering, farming, gardening, laundry, textiles, Braille, contract services, furniture manufacturing and polishing. Employment is supported with NVQ or City &amp; Guilds vocational qualifications. All courses and qualifications at Dartmoor are operated by South Gloucestershire and Stroud College and Cornwall College.

The &quot;Dartmoor Jailbreak&quot; is a yearly event, in which members of the public &quot;escape&quot; from the prison and must travel as far as possible in four days, without directly paying for transport. By doing so they raise money for charity.

In September 2013, it was announced that discussions would commence with the Duchy of Cornwall about the long-term future of HMP Dartmoor. In January 2014 it was stated on the BBC news website that the notice period with the Duchy for closing is 10 years. In November 2015 the Ministry of Justice confirmed that, as part of a major programme to replace older prisons, it would not renew its lease on the prison.

It was announced in October 2019 that HMP Dartmoor would close in 2023, but in December 2021 it was confirmed that, following negotiations with the Duchy, it would remain open beyond 2023 and for the foreseeable future.

In 2023, 96 inmates of the prison had to be evacuated due to the presence of radon gas, caused by the decay of uranium in the prison bedrock and walls. No adverse health effects related to radon poisoning have been recorded at the prison.

In 2024, hundreds of prisoners were transferred to other prisons due to the presence of unsafe levels of radon gas throughout the prison and in cells. In total 682 prisoners were required to be moved. By the summer of 2024, any remaining prisoners were ordered to be transferred out and the prison closed. However, it is unclear when or even if the prison will ever be operational again.

==Dartmoor Prison Museum==
The Dartmoor Prison Museum, located in the old dairy buildings, focuses on the history of HMP Dartmoor. Exhibits include the prison&#x27;s role in housing prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, manacles and weapons, memorabilia, clothing and uniforms, famous prisoners, and the changed focus of the prison. It also sells (2015) garden ornaments and other items made in the prison concrete and carpentry shops by prisoners engaged in educational courses.

There are also displays and information on less well known aspects of the prison such as the incarceration of conscientious objectors during World War One.

<doc id="8207" wikidata="Q6862502" url="?curid=8207" title="Dilation and curettage">
<text>Dilation (or dilatation) and curettage (D&amp;C) refers to the dilation (widening or opening) of the cervix and surgical removal of sections and/or layers of the lining of the uterus and or contents of the uterus such as an unwanted fetus (early abortion before 13 weeks), remains of a non-viable fetus, retained placenta after birth or abortion as well as any abnormal tissue which may be in the uterus causing abnormal cycles by scraping and scooping (curettage). It is a gynecologic procedure used for treatment and removal as well as diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and is the most commonly used method for first trimester abortion or miscarriage.

D&amp;C normally refers to a procedure involving a curette, also called &quot;sharp curettage&quot;. However, some sources use the term &quot;D&amp;C&quot; to refer to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents which includes the more common &quot;suction curettage&quot; procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration.

==Clinical uses==
D&amp;Cs may be performed in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, for different clinical indications. Such examples are for Early Abortion, Removing the remains of a non-viable pregnancy or retention of placenta from a pregnancy loss/abortion. Treatment of menopause induced anomalies with menstrual cycle.

=== During pregnancy or postpartum ===
A D&amp;C may be performed early in pregnancy to remove pregnancy tissue, either in the case of a non-viable pregnancy, such as a missed or incomplete miscarriage, or an undesired pregnancy, as in a surgical abortion. Medical management of miscarriage and medical abortion using drugs such as misoprostol and mifepristone are safe, non-invasive and potentially less expensive alternatives to D&amp;C.

Because medication-based non-invasive methods of abortion now exist, dilation and curettage has been declining as a method of abortion, although suction curettage is still the most common and preferred method to ensure complete removal of remains as the method is a completed process used for termination of a First-Trimester Pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends D&amp;C with a Sharp Curette as a method of surgical abortion ONLY when manual vacuum aspiration with a suction curette is unavailable.

For patients who have recently given birth, a D&amp;C may be indicated to remove retained placental tissue that does not pass spontaneously or for postpartum hemorrhage.

=== Non-pregnant patients ===

D&amp;Cs for non-pregnant patients are commonly performed in tandem with Hysteroscopy another diagnostic procedure, for the diagnosis of gynecological conditions usually involving abnormal bleeding; during menopause or with various abnormal structures growing within the uterus to remove the excess uterine lining in women who have conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome; to remove tissue in the uterus that may be causing abnormal uterine bleeding, such as endometrial polyps or uterine fibroids; or to diagnose the cause of post-menopausal bleeding, such as in the case of endometrial cancer.

Hysteroscopy is a valid alternative or addition to D&amp;C for many surgical indications, from diagnosis of uterine pathology to the removal of fibroids and even retained tissue of Pregnancy . It allows direct visualization of the inside of the uterus and may allow targeted sampling and removal of tissue inside the uterus.

==Procedure==
 Depending on the anticipated duration and difficulty expected with the procedure, as well as the clinical indication and patient preferences, a D&amp;C may be performed with local anesthesia, moderate sedation, deep sedation, or general anesthesia. The first step in a D&amp;C is to place a speculum in the vagina so as to see the cervix. Often, a tenaculum is placed to steady the cervix. Next, the provider will dilate the cervix. This can be done with Hegar or similar dilators. The amount of dilation depends on the amount of tissue to be removed as well as the size of the instruments to be used. After sufficient dilation, a curette, a metal rod with a handle on one end and a loop on the other, is then inserted into the uterus through the dilated cervix. The curette is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus and remove the tissue in the uterus. If a suction curette is used, as in a vacuum aspiration, a plastic tubular curette will be introduced into the uterus and connected to suction to remove all tissue in the uterus. This tissue is examined for completeness (in the case of abortion or miscarriage treatment) or by pathology for abnormalities (in the case of treatment for abnormal bleeding).

==Complications==
The most common complications associated with D&amp;C are infection, bleeding, or damage to nearby organs, including through uterine perforation. Aside from the surgery itself, complications related to anesthesia administration may also occur.

Infection is uncommon after D&amp;C for a non-pregnant patient, and society practice guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic antibiotics to patients. However, for curettage of a pregnant patient, the risk of infection is higher, and patients should receive antibiotics that cover the bacteria commonly found in the vagina and gastrointestinal tract; doxycycline is a common recommendation, though azithromycin may also be used.

Another risk of D&amp;C is uterine perforation. The highest rate of uterine perforation appears to be in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (5.1%) compared with a lower rate in diagnostic curettage in non-pregnant patients (0.3% in the premenopausal patient and 2.6% in the postmenopausal patient). Perforation may cause excessive bleeding or damage to organs outside the uterus. If the provider is concerned about ongoing bleeding or the possibility of injury to organs outside the uterus, a laparoscopy may be done to verify that there has been no undiagnosed injury.

Another potential risk is Asherman&#x27;s syndrome, a condition where intrauterine adhesions lead to subfertility, amenorrhea, or recurrent pregnancy loss. Although older studies described a high (25-30%) risk of developing this condition after dilation and curettage for treatment of miscarriage, these procedures were likely done using sharp curettage, which is no longer routinely performed in modern miscarriage and abortion care. Newer studies reflect the common technique of suction curettage and demonstrate a much lower risk of Asherman&#x27;s syndrome, with incidence in large prospective trials ranging from 0.7 to 1.6%. A history of multiple (&gt;3) procedures and sharp curettage were identified as risk factors for developing clinical Asherman&#x27;s syndrome. A systematic review in 2013 concluded that recurrent miscarriage treated with D&amp;C is the main risk factors for intrauterine adhesions. There are currently no studies linking asymptomatic intrauterine adhesions and long-term reproductive outcomes, and similar pregnancy outcomes have been found after miscarriage regardless of whether surgical treatment, medication management, or conservative management (i.e. watchful waiting) was chosen.

<doc id="8209" wikidata="Q34316" url="?curid=8209" title="Doctor Who">
<text>Doctor Who is a British science fiction television series broadcast by the BBC since 1963. The series, created by Sydney Newman, C. E. Webber and Donald Wilson, depicts the adventures of an extraterrestrial being called the Doctor, part of a humanoid species called Time Lords. The Doctor travels in the universe and in time using a time travelling spaceship called the TARDIS, which externally appears as a British police box. While travelling, the Doctor works to save lives and liberate oppressed peoples by combating foes. The Doctor often travels with companions.

Beginning with William Hartnell, fourteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor; , Ncuti Gatwa leads the series as the Fifteenth Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the series with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation, a plot device in which, when a Time Lord is fatally injured, their cells regenerate and they are reincarnated, into a different body with mannerisms and behaviour, but the same memories, explaining each actor&#x27;s distinct portrayal, as they all represent different stages in the life of the Doctor and, together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor can also change ethnicity or gender; in 2017, Jodie Whittaker became the first woman cast in the lead role, and in 2024, Gatwa became the first black actor to headline the series.

The series is a significant part of popular culture in Britain and elsewhere; it has gained a cult following. It has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. Fans of the series are sometimes referred to as &quot;Whovians&quot;. The series has been listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running science-fiction television series in the world, as well as the &quot;most successful&quot; science-fiction series of all time, based on its overall broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales.

The series originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film titled &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The series was relaunched in 2005 and was produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. Since 2023, the show has been co-produced by Bad Wolf and BBC Studios Productions in Cardiff. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has spawned numerous spin-offs as part of the Whoniverse, including comic books, films, novels and audio dramas, and the television series &quot;Torchwood&quot; (2006–2011), &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007–2011), &quot;K9&quot; (2009–2010), &quot;Class&quot; (2016), &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; (2023–2024), and the upcoming &quot;The War Between the Land and the Sea&quot;. It has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.

==Premise==
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord with somewhat unknown origins who goes by the name &quot;the Doctor&quot;. The Doctor fled Gallifrey, the planet of the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS (&quot;Time and Relative Dimension(s) in Space&quot;), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and dematerialising out of, the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a &quot;chameleon circuit&quot; intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. Because of a malfunction, the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box.

Across time and space, the Doctor&#x27;s many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity, and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile sonic screwdriver. The Doctor rarely travels alone and is often joined by one or more companions on these adventures; these companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor&#x27;s fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force UNIT when Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate when there is mortal damage to their body. The Doctor&#x27;s various incarnations have gained numerous recurring enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, their creator Davros, the Cybermen, and the renegade Time Lord the Master.

==History==

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; was originally intended to appeal to a family audience as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. The programme first appeared on the BBC Television Service at 17:16:20 GMT on 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, because of announcements concerning the previous day&#x27;s assassination of John F. Kennedy. It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber; in a 1971 interview Wilson claimed to have named the series, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.

On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title &quot;The Mutants&quot;. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Wilson, it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot;. According to Lambert, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a lot of choice—we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn&#x27;t make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.&quot; Nation&#x27;s script became the second &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial – &quot;The Daleks&quot; (also known as &quot;The Mutants&quot;). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series&#x27; most popular monsters, dubbed &quot;Dalekmania&quot;, and was responsible for the BBC&#x27;s first merchandising boom.

The BBC drama department produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC One. Due to his increasingly poor health, William Hartnell, first actor to play the Doctor, was succeeded by Patrick Troughton in 1966. In 1970, Jon Pertwee replaced Troughton and the series began production in colour. In 1974, Tom Baker was cast as the Doctor. His eccentric personality became hugely popular, with viewing figures for the series returning to a level not seen since the height of &quot;Dalekmania&quot; a decade earlier. After seven years in the role, Baker was replaced by Peter Davison in 1981, and Colin Baker replaced Davison in 1984. In 1985, the channel&#x27;s controller Michael Grade cancelled the upcoming twenty-third season, forcing the series into an eighteen-month hiatus. In 1986, the series was recommissioned on the condition that Baker left the role of the Doctor, which was recast to Sylvester McCoy in 1987. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the series and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production ended in 1989 by Peter Cregeen, the BBC&#x27;s new head of series. Although it was effectively cancelled, the BBC repeatedly affirmed over several years that the series would return.

While in-house production concluded, the BBC explored an independent production company to relaunch the series. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures&#x27; television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production. Segal&#x27;s negotiations eventually led to a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film as a pilot for an American series, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996, as an international co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Starring Paul McGann as the Doctor, the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), but was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.

Licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; remained dormant. In September 2003, BBC Television announced the in-house production of a new series, after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The 2005 revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series and the 1996 television film. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; writer Russell T Davies and BBC Cymru Wales head of drama Julie Gardner. From 2005, the series switched from a multi-camera to a single-camera setup.
Starring Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned with the episode &quot;Rose&quot; on BBC One on 26 March 2005, after a 16-year hiatus of in-house production. Eccleston left after one series and was replaced by David Tennant. Davies left the production team in 2009. Steven Moffat, a writer under Davies, was announced as his successor, along with Matt Smith as the new Doctor. Smith decided to leave the role of the Doctor in 2013, the 50th anniversary year. He was replaced by Peter Capaldi.

In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018. Jodie Whittaker, the first female Doctor, appeared in three series, the last of which was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both Whittaker and Chibnall announced that they would depart the series after a series of specials in 2022. Davies returned as showrunner from the 60th anniversary specials, twelve years after he had left the series previously. Bad Wolf co-produces the series in partnership with BBC Studios Productions. Bad Wolf&#x27;s involvement sees Gardner return to the series alongside Davies and Jane Tranter, who recommissioned the series in 2005.

The programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide .

===Public consciousness===
It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; in fact, it went out after a delay of eighty seconds. The BBC believed that coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, had caused many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, and it was broadcast again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two.

The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience. The show received controversy over the suitability of the series for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC over what she saw as the programme&#x27;s violent, frightening and gory content. According to &quot;Radio Times&quot;, the series &quot;never had a more implacable foe than Mary Whitehouse&quot;.

A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence (&quot;any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental&quot;), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience believed the series was &quot;very unsuitable&quot; for family viewing. Responding to the findings of the survey in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, &quot;to compare the violence of &quot;Dr Who&quot;, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.&quot;

During Jon Pertwee&#x27;s second season as the Doctor, in the serial &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the series&#x27; ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot; and the Doctor apparently being drowned by a villain in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (both 1976). Mary Whitehouse&#x27;s complaint about the latter incident prompted a change in BBC policy towards the series, with much tighter controls imposed on the production team, and the series&#x27; next producer, Graham Williams, was under a directive to take out &quot;anything graphic in the depiction of violence&quot;. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and said in the documentary &quot;More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS&quot; that he looked forward to Whitehouse&#x27;s comments because the ratings of the series would increase soon after she had made them. Nathan-Turner also got into trouble with BBC executives over the violence he allowed to be depicted for season 22 of the series in 1985, which was publicly criticised by controller Michael Grade and given as one of his reasons for suspending the series for 18 months.

The phrase &quot;hiding &quot; (or &quot;watching from behind the sofa&quot;) entered British pop culture, signifying the stereotypical but apocryphal early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it. &quot;The Economist&quot; presented &quot;hiding behind the sofa whenever the Daleks appear&quot; as a British cultural institution on a par with Bovril and tea-time. Paul Parsons, author of &quot;The Science of Doctor Who&quot;, explains the appeal of hiding behind the sofa as the activation of the fear response in the amygdala in conjunction with reassurances of safety from the brain&#x27;s frontal lobe. The phrase retains this association with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named its exhibition celebrating the programme &quot;Behind the Sofa&quot;. The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill &quot;at the center of many people&#x27;s relationship with the series&quot;, and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the &quot;scariest TV show of all time&quot;.

The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the series in the public&#x27;s consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the TARDIS&#x27; blue police box design in merchandising associated with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trademark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.

The 21st-century revival of the programme became the centrepiece of BBC One&#x27;s Saturday schedule and &quot;defined the channel&quot;. Many renowned actors have made guest-starring appearances in various stories including Kylie Minogue, Sir Ian McKellen, and Andrew Garfield among others. According to an article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2009, the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index. In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is &quot;quintessential to being British&quot;. According to Steven Moffat, the American film director Steven Spielberg has commented that &quot;the world would be a poorer place without &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;.

On 4 August 2013, a live programme titled &quot;Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor&quot; was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor who was going to play the Twelfth Doctor was revealed. The live show was watched by an average of 6.27 million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia.

==Episodes==

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or &quot;serial&quot;)—usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;, featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial &quot;The War Games&quot;; and &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;, which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. Occasionally, serials were loosely connected by a story line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16&#x27;s quest for the Key to Time, season 18&#x27;s journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20&#x27;s Black Guardian trilogy.

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor&#x27;s original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-oriented episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after &quot;The Highlanders&quot; (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: &quot;Black Orchid&quot; (1982), set in 1920s England.

The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were assigned episode numbers.

Of the programme&#x27;s many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the best known outside &quot;Doctor Who&quot; itself, due to the popularity of his &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; works.

The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with what was now called a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels) and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival&#x27;s eighth series, and ten episodes from the eleventh series. Each series includes standalone and multiple episodic stories, often linked with a loose story arc resolved in the series finale. As in the early &quot;classic&quot; era, each episode has its own title, whether stand-alone or part of a larger story. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; from 2008 and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; from 2010 were longer than an hour.

 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format for the classic era), 45/50-minute episodes (for &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the most common format for the revival era since 2005), two feature-length productions (1983&#x27;s &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; and the 1996 television film), twelve Christmas specials (most of approximately 60 minutes&#x27; duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010, and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005, and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;–themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 two-part story, entitled &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and was filmed partly on the &quot;EastEnders&quot; set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot;, the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, was broadcast in 2013. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.

In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.

===Missing episodes===

Between 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC&#x27;s various video tape and film libraries was either destroyed or wiped. This included many early episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, those stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the programme&#x27;s first six years are not held in the BBC&#x27;s archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, and 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying &quot;spare&quot; film copies had been brought to a stop.

No 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission and exist in their broadcast form.

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries that bought prints for broadcast or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1964), &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Massacre&quot; (1966) also exist.

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer John Cura, who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. The BBC has tolerated these amateur reconstructions, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality copies.

One of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; (1966), which ends with the First Doctor transforming into the Second. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now underway to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.

&quot;Official&quot; reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial&#x27;s DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of &quot;The Reign of Terror&quot; were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with Big Finish, and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com. Subsequent animations made in 2013 include &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Moonbase&quot; (1967).

In April 2006, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; launched a challenge to find missing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes with the promise of a full-scale Dalek model as a reward. In December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of &quot;Galaxy 4&quot; (1965) and part 2 of &quot;The Underwater Menace&quot; (1967) had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them.

On 10 October 2013, the BBC announced that films of eleven episodes, including nine missing episodes, had been found in a Nigerian television relay station in Jos. Six of the eleven films discovered were the six-part serial &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1968), from which all but the third episode had been missing. The remaining films were from another six-part serial, &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968), and included the previously missing episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6. Episode 3 of &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; is still missing.

==Characters==
===The Doctor===

The Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. In the programme&#x27;s early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the &quot;TARDIS&quot; (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside.

The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and was eventually revealed to be a Time Lord, whose race are from the planet Gallifrey, which the Doctor fled by stealing the TARDIS.

====Changes of appearance====
Producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell. The term &quot;regeneration&quot; was not conceived until the Doctor&#x27;s third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell&#x27;s Doctor merely described undergoing a &quot;renewal&quot;, and the Second Doctor underwent a &quot;change of appearance&quot;. The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show&#x27;s history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor&#x27;s relative past or future.

The serials &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976) and &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013) depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor&#x27;s twelfth regeneration from his original set.

Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show&#x27;s writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men. Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special and is the first woman to be cast as the character. The show introduced the Time Lords&#x27; ability to change sex on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez&#x27;s version of the Master and T&#x27;Nia Miller&#x27;s version of the General.

Upon Whittaker&#x27;s final appearance as the character in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; on 23 October 2022, she regenerated into a form portrayed by David Tennant, who was confirmed to be the Fourteenth Doctor and the first actor to play two incarnations, having previously played the Tenth Doctor. In the same year, Ncuti Gatwa was revealed to be portraying the Fifteenth Doctor, making him the first black actor to headline the series.

In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show&#x27;s 50th-anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. He is shown in mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; retroactively inserted into the show&#x27;s fictional chronology between McGann&#x27;s and Eccleston&#x27;s Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. The show later introduced another such unknown past Doctor with Jo Martin&#x27;s recurring portrayal of the Fugitive Doctor, beginning with &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot; (2020). An example from the classic series comes from &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; (1986), in which Michael Jayston&#x27;s character the Valeyard is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor&#x27;s nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation. The most recent example is when Richard E. Grant, who previously portrayed an alternate version of the Doctor known as the Shalka Doctor in the animated series Scream of the Shalka (2003), appeared as a hologram of a past Doctor in &quot;Rogue&quot; (2024).

On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell&#x27;s death in 1975; 34 years later David Bradley similarly replaced Hartnell in &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;. In &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films.

The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor&#x27;s sex (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of Jo Martin in &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).

====Meetings of different incarnations====
There have been instances of actors returning later to reprise their specific Doctor&#x27;s role. In 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted &quot;Shada&quot; serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; with Colin Baker.

In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short &quot;Time Crash&quot; alongside David Tennant. In &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. In the following episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, David Tennant&#x27;s Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage of all the previous actors. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by David Bradley) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in &quot;The Doctor Falls&quot; and &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.

In 2020&#x27;s &quot;Fugitive of the Judoon&quot;, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin&#x27;s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor; they interact again in the episode &quot;The Timeless Children&quot; later that year as well as in &quot;Once, Upon Time&quot; in 2021. In her final episode, &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022), Whittaker interacts with the Guardians of the Edge, manifestations of the Doctor&#x27;s First (Bradley), Fifth (Davison), Sixth (Colin Baker), Seventh (McCoy), and Eighth (McGann) incarnations. Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various audio dramas and novels based on the television show.

===Companions===

The companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since the programme&#x27;s inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor&#x27;s &quot;moral duty&quot;. The Doctor&#x27;s first companions seen on-screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor, who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series include a Time Lady named Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), and humans such as Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), Jo Grant (Katy Manning), Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant), and Ace (Sophie Aldred). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes—or loves—on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually humans or humanoid aliens.
Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate), with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs that continued with the Twelfth Doctor. The tenth series included the alien Nardole (Matt Lucas) and introduced Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts, the Doctor&#x27;s first openly gay companion. Pearl Mackie said that the increased representation of LGBTQ people is important on a mainstream show. The Thirteenth Doctor has primarily travelled with Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), Graham O&#x27;Brien (Bradley Walsh), Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), and Dan Lewis (John Bishop).

Some companions have gone on to reappear, either in the main series or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007–2011) following a return to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2006. Guest stars in the series include former companions Jo Grant, K9, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, &quot;Torchwood&quot; (2006–2011), in which Martha Jones also appeared.

===Foes===

When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the &quot;bug-eyed monster&quot; of science fiction. However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; almost from the beginning. Daleks, Cybermen, and the Master are some of the most iconic foes the Doctor has battled in the series.

With the show&#x27;s 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce the classic monsters of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The Autons with the Nestene Consciousness, first seen in 1970&#x27;s Spearhead from Space, and Daleks, first seen in 1963&#x27;s The Daleks, returned in series 1. Davies&#x27;s successor, Steven Moffat, continued the trend by reviving the Silurians, also first seen in 1970, in series 5 and Zygons, first seen in 1975, in the 50th-anniversary special. Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorians), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.

====Daleks====

The Daleks, which first appeared in the show&#x27;s second serial in 1963, are &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s oldest villains. The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to &quot;exterminate&quot; all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring &#x27;monster&#x27; within the Doctor Who franchise, having appeared in every series since 2005. Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, although played by several different actors.

The Daleks were created by the writer Terry Nation (who intended them to be an allegory of the Nazis) and BBC designer Raymond Cusick. The Daleks&#x27; début in the programme&#x27;s second serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963–1964), made both the Daleks and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon. The Daleks received another stamp in 2013 as part of the 50th anniversary. In &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; a new set of Daleks were introduced that come in a range of colours; the colour denoting its role within the species.

==== Cybermen ====
Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth&#x27;s twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring &#x27;monster&#x27; within the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; franchise.

The Cybermen have evolved dramatically over the course of the show. They were reintroduced in the 2006 series in the form of alternate universe aliens, with radically different back stories. The standard Cybermen returned in &quot;Closing Time&quot;, though they kept their 2006 design. In the 2020 series, the Cybermen aligned themselves with The Master, and were given the ability to regenerate.

====The Master====

The Master is the Doctor&#x27;s archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as &quot;Professor Moriarty to the Doctor&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes&quot;, the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts.

Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character&#x27;s reintroduction in the 2007 episode &quot;Utopia&quot;. During that story, the role was then assumed by John Simm, who returned to the role multiple times throughout the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s tenure. In the 2014 episode &quot;Dark Water&quot;, it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or &quot;Time Lady&quot;, going by the name of &quot;Missy&quot; (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of &quot;Master&quot;). This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez. Simm returned to his role as the Master alongside Gomez in the tenth series. The Master returned for the 2020 twelfth series with Sacha Dhawan in the role. This incarnation dubbed himself the &quot;Spy Master&quot; referencing a role he had taken with MI6.

==Music==
===Theme music===
The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–1980). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, &quot;Jeez, Delia, did I write that?&quot; She answered, &quot;Most of it.&quot; Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time. She would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th-anniversary story &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; in 2013.

A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn&#x27;s arrangement for the season-long serial &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; in season 23 (1986). Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s era, which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series&#x27; suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Grainer&#x27;s original theme for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement, which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added in the 2005 Christmas episode &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;. Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series, and was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM&#x27;s Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold&#x27;s 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special &quot;The Snowmen&quot;, and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th-anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; in November 2013.

Versions of the &quot;Doctor Who Theme&quot; have also been released as pop music. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, &quot;Who Is the Doctor&quot;. In 1978, a disco version of the theme in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988, the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot; under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011, the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album &quot;Gallifrey And Beyond&quot;.

On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for series 11 would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola.

===Incidental music===

Most of the innovative incidental music for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The incidental music for the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, was written by Norman Kay. Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose &quot;Doctor Who&quot; credits include &quot;The Daleks&quot;, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; and &quot;The Mutants&quot;. Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon.

The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;. Simpson&#x27;s first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; score was &quot;Planet of Giants&quot; (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with &quot;The Horns of Nimon&quot; (1979). He also made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (as a Music hall conductor).

In 1980 starting with the serial &quot;The Leisure Hive&quot; the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included Roger Limb, Malcolm Clarke and Jonathan Gibbs. The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; series, and Keff McCulloch took over as the series&#x27; main composer until the end of its run, with Dominic Glynn and Mark Ayres also contributing scores.

From the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, all incidental music for the series was composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval, and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold&#x27;s compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;, written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.

Six soundtracks have been released since 2005. The first featured tracks from the first two series, the second and third featured music from the third and fourth series respectively. The fourth was released on 4 October 2010 as a two-disc special edition and contained music from the 2008–2010 specials (&quot;The Next Doctor&quot; to &quot;End of Time Part 2&quot;). The soundtrack for Series 5 was released on 8 November 2010. In February 2011, a soundtrack was released for the 2010 Christmas special &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and in December 2011, the soundtrack for Series 6 was released, both by Silva Screen Records.

In 2013, a 50th-anniversary boxed set of audio CDs was released featuring music and sound effects from Doctor Who&#x27;s 50-year history. The celebration continued in 2016 with the release of Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection Four LP Box Set by New York City-based Spacelab9. The company pressed 1,000 copies of the set on &quot;Metallic Silver&quot; vinyl, dubbed the &quot;Cyberman Edition&quot;.

==Viewership==
===United Kingdom===

Premiering the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was repeated with the second episode the following week. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has always appeared initially on the BBC&#x27;s mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; The programme&#x27;s popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; period (), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.
During the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme&#x27;s 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months.

Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme&#x27;s 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, the most popular show at the time. During Tennant&#x27;s run (the third notable period of high ratings), the show had consistently high viewership, with the Christmas specials regularly attracting over 10 million.

The BBC One broadcast of &quot;Rose&quot;, the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The current revival also garners the highest audience Appreciation Index of any drama on television.

===International===

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been broadcast internationally outside of the United Kingdom since 1964, a year after the show first aired. , the modern series has been broadcast in more than 50 countries. The 50th anniversary episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, was broadcast in 94 countries and screened to more than half a million people in cinemas across Australia, Latin America, North America and Europe. The scope of the broadcast was a world record, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is one of the five top-grossing titles for BBC Worldwide, the BBC&#x27;s commercial arm. BBC Worldwide CEO John Smith has said that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is one of a small number of &quot;Superbrands&quot; which are heavily promoted worldwide.

Only four episodes have premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 20th-anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; had its debut on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days before its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there.

Starting with the 60th-anniversary specials in 2023, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been released on Disney+ outside the United Kingdom and Ireland.

====Oceania====

New Zealand was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new revived series that aired on Prime Television from 2005 to 2017. In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK. The series moved to TVNZ 1 in 2021, before TVNZ lost the rights to the show altogether in 2022.

In Australia, the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) since January 1965. The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the daily screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003 for the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary and the weekly screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The ABC broadcast the modern series&#x27; first run on ABC1 and ABC Me, with repeats on ABC2 and streaming available on ABC iview.

====Americas====
The series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on PBS stations. 

TVOntario picked up the show in 1976 beginning with &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer Judith Merril who introduced the episode and then, after the episode concluded, tried to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO&#x27;s status as an educational channel. Its airing of &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was racist; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV. CBC began showing the series again in 2005. The series moved to the Canadian cable channel Space in 2009.

Series three began broadcasting on CBC on 18 June 2007 followed by the second Christmas special, &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;, at midnight, and the Sci Fi Channel began on 6 July 2007, starting with the second Christmas special at 8:00 pm E/P followed by the first episode.

Series four aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel (now known as Syfy), beginning in April 2008. It aired on CBC beginning 19 September 2008, although the CBC did not air the &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; special. The Canadian cable network Space (now known as CTV Sci-Fi Channel) broadcast &quot;The Next Doctor&quot; (in March 2009) and all subsequent series and specials.

The series was aired in Brazil at the TV networks Syfy and, more frequently, at the public broadcaster TV Cultura. Expect international distribution rights holders, it had already been made available on local streaming platforms Looke and Globoplay. Starting from 2024, the previous 13 series will be available at the upcoming streaming service +SBT.

====Asia====
Series 1 through 3 of Doctor Who were broadcast on various NHK channels from 2006 to 2008 with Japanese subtitles. Beginning on 2 August 2009, upon the launch of Disney XD in Japan, the series has been broadcast with Japanese dubbing.

===Home media===

A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on UMD for the PlayStation Portable. Eight original series serials have been released on Laserdisc and many have also been released on Betamax tape and Video 2000. One episode of Doctor Who (The Infinite Quest) was released on VCD. Initially, only the series from 2005 onwards were also available on Blu-ray, along with the 1996 TV film &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, released in September 2016. However in March 2021, it was announced that the classic run would be released on Blu-ray starting with seasons 12 and 19.

Over 600 episodes of the classic series (the first 8 Doctors, from 1963 to 1996) are available to stream on BritBox (launched in 2017) and Pluto TV. From 2020, the revival series is available for streaming on HBO Max, as well as spin-offs &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot;. Ahead of the 60th anniversary of the series, BBC cleared the rights to allow almost every single non-missing episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; onto iPlayer. Additionally various spin-offs were also added to iPlayer including &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, &quot;Class&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;.

==Adaptations and other appearances==
===Films===

There are two Dr. Who feature films: &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, released in 1965 and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; in 1966. Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, &quot;The Daleks&quot; and &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.

In these films, Peter Cushing plays a human scientist named &quot;Dr. Who&quot; who travels with his granddaughter, niece, and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The Cushing version of the character reappears in both comic strips and a short story, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series. In addition, several planned films were proposed, including a sequel, &quot;The Chase&quot;, loosely based on the original series story, for the Cushing Doctor, plus many attempted television movie and big-screen productions to revive the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after the original series was cancelled.

Paul McGann starred in the only television film as the eighth incarnation of the Doctor. After the film, he continued the role in audio dramas and was confirmed as the eighth incarnation through flashback footage and a mini episode in the 2005 revival, effectively linking the two series and the television movie.

In 2011, David Yates announced that he had started work with the BBC on a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; film, a project that would take three or more years to complete. Yates indicated that the film would take a different approach from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although then showrunner Steven Moffat stated later that any such film would not be a reboot of the series and that a film should be made by the BBC team and star the current TV Doctor.

===Spin-offs===

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot;. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled &quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot;. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote &quot;The Curse of the Daleks&quot;, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode (&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;) for a potential spin-off series, &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, aired in 1981, with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled &quot;Torchwood&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Two other actresses who appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; also star in the series: Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Unquiet Dead&quot;, and Naoko Mori, who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato, first seen in &quot;Aliens of London&quot;. A second series of &quot;Torchwood&quot; aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called &quot;Children of Earth&quot; which was set largely in London. A fourth series, &quot;&quot; jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show&#x27;s setting.

&quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year&#x27;s Day 2007, and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a fourth season featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011 – uncompleted due to Sladen&#x27;s death in early 2011.

An animated serial, &quot;The Infinite Quest&quot;, aired alongside the 2007 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as part of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Totally Doctor Who&quot;. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; website in 2009.

&quot;Class&quot;, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show&#x27;s first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled.

On 27 January 2023, Russell T Davies confirmed via GQ that future &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs were in the works. At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2024, Davies confirmed a new spin-off series, &quot;The War Between the Land and the Sea&quot;, was in development. Davies wrote the spin-off with Pete McTighe, which will consist of five parts, and is set to be directed by Dylan Holmes Williams. Jemma Redgrave and Alexander Devrient are expected to reprise their roles from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart and Colonel Ibrahim, while Russell Tovey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who portrayed characters in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, were cast as new characters. The series is expected to see the return of the Sea Devils.

Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series &quot;Faction Paradox&quot;, &quot;Iris Wildthyme&quot; and &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot;; as well as the made-for-video series &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot;; the Australian-produced television series &quot;K-9&quot;, which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD; and the audio spin-off &quot;Counter-Measures&quot;.

===Aftershows===
When the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;. There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled &quot;Doctor Who: The Fan Show&quot;, which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner. Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode that preceded it.

===Charity episodes and appearances===
In 1983, coinciding with the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; was shown as part of the annual BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983. This was the programme&#x27;s first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.

In 1993, for the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, another charity special, &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, was produced for &quot;Children in Need&quot;, featuring all the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the action taking place in the latter&#x27;s Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect, requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.
In 1999, another special, &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks. During the special, the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer of the revived series.

Since the return of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, the franchise has produced two original &quot;mini-episodes&quot; to support Children in Need. The first, which aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene introducing David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by &quot;Time Crash&quot;, a 7-minute scene that featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor, Peter Davison.

A set of two mini-episodes, titled &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During &quot;Children in Need 2011&quot;, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. &quot;Children in Need 2012&quot; featured the mini-episode &quot;The Great Detective&quot;. In 2014, the Twelfth Doctor Peter Capaldi designed a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed Paddington Bear statue, which was located at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich (one of 50 placed around London), which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

===Spoofs and cultural references===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom—Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry. Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; series. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;,
&quot;Community&quot; as Inspector Spacetime, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. As part of the 50th-anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote, and co-starred in the parody &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;, which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and had cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant, and Matt Smith.

There have also been many references to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in popular culture and other science fiction, including &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;The Neutral Zone&quot;) and &quot;Leverage&quot;. In the Channel 4 series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (created by later &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producer Russell T. Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme. In a similar manner, the character of Oliver on &quot;Coupling&quot; (created and written by Steven Moffat) is portrayed as a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; collector and enthusiast.
References to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novels &quot;Brisingr&quot; and &quot;High Wizardry&quot;, the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, the Adult Swim comedy show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes &quot;Blue Harvest&quot; and &quot;420&quot;, and the game &quot;RuneScape&quot;. It has also been referenced in &quot;Destroy All Humans! 2&quot;, by civilians in the game&#x27;s variation of England, and multiple times throughout the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series. It has been featured in &quot;Good Omens&quot; through the first &quot;Doctor Who Annual&quot;.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; has been a reference in several political cartoons, from a 1964 cartoon in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; depicting Charles de Gaulle as a Dalek to a 2008 edition of &quot;This Modern World&quot; by Tom Tomorrow in which the Tenth Doctor informs an incredulous character from 2003 that the Democratic Party will nominate an African-American as its presidential candidate.

The word &quot;TARDIS&quot; is an entry in the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.&quot;

===Audio===
The earliest &quot;Doctor Who&quot;–related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story &quot;The Chase&quot; released in 1966. Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; &quot;Doctor Who and the Pescatons&quot; featuring the Fourth Doctor. The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story &quot;State of Decay&quot; in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, &quot;Slipback&quot;, the first radio drama, was transmitted.

Since 1999, Big Finish Productions has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD. The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann&#x27;s Eighth Doctor joining the line in 2001. Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012. Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks. The 2013 series &quot;Destiny of the Doctor&quot;, produced as part of the series&#x27; 50th-anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016, the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures, before receiving his own range. In August 2020, Big Finish announced a new series of audios beginning release in May 2021, featuring Christopher Eccleston reprising his role as the Ninth Doctor.

The main range, &quot;Doctor Who: The Monthly Adventures&quot;, holds the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the longest-running science fiction audio play series. In 2020 Big Finish revealed that &quot;The Monthly Adventures&quot; would come to an end in favor of individual box sets.

In 2022, BBC Sounds began airing &quot;Doctor Who: Redacted&quot;, a podcast written by Juno Dawson and starring Charlie Craggs and Jodie Whittaker. The podcast focuses on a trio of friends who host a paranormal conspiracy podcast, &quot;The Blue Box Files&quot;, and end up getting involved in much more than they expected. The podcast was later renewed for a second series.

===Books===
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels has been published by BBC Books. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; (&quot;DWM&quot;) with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979: &quot;DWM&quot; is recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest running TV tie-in magazine, celebrating 40 years of continuous publication on 11 October 2019. This is published by Panini, as is the &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot; magazine for younger fans.

===Video games===
Numerous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; video games have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day. A &quot;Doctor Who&quot; game was planned for the Sega Mega Drive but never released. One of the recent ones is a match-3 game released in November 2013 for iOS, Android, Amazon App Store and Facebook called &quot;Doctor Who: Legacy&quot;. It has been constantly updated since its release and features all the Doctors as playable characters as well as over 100 companions.

Another video game instalment is Lego Dimensions – in which Doctor Who is one of the many &quot;Level Packs&quot; in the game. The pack contains the Twelfth Doctor (who can reincarnate into the others), K9, the TARDIS and a Victorian London adventure level area. The game and pack released in November 2015.

&quot;Doctor Who: Battle of Time&quot; was a digital collectible card game developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment and released for iOS and Android. It was soft-launched on 30 May 2018 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand, but was shut down on 26 November of that same year.

&quot;Doctor Who Infinity&quot; was released on Steam on 7 August 2018. It was nominated for &quot;Best Start-up&quot; at The Independent Game Developers&#x27; Association Awards 2018.

==Chronology and canonicity==
Since the creation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances. The BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity.

==Awards==
The show has received recognition as one of Britain&#x27;s finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies&#x27; tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor, and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first woman to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work as Missy.

In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with an Institutional Peabody &quot;for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe.&quot; The programme is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running science-fiction television show in the world, as the &quot;most successful&quot; science-fiction series of all time—based on its overall broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic—and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th-anniversary special.

In 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children&#x27;s Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the &quot;Auntie Awards&quot; as the culmination of their &quot;TV60&quot; series, celebrating 60 years of BBC television broadcasting, where &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was voted as the &quot;Best Popular Drama&quot; the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was ranked third in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, produced by the British Film Institute and voted on by industry professionals. In 2005, the series came first in a survey by &quot;SFX&quot; magazine of &quot;The Greatest UK Science Fiction and Fantasy Television Series Ever&quot;. In Channel 4&#x27;s 2001 list of the 100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV shows, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was placed at number nine. In 2004 and 2007, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was ranked number 18 and number 22 on TV Guide&#x27;s Top Cult Shows Ever. In 2013, TV Guide ranked it as the sixth-best sci-fi show.

The revived series has received recognition from critics and the public, across various awards ceremonies. It won five BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Drama Series, the highest-profile and most prestigious British television award for which the series has ever been nominated. It was very popular at the BAFTA Cymru Awards, with 25 wins overall including Best Drama Series (twice), Best Screenplay/Screenwriter (thrice) and Best Actor. It was also nominated for 7 Saturn Awards, winning the only Best International Series in the ceremony&#x27;s history. In 2009, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was voted the 3rd greatest show of the 2000s by Channel 4, behind &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. The episode &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot; was shortlisted for a Mind Award at the 2010 Mind Mental Health Media Awards for its &quot;touching&quot; portrayal of Vincent van Gogh.

It has won the Short Form of the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the oldest science fiction/fantasy award for films and series, six times since 2006. The winning episodes were &quot;The Empty Child&quot;/&quot;The Doctor Dances&quot; (2006), &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot; (2007), &quot;Blink&quot; (2008), &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot; (2010), &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;/&quot;The Big Bang&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2012). The 2016 Christmas special &quot;The Return of Doctor Mysterio&quot; was also a finalist for the 2017 Hugo Awards. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; star Matt Smith won Best Actor in the 2012 National Television awards alongside Karen Gillan, who won Best Actress.

As a British series, the majority of its nominations and awards have been for national competitions such as the BAFTAs, but it has occasionally received nominations in mainstream American awards, most notably a nomination for &quot;Favorite Sci-Fi Show&quot; in the 2008 People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and the series has been nominated multiple times in the Spike Scream Awards, with Smith winning Best Science Fiction Actor in 2011. The Canadian Constellation Awards have also recognised the series. In 2019, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame based in Seattle, Washington.

This analysis is framed specifically by the Freudian notion of the uncanny, and suggests that Moffat&#x27;s work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; confronts unconscious perceptions, repressed fears and death itself through storytelling techniques which attempt to connect directly with the audience by deconstructing the distance between material reality and the fantasy space of the series.

<doc id="8211" wikidata="Q41980" url="?curid=8211" title="Democritus">
<text>Democritus (, ; , &quot;Dēmókritos&quot;, meaning &quot;chosen of the people&quot;; – ) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from Abdera, primarily remembered today for his formulation of an atomic theory of the universe. Democritus wrote extensively on a wide variety of topics.

None of Democritus&#x27; original work has survived, except through second-hand references. Many of these references come from Aristotle, who viewed him as an important rival in the field of natural philosophy. He was known in antiquity as the ‘laughing philosopher’ because of his emphasis on the value of cheerfulness.

==Life==
Democritus was born in Abdera, on the coast of Thrace. He was a polymath and prolific writer, producing nearly eighty treatises on subjects such as poetry, harmony, military tactics, and Babylonian theology. He traveled extensively, visiting Egypt and Persia, but wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed by these countries. He once remarked that he would rather uncover a single scientific explanation than become the king of Persia. Although many anecdotes about Democritus&#x27; life survive, their authenticity cannot be verified and modern scholars doubt their accuracy. Ancient accounts of his life have claimed that he lived to a very old age, with some writers claiming that he was over a hundred years old at the time of his death.

==Philosophy and science==
Democritus wrote on ethics as well as physics. Democritus was a student of Leucippus. Early sources such as Aristotle and Theophrastus credit Leucippus with creating atomism and sharing its ideas with Democritus, but later sources credit only Democritus, making it hard to distinguish their individual contributions.

===Atomic hypothesis===
We have various quotes from Democritus on atoms, one of them being:
He concluded that divisibility of matter comes to an end, and the smallest possible fragments must be bodies with sizes and shapes, although the exact argument for this conclusion of his is not known. The smallest and indivisible bodies he called &quot;atoms.&quot; Atoms, Democritus believed, are too small to be detected by the senses; they are infinite in numbers and come in infinitely many varieties, and they have existed forever and that these atoms are in constant motion in the void or vacuum. The middle-sized objects of everyday life are complexes of atoms that are brought together by random collisions, differing in kind based on the variations among their constituent atoms. For Democritus, the only true realities are atoms and the void. What we perceive as water, fire, plants, or humans are merely combinations of atoms in the void. The sensory qualities we experience are not real; they exist only by convention. Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said, &quot;The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is.&quot; However, his exact position on atomic weight is disputed.

His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases. Democritus, along with Leucippus and Epicurus, proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved. Using analogies from humans&#x27; sense experiences, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes, others with balls and sockets.

The Democritean atom is an inert solid that excludes other bodies from its volume and interacts with other atoms mechanically. Quantum-mechanical atoms are similar in that their motion can be described by mechanics in addition to their electric, magnetic and quantum interactions. They are different in that they can be split into protons, neutrons, and electrons. The elementary particles are similar to Democritean atoms in that they are indivisible but their collisions are governed purely by quantum physics. Fermions observe the Pauli exclusion principle, which is similar to the Democritean principle that atoms exclude other bodies from their volume. However, bosons do not, with the prime example being the elementary particle photon.

==== Correlation with modern science ====
The theory of the atomists appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. Classical atomists could not have had an empirical basis for modern concepts of atoms and molecules.

The atomistic void hypothesis was a response to the paradoxes of Parmenides and Zeno, the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult-to-answer arguments in favor of the idea that there can be no movement. They held that any movement would require a void—which is nothing—but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was &quot;You say there &quot;is&quot; a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void.&quot; The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is &quot;something&quot;, for instance light waves.

The atomists agreed that motion required a void, but simply rejected the argument of Parmenides on the grounds that motion was an observable fact. Therefore, they asserted, there must be a void.

Democritus held that originally the universe was composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger units—including the earth and everything on it. He surmised that there are many worlds, some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end and that a world could be destroyed by collision with another world.

=== Mathematics ===

Democritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in particular. According to Archimedes, Democritus was among the first to observe that a cone and pyramid with the same base area and height has one-third the volume of a cylinder or prism respectively, a result which Archimedes states was later proved by Eudoxus of Cnidus. Plutarch also reports that Democritus worked on a problem involving the cross-section of a cone that Thomas Heath suggests may be an early version of infinitesimal calculus.

===Anthropology===

Democritus thought that the first humans lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, foraging individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit which grew wild on the trees, until fear of wild animals drove them together into societies. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.

===Ethics ===
Democritus was eloquent on ethical topics. Some sixty pages of his fragments, as recorded in Diels–Kranz, are devoted to moral counsel. The ethics and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims. In placing the quest for happiness at the center of moral philosophy, he was followed by almost every moralist of antiquity. The most common maxims associated with him are &quot;&quot;Accept favours only if you plan to do greater favours in return&quot;, and he is also believed to impart some controversial advice such as &quot;It is better not to have any children, for to bring them up well takes great trouble and care, and seeing them grow up badly is the cruellest of all pains&quot;&quot;. He also wrote a treatise on the purpose of life and the nature of happiness. He held that &quot;&quot;happiness was not to be found in riches but in the goods of the soul and one should not take pleasure in mortal things&quot;. Another saying that is often attributed to him is &quot;The hopes of the educated were better than the riches of the ignorant&quot;. He also stated that &quot;the cause of sin is ignorance of what is better&quot; which become a central notion later in the Socratic moral thought. Another idea he propounded which was later echoed in the Socratic moral thought was the maxim that &quot;you are better off being wronged than doing wrong&quot;&quot;. His other moral notions went contrary to the then prevalent views such as his idea that &quot;A good person not only refrains from wrongdoing but does not even want to do wrong.&quot; for the generally held notion back then was that virtue reaches it apex when it triumphs over conflicting human passions.

===Aesthetics===

Later Greek historians consider Democritus to have established aesthetics as a subject of investigation and study, as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher&#x27;s oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus writings on these matters, only a small percentage of his thoughts and ideas can be known.

==Works==
Diogenes Laertius attributes several works to Democritus, but none of them have survived in a complete form.

; Ethics: &quot;Pythagoras&quot;, &quot;On the Disposition of the Wise Man&quot;, &quot;On the Things in Hades&quot;, &quot;Tritogenia&quot;, &quot;On Manliness or On Virtue&quot;, &quot;The Horn of Amaltheia&quot;, &quot;On Contentment&quot;, &quot;Ethical Commentaries&quot;

A collections of sayings credited to Democritus have been preserved by Stobaeus, as well as a collection of sayings ascribed to Democrates which some scholars including Diels and Kranz have also ascribed to Democritus.

==Legacy==
Diogenes Laertius claims that Plato disliked Democritus so much that he wished to have all of his books burned. He was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle, and was the teacher of Protagoras.

Democritus is evoked by English writer Samuel Johnson in his poem, &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot; (1749), ll. 49–68, and summoned to &quot;arise on earth, /With chearful wisdom and instructive mirth, /See motley life in modern trappings dress&#x27;d, /And feed with varied fools th&#x27;eternal jest.&quot;

<doc id="8212" wikidata="Q876737" url="?curid=8212" title="Disc golf">
<text>Disc golf, also known as frisbee golf, is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target, using rules similar to golf.

The sport is usually played on a course with 9 or 18 holes, each consisting of a teeing area and target (basket). Players complete a hole by throwing a disc from a tee pad or tee area toward a basket, throwing again from where the previous throw came to rest, until the disc comes to rest in the designated basket. Disc golf targets are composed of a metal basket supported by a center pole, with chains hanging from an upper band. They are designed to catch the incoming discs, which then fall into the basket.

Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each basket is tallied (most often in relation to par), and players seek to complete each hole in the lowest number of total throws. Par is considered to be the number of strokes a skilled player is expected to make for a given hole or a group of holes (usually 9 or 18).

The game is played in about 40 countries, and as of 2023, there are active members of the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) worldwide. According to the UDisc course directory, there are over 15,000 disc golf courses, with roughly 90% being accessible for free.

== Origin and early history ==

Modern disc golf started in the early 1960s, but there is debate over who came up with the idea first. The consensus is that multiple groups of people played independently throughout the 1960s. Students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, for example, held tournaments with trees as targets as early as 1964, and in the early 1960s, players in Pendleton King Park in Augusta, Georgia, would toss Frisbees into 50-gallon barrel trash cans designated as targets. In 1968 Frisbee Golf was also played in Alameda Park in Santa Barbara, California, by teenagers in the Anacapa and Sola street areas. Gazebos, water fountains, lamp posts, and trees were all part of the course. This took place for several years and an Alameda Park collectors edition disc still exists, though rare, as few were made. Clifford Towne from this group went on to hold a National Time Aloft record.

=== 1970s ===
Ed Headrick, also known as &quot;Steady&quot; Ed Headrick, (June 28, 1924 – August 12, 2002) was an American toy inventor. He is most well known as the father of both the modern-day Frisbee and of the sport and game of disc golf.

In 1975, Headrick&#x27;s tenure at Wham-O where he helped redesign the flying disc known as the frisbee ended, and ties between Headrick and Wham-O eventually split. Headrick left the company to start out on his own to focus all his efforts on his new interest, which he coined and trademarked &quot;Disc Golf&quot;.

In 1976, &quot;Steady&quot; Ed Headrick and his son Ken Headrick started the first disc golf company, the Disc Golf Association (DGA). The purpose of DGA was to manufacture discs and baskets and to formalize the sport. The first disc golf target was Ed&#x27;s pole hole design which consisted of a pole sticking out of the ground.

== Courses ==
Most disc golf courses have 9 or 18 holes, and exceptions most often have holes in multiples of three. Courses with 6, 10, 12, 21, 24 or 27 holes are not uncommon. The PDGA recommends that courses average per hole, with holes no shorter than . The longest holes in the world measure more than long. Course designers use trees, bushes, elevation changes, water hazards, and distance variation, along with out-of-bounds zones and mandatory flight paths (often referred to as &quot;Mandos&quot;) to make each hole challenging and unique. Many courses include multiple tee positions or multiple target positions to cater to players of different ability levels.

Most disc golf courses are built in more natural and less manicured environments than golf and require minimal maintenance, although some courses aim for pristine conditions. Professional course designers consider safety a critical factor in course design, and are careful to minimize the danger of being hit by a flying disc while providing designs that create strategy in play and variety in shots for enjoyment. Holes are designed to require a range of different throws to challenge players with different strengths or particular skills. Many courses are central organizing points for local disc golf clubs, and some include shops selling disc golf equipment. More than 80% of the courses listed on Disc Golf Course Review are listed as public and free to play.

=== List by country ===
Three countries account for 85% of all disc golf courses worldwide: the United States (75%), Finland (7%) and Canada (3%). Other notable countries include Sweden and Estonia, which has the highest density of disc golf courses per km2 of dry land of any country and the second-highest number of courses per capita. Iceland and Finland have 150 and 111 courses per million inhabitants, respectively. Outside the North American and European continents, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea have the most courses. There are disc golf courses on every continent, including 24 in Latin America, 8 in Africa, and one in Antarctica. Åland has been defined as the world&#x27;s largest single disc golf park, with one course in each of the 16 municipalities of Åland.

=== Tees ===
A disc golf tee (commonly referred to as a tee pad, tee box or the box) is the starting position of a hole. The PDGA recommends that the tee area be no smaller than 1.2 meters wide by 3 meters long, allowing ample space to run up and release the disc. The tee box is usually a pad of concrete, asphalt, rubber, gravel, or artificial turf. Some courses have natural turf with only the front of the tee position marked. In rare instances, there are no tee boxes and players begin from a general location based on the course layout.

=== Signs ===
Established courses have tee signs near each tee position. Signs may depict a simple map of the hole including the tee, target, expected disc flight, out-of-bounds areas, water hazards, trees, and mandatory paths. Signs typically include the distance to the hole and par. Some courses include a unique name for the hole and may have sponsor logos. Many courses include a larger sign near the course entrance which has a map of the entire course.

=== Targets ===
Although early courses were played using trees, fence posts, or park equipment as the target, standard disc golf baskets are by far the most common type of target on modern courses. Some courses feature tone targets that are designed to make a distinctive sound when hit with a disc. Disc golf baskets are constructed with a central pole holding a basket under an assembly of hanging chains. When a disc hits the chains, it is often, but not always, deflected into the basket. Per PDGA rules, in order to complete a hole with a basket target, the disc must come to rest supported by the tray or the chains below the chain support. There are many different brands of baskets made by numerous manufacturers.

== Gameplay ==

The sport of disc golf is set up similar to a game of golf. A &quot;round&quot; is played on a disc golf course consisting of a number of &quot;holes&quot;, usually 9 or 18. Each hole includes a tee position for starting play and a disc golf target some distance away, often with obstacles such as trees, hills or bodies of water in between. Players begin by throwing a disc from the tee, without crossing over the front of the tee prior to releasing the disc when throwing. This could lead to a fault similar to a bowling foot fault in cricket. Players then navigate the hole by picking up the disc where it comes to rest and throwing again until they reach the target. The object of the game is to get through the course with the lowest number of total throws. Play is usually in groups of five or fewer, with each player taking turn at the tee box, then progressing with the player furthest from the hole throwing first, while the other players stand aside.

Each course is unique, and so requires a different combination of throws to complete, with the best players aiming to shape the flight of the disc to account for distance, terrain, obstacles and weather. In order to facilitate making different shots, players carry a variety of discs with different flight characteristics, choosing an appropriate disc for each throw. Some players also carry a mini marker disc, used to accurately mark the throwing position before each throw.  Use of mini marker discs is particularly prevalent in formal competitive play.

Many courses include out-of-bounds areas, commonly called &quot;OB zones&quot; or just &quot;OB&quot;. If the disc lands in these areas, the player is usually required to add a penalty throw onto their score and continue play from near where the disc entered the out-of-bounds zone. Some courses include out-of-bounds areas with special rules requiring the player to resume play from a specified area called a drop zone or requiring the player to restart the hole from the tee. Some courses also include Mandatories (also called &quot;Mandos&quot;) which require the path of the disc to be above, below or to one side of a specific line indicated by a sign.

By tradition, players throw from the tee box in the order of their score on the previous hole, with the lowest scorer throwing first. Most players also follow a loose code of courtesy while playing, which includes norms such as standing out of the sight line of the throwing player and avoiding making distracting noises. Because a thrown disc could injure someone, the Professional Disc Golf Association recommends that players &quot;Never throw into a blind area or when spectators, pedestrians or facility users are within range.&quot;

Formal competitive play is governed by the PDGA Official Rules of Disc Golf and the PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf events.

== Disc types ==
Disc golf discs are smaller than Ultimate flying discs or general-purpose recreational frisbees. They typically measure in diameter and weigh . All PDGA-approved discs measure in diameter and weigh no more than . Discs used for disc golf are designed and shaped for control, speed, and accuracy, while general-purpose flying discs, such as those used for playing guts or ultimate, have a more traditional shape, similar to a catch disc. There is a wide variety of discs used in disc golf and they are generally divided into three categories: drivers, mid-range discs, and putters.

=== Driver ===
Drivers are recognized by their sharp, beveled edge and have most of their mass concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally throughout. They are optimized for aerodynamics and designed to travel maximum distances at high speeds. They are typically thrown by experienced players during tee-off and other long distance fairway throws.

Some disc brands further sub-divide their drivers into different categories. For example, Innova has &quot;Distance Drivers&quot; and &quot;Fairway Drivers&quot;, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a distance driver and a mid-range disc. Discraft has three categories of drivers: &quot;Long Drivers&quot;, &quot;Extra Long Drivers&quot;, and &quot;Maximum Distance Drivers&quot;. Another type of driver, used less frequently, is a roller. As the name indicates, it has an edge designed to roll rather than fly. (Although any disc can be used for a roller, some behave quite differently than others.)

The world record distance for a golf disc was once , thrown by Simon Lizotte on October 25, 2014. David Wiggins Jr. broke the record with a distance of on March 28, 2016.

=== Mid-range ===
Mid-range discs feature a dull, beveled edge and a moderate rim width. They offer more control than drivers, but they have a smaller range. Mid-range discs are typically used as approach discs. Beginner players will often use mid-ranges instead of drivers at tee-off, as they require less strength and technique to fly straight than higher speed drivers.

=== Putter ===
Putters are designed to fly straight, predictably, and very slowly compared to mid-range discs and drivers. They are typically used for tight, controlled shots that are close to the basket, although some players use them for short drives where trees or other obstacles come into play. Additionally, higher speed discs will not fly properly without a fast enough release snap, so a putter or mid-range with lower snap requirements is more forgiving and will behave in a more regular way. Professional players often carry multiple putters with varying flight characteristics.

=== Stability ===
Stability is the measurement of a disc&#x27;s tendency to bank laterally during its flight. A disc that is over-stable will tend to track left (for a right-handed, backhand throw), whereas a disc that is under-stable will tend to track right (also for a right-handed, backhand throw). The stability rating of the discs differs depending on the manufacturer of the disc. Innova Discs rate stability as &quot;turn&quot; and &quot;fade&quot;. &quot;Turn&quot; references how the disc will fly at high speed during the beginning and middle of its flight, and is rated on a scale of +1 to −5, where +1 is the most overstable and −5 is the most understable. &quot;Fade&quot; references how the disc will fly at lower speeds towards the end of its flight, and is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, where 0 has the least fade, and 6 has the most fade. For example, a disc with a turn of −5 and fade of 0 will fly to the right (for right handed, backhand throw) the majority of its flight then curl back minimally left at the end. A disc with a turn of −1 and a fade of +3 will turn slightly right during the middle of its flight and turn hard left as it slows down. These ratings can be found on the discs themselves or from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site. Discraft prints the stability rating on all discs and also provides this information on their web site. The stability ranges from 3 to −2 for Discraft discs; however Discraft&#x27;s ratings are more of a combination of turn and fade with the predominance being fade.

Spin (rotation) has little influence on lift and drag forces but impacts a disc&#x27;s stability during flight. Imagine a spinning top: a gentle nudge will knock it off its axis of rotation momentarily, but it will not topple over because spin adds gyroscopic stability. In the same way, a flying disc resists rolling (flipping over) because spin adds gyroscopic stability. A flying disc will maintain its spin rate even as it loses velocity. Toward the end of a disc&#x27;s flight, when the spin and velocity lines cross, a flying disc will predictably begin to fade. The degree to which a disc will fade depends on its pitch angle and design.

=== Plastics ===
There are dozens of different types of plastic used for making discs by the various disc manufacturers. The type of plastic affects the feel of the disc&#x27;s grip as well as its durability, which in turn affects its flight pattern as the disc becomes worn. &quot;Base plastics&quot; such as DX, J-Pro, Pro-D, X-Line, D-line, retro, and R-Pro from Innova, Latitude 64°, Discmania, and Discraft are some of the less durable, but good for beginners due to their lower prices, compared to the higher end plastics. &quot;Premium plastics&quot;, such as Champion, Titanium, FLX, GStar, Gold Line, Tournament Plastic, Fuzion and Star, which are the best offered from the same companies, have the best quality, durability and flight compared to the other types available. There are also plastics that provide additional functionality, e.g. glow in the dark plastic and plastic that allows the disc to float in water. Most companies also offer a line of plastic that is much lighter than the maximum throwing weight (normally filled with air bubbles) which is conducive to beginners or players with less arm speed. Players might prefer bright colored discs to contrast most green flora and recover their disc easier. The commercial production process typically used is injection molding for the low unit cost and reliability. For prototyping and small-scale offerings 3D printing is a growing option with the PDGA approved designs currently available for purchase from company&#x27;s such as NSH custom discs. 3D printed discs are typically produced using different plastics than traditional production methods, utilizing the printability characteristics of polymers such as TPU or specialized proprietary blends.

=== Stamps ===
Stamps refer to the artwork or lettering that appears on a disc. Stamps can appear on the top or the bottom of a disc. Stamps are applied by disc manufacturers by using a hot stamp machine, usually with foil. Stamps not only serve a creative design purpose, but are also used to identify different disc molds.

== Throwing styles ==
While there are many different grips and styles to throwing the disc, there are two basic throwing techniques: backhand and forehand (or sidearm). These techniques vary in effectiveness under different circumstances. Their understanding and mastery can greatly improve a player&#x27;s game and offer diverse options in maneuvering the disc to the basket with greater efficacy. Many players use what is referred to as a &quot;run-up&quot; during their drive. This is practiced to build more forward disc momentum and distance. Throwing styles vary from player to player, and there is no standard throwing style.

All discs when thrown will naturally fall to a certain direction determined by the rotation direction of the disc when released. This direction is termed &quot;hyzer&quot;, the natural fall of the disc, or &quot;anhyzer&quot;, making the disc fall against its natural flight pattern. For a right-handed backhand throw (RHBH), the disc will naturally fall to the left. For a right-handed forehand throw (RHFH), the disc will naturally fall to the right. For a left-handed, backhand throw (LHBH), the disc will naturally fall to the right. For a left-handed, forehand throw (LHFH), the disc will naturally fall to the left.

=== Backhand ===
To perform this throw, the disc is rapidly drawn from across the front of the body, and released towards a forward aimpoint. Due to the high level of potential spin generated with this technique, it often results in greater distance than with a forehand throw. Power is created by initiating momentum from the feet and allow it to travel up the body, hips, and shoulders, culminating in the transfer of energy to the disc.

=== Forehand ===
The forehand (sidearm) throw is performed by drawing the disc from behind and partially across the front of the body: similar to a sidearm throw in baseball. The term sidearm actually predates the term forehand, which is seemingly in use today as a simpler means to communicate the technique, equating to a tennis forehand.

=== Alternative throws ===
The following examples of throws may be used to better deliver a disc where the former common two throws would be impeded by obstacles such as bushes, trees, boulders, or artificial structures.

Common alternative styles
*The Hatchet (or Tomahawk). Gripped similarly to the sidearm toss but thrown with an overhand motion; the disc orientation is nearly perpendicular to the ground over much of the flight.
*The Thumber (or U.D.). Thrown in an overhand manner but with thumb held on the disc&#x27;s underside.
*The Roller. Thrown either backhand or forehand, the disc will predominately be in contact with the ground. The disc remains in motion while travelling on its edge at a slight angle and can travel exceedingly far in ideal situations. Once perfected, the roller is an invaluably versatile tool in the golfer&#x27;s arsenal.
*The Turbo-Putt Thrown with a putter when the player holds the disc upright, supported in the middle by the thumb, with the finger tips outside of the edge, somewhat like a waiter holding a platter. The player stands with the leg opposite from the throwing arm forward, reaches back, and then extends their arm towards the basket, throwing the disc in a motion similar to that of throwing a dart. Ideally the thrower&#x27;s wrist does not rotate; the act of following through will give the disc its spin. The Turbo-Putt is a throw known for its accuracy, but it has extremely limited range.

Other alternative styles
*The Baseball or Grenade. Thrown as in the backhand, but with the disc upside-down. This shot is used often to get up and down on a short shot where there is danger of a shot rolling away or going out of bounds if thrown too far. Primarily used on downhill shots but can be used to go up and over. Also due to the quick turn and backspin of this shot, it is sometimes used to get out of the woods.
*The Overhand wrist flip (or chicken-wing [ambiguous origin] ). This is a very difficult and stylized throw with which accomplished free-stylers and classic ultimate players are familiar; it is less used in disc golf. It is thrown in the same manner as the &quot;baseball&quot; but drawn on the sidearm side of the body, and by inverting the arm and disc. Using the thumb as the power finger, the disc is drawn from the thigh area rearwards and up from behind the body to over the shoulder, releasing toward a forward aimpoint. The disc flies in a conventional flight pattern. To the untrained eye, this appears to be an ungainly throw. It is, however, elegant and accurate. The term &quot;overhand wristflip&quot; has been in use since at least circa 1970.

== Scoring ==
Stroke play is the most common scoring method used in the sport but there are many other forms. These include match play, skins, speed golf and captain&#x27;s choice, which in disc golf is referred to as &quot;doubles&quot; (not to be confused with partner or team play).

Regardless of which form of play the participants choose, the main objectives of disc golf are conceptually the same as traditional golf in the sense that players follow the same scorekeeping technique.

Scoring terms for a single hole:

* Condor – Where a player is four throws under par, or &quot;-4&quot;.
* Albatross (or double-eagle) – Where a player is three throws under par, or &quot;-3&quot;.
* Eagle (or double-birdie) – Where a player is two throws under par, or &quot;-2&quot;.
* Birdie – Where a player is one throw under par, or &quot;-1&quot;.
* Par – Where a player has thrown par, &quot;E&quot; or &quot;0&quot;.
* Bogey – Where a player is one throw over par, or &quot;+1&quot;.
* Double Bogey – Where a player is two throws over par, or &quot;+2&quot;.
* Triple Bogey – Where a player is three throws over par, or &quot;+3&quot;.

Doubles play is a unique style of play that many local courses offer on a weekly basis. In this format, teams of two golfers are determined. Sometimes this is done by random draw, and other times it is a pro-am format. On the course, it is a &quot;best-disc&quot; scramble, meaning both players throw their tee shot and then decide which lie they would like to play. Both players then play from the same lie, again choosing which lie is preferable. The World Amateur Doubles Format includes best shot, alternate shot, best score (players play singles and take the best result from the hole) and worst shot (both players must sink the putt).

== Tournaments ==
Tournaments are held nationwide and yearlong in the United States. Sanctioned Tournament play is communicated through the Professional Disc Golf Association Membership. The PDGA provides international, professional, and amateur disc golf tournaments as well as communicates event results, opinions and other information beneficial to the sport via electronic and printed media. In 1982 the PDGA hosted the first World Championship Tournament. Since then, the World Championships have been held in 17 different American states, as well as Toronto, Ontario. One of the largest disc golf tournaments is the United States Disc Golf Championship, held in October in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

As a show of the year-round sustainability of the sport, annual winter tournaments, known as Ice Bowls, are held at courses around the world. Using the motto &quot;No Wimps, No Whiners&quot;, Ice Bowls collectively create sport awareness and are considered charity events that typically benefit a local food bank. The official website reports that the 2010 Ice Bowls raised over $250,000 and donated over 67,000 pounds of food in the 222 tournaments for the year. Other charitable tournaments include the annual St. Jude Disc Golf Tournament which started in 2017 and has raised over $100,000 for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

== Popularity ==

A website that tracks courses worldwide along with their opening dates has shown a rapid increase in installed permanent courses with an average of more than 400 new courses added each year between 2007 and 2017. The site lists 9744 courses worldwide .

During the COVID-19 pandemic, as shutdowns and social distancing forced people to avoid indoor gatherings, disc golf experienced significant growth. Televised events were broadcast on CBS Sports and ESPN2 for the first time.

Although most players play on a casual, amateur level, the professional disc golf scene is also growing rapidly, with the top professionals playing full-time and earning their livings through tournament winnings and sponsorship from equipment manufacturers. Online viewership of major tournaments and events has increased rapidly, with coverage of the 2019 world championship achieving more than 3 million views on YouTube, and a clip of an albatross by professional Philo Brathwaite gaining more than 1.4 million views.

=== Post-round coverage ===
Increased popularity of disc golf can be largely attributed to increased coverage of pro tour events, available for free on YouTube. Jomez Productions, Gatekeeper Media, and Gk Pro all film events the day of, and then air them the morning after. Often, these videos can have a reach of as many as 200,000 viewers. Jomez&#x27;s coverage of the final round of the 2019 World Championships has more than 5.5 million YouTube views. In the 2020 season, Jomez Productions and the Disc Golf Pro Tour reached an agreement with CBS Sports and ESPN 2 to air post production coverage of a tournament on each network. The Dynamic Discs Open was shown on CBS Sports, and the Disc Golf Pro Tour championship was re-aired on ESPN2 November 24, 2020. With 225,000 viewers, it was the most-watched show on the channel that day.

=== Women in disc golf ===
While there are more male than female players, the Women&#x27;s Disc Golf Association exists to encourage female players and arrange women&#x27;s tournaments. A PDGA survey from 2020 states that out of its 71,016 active members, 4,752 are female.

Several companies have started programs and websites to help attract women to the sport. The PDGA Women&#x27;s Committee is &quot;Dedicated to Attract, Encourage, and Retain Female Participation in Organized Disc Golf Events&quot;. The PDGA Women&#x27;s Committee set historical records on 12 May 2012 by running the Inaugural Women&#x27;s Global Event that attracted 636 female players in 24 states and 4 countries. The Women&#x27;s Global Event was expected to take place every two years from 2014, with hopes of increasing the number of participants. The 2021 Women&#x27;s Global Event had 99 registered tournaments that spanned the globe, from Minnesota to Malaysia, with a combined turnout of 3224 women competing in 23 different PDGA divisions.

There are also disc golf companies such as Disc-Diva, that have started up with a primary, though not exclusive, focus on women in the sport, promoting accessories geared towards women and using catch phrases like &quot;you wish you threw like a girl&quot;. Sassy Pants is another group that focuses on getting more involvement from women in the sport, advocating for sponsorship of women to enter tournaments.

Women&#x27;s disc golf teams are involved in the National Collegiate Disc Golf Championship, and the Mississippi State Women&#x27;s Team were the inaugural champions.

<text>The decimal numeral system (also called the base-ten positional numeral system and denary or decanary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is the extension to non-integer numbers (&quot;decimal fractions&quot;) of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as &quot;decimal notation&quot;.

A decimal numeral (also often just &quot;decimal&quot; or, less correctly, &quot;decimal number&quot;), refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified by a decimal separator (usually &quot;.&quot; or &quot;,&quot; as in or ). 
&quot;Decimal&quot; may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in &quot; is the approximation of to &quot;two decimals&quot;&quot;. Zero-digits after a decimal separator serve the purpose of signifying the precision of a value.

The numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[Decimal|decimal fractions]]. That is, fractions of the form , where is an integer, and is a non-negative integer. Decimal fractions also result from the addition of an integer and a &quot;fractional part&quot;; the resulting sum sometimes is called a &quot;fractional number&quot;.

Decimals are commonly used to approximate real numbers. By increasing the number of digits after the decimal separator, one can make the approximation errors as small as one wants, when one has a method for computing the new digits. 
Originally and in most uses, a decimal has only a finite number of digits after the decimal separator. However, the decimal system has been extended to &quot;infinite decimals&quot; for representing any real number, by using an infinite sequence of digits after the decimal separator (see decimal representation). In this context, the usual decimals, with a finite number of non-zero digits after the decimal separator, are sometimes called terminating decimals. A &quot;repeating decimal&quot; is an infinite decimal that, after some place, repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (e.g., ). An infinite decimal represents a rational number, the quotient of two integers, if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of non-zero digits.

==Origin==

Many numeral systems of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are firstly the Egyptian numerals, then the Brahmi numerals, Greek numerals, Hebrew numerals, Roman numerals, and Chinese numerals. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system for representing integers. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called &quot;decimal fractions&quot; or &quot;decimal numbers&quot;, for forming the &quot;decimal numeral system&quot;.

== Decimal notation ==

For writing numbers, the decimal system uses ten decimal digits, a decimal mark, and, for negative numbers, a minus sign &quot;−&quot;. The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; the decimal separator is the dot &quot; in many countries (mostly English-speaking), and a comma &quot; in other countries.

For representing a non-negative number, a decimal numeral consists of
* either a (finite) sequence of digits (such as &quot;2017&quot;), where the entire sequence represents an integer:
*:formula_1
*or a decimal mark separating two sequences of digits (such as &quot;20.70828&quot;)
::formula_2.
If , that is, if the first sequence contains at least two digits, it is generally assumed that the first digit is not zero. In some circumstances it may be useful to have one or more 0&#x27;s on the left; this does not change the value represented by the decimal: for example, . Similarly, if the final digit on the right of the decimal mark is zero—that is, if —it may be removed; conversely, trailing zeros may be added after the decimal mark without changing the represented number; for example, and .

For representing a negative number, a minus sign is placed before .

The numeral formula_2 represents the number
:formula_4.
The &quot;integer part&quot; or &quot;integral part&quot; of a decimal numeral is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also truncation). For a non-negative decimal numeral, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the &quot;fractional part&quot;, which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.

When the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in computing, that the integer part is not written (for example, , instead of ). In normal writing, this is generally avoided, because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.

In brief, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a positional numeral system.

== Decimal fractions ==

Decimal fractions (sometimes called decimal numbers, especially in contexts involving explicit fractions) are the rational numbers that may be expressed as a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten. For example, the decimal expressions formula_5 represent the fractions , , , and , and therefore denote decimal fractions. An example of a fraction that cannot be represented by a decimal expression (with a finite number of digits) is , 3 not being a power of 10. 

More generally, a decimal with digits after the separator (a point or comma) represents the fraction with denominator , whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.

It follows that a number is a decimal fraction if and only if it has a finite decimal representation.

Expressed as fully reduced fractions, the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are
:formula_6

===Approximation using decimal numbers===
Decimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all real numbers. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates , being less than 10−5 off; so decimals are widely used in science, engineering and everyday life.

More precisely, for every real number and every positive integer , there are two decimals and with at most &quot; digits after the decimal mark such that and .

Numbers are very often obtained as the result of measurement. As measurements are subject to measurement uncertainty with a known upper bound, the result of a measurement is well-represented by a decimal with digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by . In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same number, the decimal numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also significant figures).

==Infinite decimal expansion==
For a real number and an integer , let denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than &quot; that has exactly digits after the decimal mark. Let denote the last digit of . It is straightforward to see that may be obtained by appending to the right of . This way one has

and the difference of and amounts to
:formula_7,

which is either 0, if , or gets arbitrarily small as &#x27; tends to infinity. According to the definition of a limit, &#x27; is the limit of when &quot;&quot; tends to infinity. This is written asformula_8or
which is called an infinite decimal expansion of &quot;&quot;.

Conversely, for any integer and any sequence of digitsformula_9 the (infinite) expression is an &quot;infinite decimal expansion&quot; of a real number &#x27;. This expansion is unique if neither all are equal to 9 nor all are equal to 0 for &#x27; large enough (for all &quot;&quot; greater than some natural number ).

If all for equal to 9 and , the limit of the sequenceformula_10 is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: , by , and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see 0.999...).

Any such decimal fraction, i.e.: for , may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing by and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see 0.999...).

In summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of , and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining as the greatest number that is &quot;less&quot; than , having exactly &quot;&quot; digits after the decimal mark.

=== Rational numbers ===
Long division allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. If the rational number is a decimal fraction, the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a &quot;repeating decimal&quot;. For example,
: = 0.012345679012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).

The converse is also true: if, at some point in the decimal representation of a number, the same string of digits starts repeating indefinitely, the number is rational.

or, dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, .

== Decimal computation ==

Most modern computer hardware and software systems commonly use a binary representation internally (although many early computers, such as the ENIAC or the IBM 650, used decimal representation internally).
For external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related octal or hexadecimal systems.

For most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. (123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)

Both computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of binary-coded decimal, especially in database implementations, but there are other decimal representations in use (including decimal floating point such as in newer revisions of the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic).

Decimal arithmetic is used in computers so that decimal fractional results of adding (or subtracting) values with a fixed length of their fractional part always are computed to this same length of precision. This is especially important for financial calculations, e.g., requiring in their results integer multiples of the smallest currency unit for book keeping purposes. This is not possible in binary, because the negative powers of formula_11 have no finite binary fractional representation; and is generally impossible for multiplication (or division). See Arbitrary-precision arithmetic for exact calculations.

== History ==

Many ancient cultures calculated with numerals based on ten, perhaps because two human hands have ten fingers. Standardized weights used in the Indus Valley Civilisation () were based on the ratios: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, while their standardized ruler – the &quot;Mohenjo-daro ruler&quot; – was divided into ten equal parts. Egyptian hieroglyphs, in evidence since around 3000 BCE, used a purely decimal system, as did the Linear A script () of the Minoans and the Linear B script (c. 1400–1200 BCE) of the Mycenaeans. The Únětice culture in central Europe (2300-1600 BC) used standardised weights and a decimal system in trade. The number system of classical Greece also used powers of ten, including an intermediate base of 5, as did Roman numerals. Notably, the polymath Archimedes (c. 287–212 BCE) invented a decimal positional system in his Sand Reckoner which was based on 108. Hittite hieroglyphs (since 15th century BCE) were also strictly decimal.

The Egyptian hieratic numerals, the Greek alphabet numerals, the Hebrew alphabet numerals, the Roman numerals, the Chinese numerals and early Indian Brahmi numerals are all non-positional decimal systems, and required large numbers of symbols. For instance, Egyptian numerals used different symbols for 10, 20 to 90, 100, 200 to 900, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, to 10,000.
The world&#x27;s earliest positional decimal system was the Chinese rod calculus.
=== History of decimal fractions ===

Starting from the 2nd century BCE, some Chinese units for length were based on divisions into ten; by the 3rd century CE these metrological units were used to express decimal fractions of lengths, non-positionally. Calculations with decimal fractions of lengths were performed using positional counting rods, as described in the 3rd–5th century CE &quot;Sunzi Suanjing&quot;. The 5th century CE mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated a 7-digit approximation of. Qin Jiushao&#x27;s book &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; (1247) explicitly writes a decimal fraction representing a number rather than a measurement, using counting rods. The number 0.96644 is denoted
: .

Historians of Chinese science have speculated that the idea of decimal fractions may have been transmitted from China to the Middle East.

Al-Khwarizmi introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century CE, written with a numerator above and denominator below, without a horizontal bar. This form of fraction remained in use for centuries.

Positional decimal fractions appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician Abu&#x27;l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi written in the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350 but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamshid al-Kashi used, and claimed to have discovered, decimal fractions in the 15th century. 
A forerunner of modern European decimal notation was introduced by Simon Stevin in the 16th century. Stevin&#x27;s influential booklet &quot;De Thiende&quot; (&quot;the art of tenths&quot;) was first published in Dutch in 1585 and translated into French as &quot;La Disme&quot;.

John Napier introduced using the period (.) to separate the integer part of a decimal number from the fractional part in his book on constructing tables of logarithms, published posthumously in 1620.

=== Natural languages ===
A method of expressing every possible natural number using a set of ten symbols emerged in India. Several Indian languages show a straightforward decimal system. Dravidian languages have numbers between 10 and 20 expressed in a regular pattern of addition to 10.

The Hungarian language also uses a straightforward decimal system. All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as &quot;tizenegy&quot; literally &quot;one on ten&quot;), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as &quot;huszonhárom&quot; = &quot;three on twenty&quot;).

A straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 , 100 , 1000 , 10,000 ), and in which 11 is expressed as &quot;ten-one&quot; and 23 as &quot;two-ten-three&quot;, and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) 9 (thousand) 3 (hundred) 4 (tens) 5 is found in Chinese, and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities. Japanese, Korean, and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is &quot;eleven&quot; not &quot;ten-one&quot; or &quot;one-teen&quot;.

Incan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as &quot;ten with one&quot; and 23 as &quot;two-ten with three&quot;.

Some psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children&#x27;s counting ability.

=== Other bases ===
Some cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers.
* Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures such as the Maya used a base-20 system (perhaps based on using all twenty fingers and toes).
* The Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico have octal (base-8) systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.
* The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal (cognates to &quot;ten-count&quot; or &quot;tenty-wise&quot;); such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were. Where this counting system is known, it is based on the &quot;long hundred&quot; = 120, and a &quot;long thousand&quot; of 1200. The descriptions like &quot;long&quot; only appear after the &quot;small hundred&quot; of 100 appeared with the Christians. Gordon&#x27;s Introduction to Old Norse p. 293, gives number names that belong to this system. An expression cognate to &#x27;one hundred and eighty&#x27; translates to 200, and the cognate to &#x27;two hundred&#x27; translates to 240. Goodare details the use of the long hundred in Scotland in the Middle Ages, giving examples such as calculations where the carry implies i C (i.e. one hundred) as 120, etc. That the general population were not alarmed to encounter such numbers suggests common enough use. It is also possible to avoid hundred-like numbers by using intermediate units, such as stones and pounds, rather than a long count of pounds. Goodare gives examples of numbers like vii score, where one avoids the hundred by using extended scores. There is also a paper by W.H. Stevenson, on &#x27;Long Hundred and its uses in England&#x27;.
* Many or all of the Chumashan languages originally used a base-4 counting system, in which the names for numbers were structured according to multiples of 4 and 16.
* Many languages use quinary (base-5) number systems, including Gumatj, Nunggubuyu, Kuurn Kopan Noot and Saraveca. Of these, Gumatj is the only true 5–25 language known, in which 25 is the higher group of 5.
* Some Nigerians use duodecimal systems. So did some small communities in India and Nepal, as indicated by their languages.
* The Huli language of Papua New Guinea is reported to have base-15 numbers. &quot;Ngui&quot; means 15, &quot;ngui ki&quot; means 15 × 2 = 30, and &quot;ngui ngui&quot; means 15 × 15 = 225.
* Umbu-Ungu, also known as Kakoli, is reported to have base-24 numbers. &quot;Tokapu&quot; means 24, &quot;tokapu talu&quot; means 24 × 2 = 48, and &quot;tokapu tokapu&quot; means 24 × 24 = 576.
* Ngiti is reported to have a base-32 number system with base-4 cycles.
* The Ndom language of Papua New Guinea is reported to have base-6 numerals. &quot;Mer&quot; means 6, &quot;mer an thef&quot; means 6 × 2 = 12, &quot;nif&quot; means 36, and &quot;nif thef&quot; means 36×2 = 72.

<doc id="8216" wikidata="Q203711" url="?curid=8216" title="Dorians">
<text>The Dorians (; , , singular , ) were one of the four major ethnic groups into which the Hellenes (or Greeks) of Classical Greece divided themselves (along with the Aeolians, Achaeans, and Ionians). They are almost always referred to as just &quot;the Dorians&quot;, as they are called in the earliest literary mention of them in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where they already can be found inhabiting the island of Crete.

They were diverse in way of life and social organization, varying from the populous trade center of the city of Corinth, known for its ornate style in art and architecture, to the isolationist, military state of Sparta; and yet, all Hellenes knew which localities were Dorian and which were not. Dorian states at war could more likely, but not always, count on the assistance of other Dorian states. Dorians were distinguished by the Doric Greek dialect and by characteristic social and historical traditions.

In the 5th century BC, Dorians and Ionians were the two most politically important Greek , whose ultimate clash resulted in the Peloponnesian War. The degree to which fifth-century Hellenes self-identified as &quot;Ionian&quot; or &quot;Dorian&quot; has itself been disputed. At one extreme concludes that there was no true ethnic component in fifth-century Greek culture, in spite of anti-Dorian elements in Athenian propaganda. At the other extreme John Alty reinterprets the sources to conclude that ethnicity did motivate fifth-century actions. Moderns viewing these ethnic identifications through the 5th and 4th century BC literary tradition have been profoundly influenced by their own social politics. Also, according to E. N. Tigerstedt, nineteenth-century European admirers of virtues they considered &quot;Dorian&quot; identified themselves as &quot;Laconophile&quot; and found responsive parallels in the culture of their day as well; their biases contribute to the traditional modern interpretation of &quot;Dorians&quot;.

==Origin==
Accounts vary as to the Dorians&#x27; place of origin. One theory, widely believed in ancient times, is that they originated in the mountainous regions of Greece, such as Macedonia and Epirus, and obscure circumstances brought them south into the Peloponnese, to certain Aegean islands.

===Peloponnesian dialect replacement===
The origin of the Dorians is a multifaceted concept. In modern scholarship, the term has often meant the location of the population disseminating the Doric Greek dialect within a hypothetical Proto-Greek speaking population. The dialect is known from records of classical northwestern Greece, the Peloponnesus and Crete and some of the islands. The geographic and ethnic information found in the east&#x27;s earliest known literary work, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, combined with the administrative records of the former Mycenaean states, prove to universal satisfaction that East Greek (Ionian) speakers were once dominant in the Peloponnesus but suffered a setback there and were replaced at least in official circles by West Greek (Doric) speakers. A historical event is associated with the overthrow, called anciently the &quot;Return of the Heracleidai&quot; and by moderns the Dorian Invasion.

This theory of a return or invasion presupposes that West Greek speakers resided in northwest Greece but overran the Peloponnesus replacing the East Greek there with their own dialect. No records other than Mycenaean ones are known to have existed in the Bronze Age so a West Greek of that time and place can be neither proved nor disproved. West Greek speakers were in western Greece in classical times. Unlike the East Greeks, they are not associated with any evidence of displacement events. That provides circumstantial evidence that the Doric dialect disseminated among the Hellenes of northwest Greece, a highly-mountainous and somewhat-isolated region.

===Dorian invasion===
The Dorian invasion is a modern historical concept attempting to account for:
* at least the replacement of dialects and traditions in southern Greece in pre-classical times
* more generally, the distribution of the Dorians in Classical Greece
* the presence of the Dorians in Greece at all

On the whole, none of the objectives has been met, but the investigations served to rule out various speculative hypotheses. Most scholars doubt that the Dorian invasion was the main cause of the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. The source of the West Greek speakers in the Peloponnese remains unattested by any solid evidence.

===Post-migrational distribution of the Dorians===

Though most of the Dorians settled in the Peloponnese, they also settled on Rhodes and Sicily and in what is now Southern Italy. In Asia Minor existed the Dorian Hexapolis (the six great Dorian cities): Halikarnassos (Halicarnassus) and Knidos (Cnidus) in Asia Minor, Kos, and Lindos, Kameiros, and Ialyssos on the island of Rhodes. The six cities would later become rivals with the Ionian cities of Asia Minor. The Dorians also settled Crete. The origin traditions remained strong into classical times: Thucydides saw the Peloponnesian War in part as &quot;Ionians fighting against Dorians&quot; and reported the tradition that the Syracusans in Sicily were of Dorian descent. Other such &quot;Dorian&quot; colonies, originally from Corinth, Megara, and the Dorian islands, dotted the southern coasts of Sicily from Syracuse to Selinus. Also Taras was a Spartan colony.

==Identity==
===Ethnonym===
====Dorian of Bronze Age Pylos====
A man&#x27;s name, &quot;Dōrieus&quot;, occurs in the Linear B tablets at Pylos, one of the regions later invaded and subjugated by the Dorians. Pylos tablet Fn867 records it in the dative case as &quot;do-ri-je-we&quot;, *Dōriēwei, a third- or consonant-declension noun with stem ending in w. An unattested nominative plural, &quot;*Dōriēwes&quot;, would have become &quot;Dōrieis&quot; by loss of the w and contraction. The tablet records the grain rations issued to the servants of &quot;religious dignitaries&quot; celebrating a religious festival of Potnia, the mother goddess.

The nominative singular, &quot;Dōrieus&quot;, remained the same in the classical period. Many Linear B names of servants were formed from their home territory or the places where they came into Mycenaean ownership. Carl Darling Buck sees the &quot;-eus&quot; suffix as very productive. One of its uses was to convert a toponym to an anthroponym; for example, Megareus, &quot;Megarian&quot;, from Megara.
A &quot;Dōrieus&quot; would be from Dōris, the only classical Greek state to serve as the basis for the name of the Dorians. The state was a small one in the mountains of west central Greece. However, classical Doris may not have been the same as Mycenaean Doris.

====Dorians of upland Doris====
A number of credible etymologies by noted scholars have been proposed. Julius Pokorny derives Δωριεύς, &quot;Dōrieus&quot; from δωρίς, &quot;dōris&quot;, &quot;woodland&quot; (which can also mean upland). The &quot;dōri-&quot; segment is from the o-grade (either &quot;ō&quot; or &quot;o&quot;) of Proto-Indo-European &quot;*deru-&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, which also gives the Homeric Δούρειος Ἵππος (&quot;Doureios Hippos&quot;, &quot;Wooden Horse&quot;). This derivation has the advantage of naming the people after their wooded, mountainous country.

====Lancers====
A second popular derivation was given by the French linguist, Émile Boisacq, from the same root, but from Greek (&quot;doru&quot;) &#x27;spear-shaft&#x27; (which was made of wood); i.e., &quot;the people of the spear&quot; or &quot;spearmen.&quot; In this case the country would be named after the people, as in Saxony from the Saxons. However, R. S. P. Beekes doubted the validity of this derivation and asserted that no good etymology exists.

====Chosen Greeks====
It sometimes happens that different derivations of an Indo-European word exploit similar-sounding Indo-European roots. Greek &quot;doru&quot;, &quot;lance,&quot; is from the o-grade of Indo-European *&quot;deru&quot;, &quot;solid,&quot; in the sense of wood. It is similar to an extended form, *&quot;dō-ro-&quot;, of &quot;*dō-&quot;, (give), as can be seen in the modern Greek imperative δώσε (&quot;dose&quot;, &quot;give [sing.]!&quot;) appearing in Greek as δῶρον (&quot;dōron&quot;, &quot;gift&quot;). This is the path taken by Jonathan Hall, relying on elements taken from the myth of the Return of the Herakleidai.

Hall cites the tradition, based on a fragment of the poet, Tyrtaeus, that &quot;Sparta is a divine gift granted by Zeus and Hera&quot; to the Heracleidae. In another version, Tyndareus gives his kingdom to Heracles in gratitude for restoring him to the throne, but Heracles &quot;asks the Spartan king to safeguard the gift until his descendants might claim it.&quot;

Hall, therefore, proposes that the Dorians are the people of the gift. They assumed the name on taking possession of Lacedaemon. Doris was subsequently named after them. Hall makes comparisons of Spartans to Hebrews as a chosen people maintaining a covenant with God and being assigned a Holy Land. To arrive at this conclusion, Hall relies on Herodotus&#x27; version of the myth (see below) that the Hellenes under Dorus did not take his name until reaching the Peloponnesus. In other versions the Heracleidae enlisted the help of their Dorian neighbors. Hall does not address the problem of the Dorians not calling Lacedaemon Doris, but assigning that name to some less holy and remoter land. Similarly, he does not mention the Dorian servant at Pylos, whose sacred gift, if such it was, was still being ruled by the Achaean Atreid family at Lacedaemon.

A minor, and perhaps regrettably forgotten, episode in the history of scholarship was the attempt to emphasize the etymology of Doron with the meaning of &#x27;hand&#x27;. This in turn was connected to an interpretation of the famous lambda on Spartan shields, which was to rather stand for a hand with outstanding thumb than the initial letter of Lacedaimon. Given the origin of the Spartan shield lambda legend, however, in a fragment by Eupolis, an Athenian comic poet, there has been a recent attempt to suggest that a comic confusion between the letter and the hand image may yet have been intended.

===Social structure===
Dorian social structure was characterized by a communal social structure and separation of the sexes. The lives of free men centered around military campaigns. When not abroad, men stayed in all-male residences focusing on military training until the age of 30, regardless of marital status.

Dorian women had greater freedom and economic power than women of other Greek ethnicities. Unlike other Hellenic women, Dorian women were able to own property, manage their husbands&#x27; estate, and delegate many domestic tasks to slaves. Women in ancient Sparta possessed the greatest agency and economic power, likely due to the prolonged absences of men during military campaigns. Dorian women wore the peplos, which was once common to all Hellenes. This tunic was pinned at the shoulders by brooches and had slit skirts which bared the thighs and permitted more freedom of movement than the voluminous Ionian chiton (costume).

===Distinctions of language===

The Doric dialect was spoken in northwest Greece, the Peloponnese, Crete, southwest Asia Minor, the southernmost islands of the Aegean Sea, and the various Dorian colonies of Magna Graecia in Southern Italy and Sicily. After the classical period, it was mainly replaced by the Attic dialect upon which the Koine or &quot;common&quot; Greek language of the Hellenistic period was based. The main characteristic of Doric was the preservation of Proto-Indo-European , long , which in Attic-Ionic became , . A famous example is the valedictory phrase uttered by Spartan mothers to their sons before sending them off to war: ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς (&quot;ḕ tàn ḕ epì tâs&quot;, literally &quot;either with it or on it&quot;: return alive with your shield
or dead upon it) would have been ἢ τὴν ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς (&quot;ḕ tḕn ḕ epì tês&quot;) in the Attic-Ionic dialect of an Athenian mother. Tsakonian, a descendant of Doric Greek, is still spoken in some parts of the southern Argolid coast of the Peloponnese, in the modern prefecture of Arcadia.

===Other cultural distinctions===

Culturally, in addition to their Doric dialect of Greek, Doric colonies retained their characteristic Doric calendar that revolved round a cycle of festivals, the Hyacinthia and the Carneia being especially important.

The Dorian mode in music also was attributed to Doric societies and was associated by classical writers with martial qualities.

The Doric order of architecture in the tradition inherited by Vitruvius included the Doric column, noted for its simplicity and strength.

The Dorians seem to have offered the central mainland cultus for Helios. The scattering of cults of the sun god in Sicyon, Argos, Ermioni, Epidaurus and Laconia, and his holy livestock flocks at Taenarum, seem to suggest that the deity was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared to other parts of ancient Greece. Additionally, it may have been the Dorians to import his worship to Rhodes.

==Ancient traditions==
In Greek historiography, the Dorians are mentioned by many authors. The chief classical authors to relate their origins are Herodotus, Thucydides and Pausanias. The most copious authors, however, lived in Hellenistic and Roman times, long after the main events. This apparent paradox does not necessarily discredit the later writers, who were relying on earlier works that did not survive. The customs of the Spartan state and its illustrious individuals are detailed at great length in such authors as Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus.

===Homer===
The &quot;Odyssey&quot; has one reference to the Dorians:There is a land called Crete, in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities. They have not all the same speech, but their tongues are mixed. There dwell Achaeans, there great-hearted native Cretans, there Cydonians, and Dorians of waving plumes, and goodly Pelasgians.
The reference is not compatible with a Dorian invasion that brought Dorians to Crete only after the fall of the Mycenaean states. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus and his relatives visit those states. Two solutions are possible, either the &quot;Odyssey&quot; is anachronistic or Dorians were on Crete in Mycenaean times. The uncertain nature of the Dorian invasion defers a definitive answer until more is known about it. Also, the Messenian town of Dorium is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships. If its name comes from Dorians, it would imply there were settlements of the latter in Messenia during that time as well.

===Tyrtaeus===
Tyrtaeus, a Spartan poet, became advisor of the Lacedaemonians in their mid-7th-century war to suppress a rebellion of the Messenians. The latter were a remnant of the Achaeans conquered &quot;two generations before&quot;, which suggests a rise to supremacy at the end of the Dark Age rather than during and after the fall of Mycenae. The Messenian population was reduced to serfdom.

Only a few fragments of Tyrtaeus&#x27; five books of martial verse survive. His is the earliest mention of the three Dorian tribes: Pamphyli, Hylleis, Dymanes. He also says: 

Erineus was a village of Doris. He helped to establish the Spartan constitution, giving the kings and elders, among other powers, the power to dismiss the assembly. He established a rigorous military training program for the young including songs and poems he wrote himself, such as the &quot;Embateria or Songs of the Battle-Charge which are also called Enoplia or Songs-under-Arms&quot;. These were chants used to establish the timing of standard drills under arms. He stressed patriotism:

===Herodotus===
Herodotus was from Halicarnassus, a Dorian colony on the southwest coast of Asia Minor; following the literary tradition of the times he wrote in Ionic Greek, being one of the last authors to do so. He described the Persian Wars, giving a thumbnail account of the histories of the antagonists, Greeks and Persians.
Herodotus gives a general account of the events termed &quot;the Dorian Invasion&quot;, presenting them as transfers of population. Their original home was in Thessaly, central Greece. He goes on to expand in mythological terms, giving some of the geographic details of the myth:1.56.2-3 And inquiring he found that the Lacedemonians and the Athenians had the pre-eminence, the first of the Dorian and the others of the Ionian race. For these were the most eminent races in ancient time, the second being a Pelasgian and the first a Hellenic race: and the one never migrated from its place in any direction, while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings; for in the reign of Deucalion this race dwelt in Pthiotis, and in the time of Doros the son of Hellen in the land lying below Ossa and Olympos, which is called Histiaiotis; and when it was driven from Histiaiotis by the sons of Cadmos, it dwelt in Pindos and was called Makednian; and thence it moved afterwards to Dryopis, and from Dryopis it came finally to Peloponnesus, and began to be called Dorian.

1.57.1-3 What language however the Pelasgians used to speak I am not able with certainty to say. But if one must pronounce judging by those that still remain of the Pelasgians who dwelt in the city of Creston above the Tyrsenians, and who were once neighbours of the race now called Dorian, dwelling then in the land which is now called Thessaliotis, and also by those that remain of the Pelasgians who settled at Plakia and Skylake in the region of the Hellespont, who before that had been settlers with the Athenians, and of the natives of the various other towns which are really Pelasgian, though they have lost the name,—if one must pronounce judging by these, the Pelasgians used to speak a Barbarian language. If therefore all the Pelasgian race was such as these, then the Attic race, being Pelasgian, at the same time when it changed and became Hellenic, unlearnt also its language. For the people of Creston do not speak the same language with any of those who dwell about them, nor yet do the people of Phakia, but they speak the same language one as the other: and by this it is proved that they still keep unchanged the form of language which they brought with them when they migrated to these places.

1.58 As for the Hellenic race, it has used ever the same language, as I clearly perceive, since it first took its rise; but since the time when it parted off feeble at first from the Pelasgian race, setting forth from a small beginning it has increased to that great number of races which we see, and chiefly because many Barbarian races have been added to it besides. Moreover it is true, as I think, of the Pelasgian race also, that so far as it remained Barbarian it never made any great increase. 

Thus, according to Herodotus, the Dorians did not name themselves after Dorus until they had reached Peloponnesus. Herodotus does not explain the contradictions of the myth; for example, how Doris, located outside the Peloponnesus, acquired its name. However, his goal, as he relates in the beginning of the first book, is only to report what he had heard from his sources without judgement. In the myth, the Achaeans displaced from the Peloponnesus gathered at Athens under a leader Ion and became identified as &quot;Ionians&quot;.

Herodotus&#x27; list of Dorian states is as follows. From northeastern Greece were Phthia, Histiaea and Macedon. In central Greece were Doris (the former Dryopia) and in the south Peloponnesus, specifically the states of Lacedaemon, Corinth, Sicyon, Epidaurus and Troezen. Hermione was not Dorian but had joined the Dorians. Overseas were the islands of Rhodes, Cos, Nisyrus and the Anatolian cities of Cnidus, Halicarnassus, Phaselis and Calydna. Dorians also colonised Crete including founding of such towns as Lato, Dreros and Olous. The Cynurians were originally Ionians but had become Dorian under the influence of their Argive masters.

===Thucydides===
Thucydides professes little of Greece before the Trojan War except to say that it was full of barbarians and that there was no distinction between barbarians and Greeks. The Hellenes came from Phthiotis. The whole country indulged in and suffered from piracy and was not settled. After the Trojan War, &quot;Hellas was still engaged in removing and settling.&quot;

Some 60 years after the Trojan War the Boeotians were driven out of Arne by the Thessalians into Boeotia and 20 years later &quot;the Dorians and the Heraclids became masters of the Peloponnese.&quot; So the lines were drawn between the Dorians and the Aeolians (here Boeotians) with the Ionians (former Peloponnesians).

Other than these few brief observations Thucydides names but few Dorians. He does make it clear that some Dorian states aligned or were forced to align with the Athenians while some Ionians went with the Lacedaemonians and that the motives for alignment were not always ethnic but were diverse. Among the Dorians was Lacedaemon, Corcyra, Corinth and Epidamnus, Leucadia, Ambracia, Potidaea, Rhodes, Cythera, Argos, Syracuse, Gela, Acragas (later Agrigentum), Acrae, Casmenae.

He does explain with considerable dismay what happened to incite ethnic war after the unity between the Greek states during the Battle of Thermopylae. The Congress of Corinth, formed prior to it, &quot;split into two sections.&quot; Athens headed one and Lacedaemon the other:For a short time the league held together, till the Lacedaemonians and Athenians quarreled, and made war upon each other with their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later were drawn.
He adds: &quot;the real cause I consider to be ... the growth of the power of Athens and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon...&quot;

===Plato===
In the Platonic work &quot;Laws&quot; is mentioned that the Achaeans who fought in the Trojan War, on their return from Troy were driven out from their homes and cities by the young residents, so they migrated under a leader named Dorieus and hence they were renamed &quot;Dorians&quot;.
Now during this period of ten years, while the siege lasted, the affairs of each of the besiegers at home suffered much owing to the seditious conduct of the young men. For when the soldiers returned to their own cities and homes, these young people did not receive them fittingly and justly, but in such a way that there ensued a vast number of cases of death, slaughter, and exile. So they, being again driven out, migrated by sea; and because Dorieus was the man who then banded together the exiles, they got the new name of &quot;Dorians&quot;, instead of &quot;Achaeans&quot;. But as to all the events that follow this, you Lacedaemonians relate them all fully in your traditions.

===Pausanias===
The &quot;Description of Greece&quot; by Pausanias relates that the Achaeans were driven from their lands by Dorians coming from Oeta, a mountainous region bordering on Thessaly. They were led by Hyllus, a son of Heracles, but were defeated by the Achaeans. Under other leadership they managed to be victorious over the Achaeans and remain in the Peloponnesus, a mythic theme called &quot;the return of the Heracleidae.&quot; They had built ships at Naupactus in which to cross the Gulf of Corinth. This invasion is viewed by the tradition of Pausanias as a return of the Dorians to the Peloponnesus, apparently meaning a return of families ruling in Aetolia and northern Greece to a land in which they had once had a share. The return is described in detail: there were &quot;disturbances&quot; throughout the Peloponnesus except in Arcadia, and new Dorian settlers. Pausanias goes on to describe the conquest and resettlement of Laconia, Messenia, Argos and elsewhere, and the emigration from there to Crete and the coast of Asia Minor.

===Diodorus Siculus===
Diodorus is a rich source of traditional information concerning the mythology and history of the Dorians, especially the &quot;Library of History&quot;. He does not make any such distinction but the fantastic nature of the earliest material marks it as mythical or legendary. The myths do attempt to justify some Dorian operations, suggesting that they were in part political.

Diodorus quoting from an earlier historian Hecataeus of Abdera details that during the Exodus many Israelites went into the islands of Greece and other places.

All the foreigners were forthwith expelled, and the most valiant and noble among them, under some notable leaders, were brought to Greece and other places, as some relate; the most famous of their leaders were Danaus and Cadmus. But the majority of the people descended into a country not far from Egypt, which is now called Judaea and at that time was altogether uninhabited.

Heracles was a Perseid, a member of the ruling family of Greece. His mother Alcmene had both Perseids and Pelopids in her ancestry. A princess of the realm, she received Zeus thinking he was Amphitryon. Zeus intended his son to rule Greece but according to the rules of succession Eurystheus, born slightly earlier, preempted the right. Attempts to kill Heracles as a child failed. On adulthood he was forced into the service of Eurystheus, who commanded him to perform 12 labors.

Heracles became a warrior without a home, wandering from place to place assisting the local rulers with various problems. He took a retinue of Arcadians with him acquiring also over time a family of grown sons, the Heraclidae. He continued this mode of life even after completing the 12 labors. The legend has it that he became involved with Achaean Sparta when the family of king Tyndareus was unseated and driven into exile by Hippocoön and his family, who in the process happened to kill the son of a friend of Heracles. The latter and his retinue assaulted Sparta, taking it back from Hippocoön. He recalled Tyndareus, set him up as a guardian regent, and instructed him to turn the kingdom over to any descendants of his that should claim it. Heracles went on with the way of life to which he had become accustomed, which was by today&#x27;s standards that of a mercenary, as he was being paid for his assistance. Subsequently, he founded a colony in Aetolia, then in Trachis.

After displacing the Dryopes, he went to the assistance of the Dorians, who lived in a land called Hestiaeotis under king Aegimius and were campaigning against the numerically superior Lapithae. The Dorians promised him of Doris (which they did not yet possess). He asked Aegimius to keep his share of the land &quot;in trust&quot; until it should be claimed by a descendant. He went on to further adventures but was poisoned by his jealous wife, Deianeira. He immolated himself in full armor dressed for combat and &quot;passed from among men into the company of the gods.&quot;

===Strabo===
Strabo, who depends on the books available to him, goes on to elaborate:

Beside this sole reference to Dorians in Crete, the mention of the &quot;Iliad&quot; of the Heraclid Tlepolemus, a warrior on the side of Achaeans and colonist of three important Dorian cities in Rhodes has been also regarded as a later interpolation.
