<text>The Carolina Panthers are a professional American football team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Panthers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The team is headquartered in Bank of America Stadium in Uptown Charlotte, which also serves as the team&#x27;s home field. The Panthers are supported throughout the Carolinas; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, it played its home games at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, during its first season in 1995.

The Panthers were announced as the league&#x27;s 29th franchise in 1993 and began play in 1995 under founding owner Jerry Richardson. The Panthers played well in their first two years, finishing in 1995 (an all-time best record for an NFL expansion team&#x27;s first season) and 12–4 the following year, winning the NFC West before ultimately losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. They did not have another winning season until 2003 when they won the NFC Championship Game and reached Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 32–29 to the New England Patriots. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to make another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles. After losing in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers in 2013 and the Seattle Seahawks in 2014, the Panthers returned to the Super Bowl in 2015 but lost to the Denver Broncos. Since then, the team has appeared in the playoffs only once, in 2017. The team&#x27;s five NFC South titles since the division&#x27;s establishment in 2002 rank second only to the New Orleans Saints.

The franchise is legally registered as Panther Football, LLC and are controlled by David Tepper, whose purchase of the team from founder Jerry Richardson was unanimously approved by league owners on May 22, 2018. The club, which &quot;Forbes&quot; valued at approximately US$2.3 billion in 2018, is estimated at $4.1 billion by it in 2023.

==History==
===Beginnings===
On December 15, 1987, entrepreneur Jerry Richardson announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-franchise the first Hardee&#x27;s restaurant in Spartanburg, SC, eventually expanding to a chain of franchises as co-founder of Spartan Food Systems before becoming president and CEO of Flagstar. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, and a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina who were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte.

To highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held preseason games around the area from 1989 to 1991. The first two games were held at Carter–Finley Stadium in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Kenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, while the third and final game was held at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 26, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously named the Carolina Panthers as the 29th member of the NFL. In the 1995 NFL draft, the Panthers selected quarterback Kerry Collins out of Penn State with their first ever draft selection.

===Jerry Richardson era (1995–2017)===

The Panthers first competed in the 1995 NFL season; they were one of two expansion teams to begin playing that year, the other being the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Panthers were put in the NFC West to increase the size of that division to five teams; there were already two other southeastern teams in the division, the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints. Former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Dom Capers was named the first head coach. The Panthers played their first regular season game in Week 1 of the 1995 season. The team fell to the Atlanta Falcons 23–20 in overtime. After a 0–5 start, with three close losses, the Panthers won their first game in franchise history, a 26–15 win over the New York Jets. The team finished its inaugural season , the best performance ever from a first-year expansion team. They performed even better in their second season, finishing with a record and winning the NFC West division, as well as securing a first-round bye. The Panthers beat the defending Super Bowl champions Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round 26–17 before losing the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers 30–13. The team managed only a finish in 1997 and slipped to in 1998, leading to Capers&#x27; dismissal as head coach.

The Panthers hired former San Francisco 49ers head coach George Seifert to replace Capers, and he led the team to an record in 1999. The team finished in 2000 and fell to in 2001, winning their first game but losing their last 15. This performance tied the NFL record for most losses in a single season, and it broke the record held by the winless 1976 Buccaneers for most consecutive losses in a single season (both records have since been broken by the 2008 Lions), leading the Panthers to fire Seifert. One highlight from the loss-ridden 2001 season was the drafting of future franchise wide receiver Steve Smith. He was a third-round selection in the 2001 NFL draft by the team.

==== John Fox years (2002–2010) ====

After the NFL&#x27;s expansion to 32 teams in 2002, the Panthers were relocated from the NFC West to the newly created NFC South division. The Panthers&#x27; rivalries with the Falcons and Saints were maintained, and they would be joined by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Panthers had the second overall pick in the 2002 NFL Draft. The team selected future Hall of Fame defensive end Julius Peppers out of North Carolina. New York Giants defensive coordinator John Fox was hired to replace Seifert and led the team to a finish in 2002. Although the team&#x27;s defense gave up very few yards, ranking the second-best in the NFL in yards conceded, they were hindered by an offense that ranked as the second-worst in the league in yards gained.

Prior to the 2003 season, the team signed quarterback Jake Delhomme. The Panthers improved to in the 2003 regular season, winning the NFC South. The Panthers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 29–10 in the Wild Card Round, the St. Louis Rams 29–23 in the Divisional Round, and the Philadelphia Eagles 14–3 in the NFC Championship. They advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII before losing to the New England Patriots, 32–29. The game was immediately hailed by sportswriter Peter King as the &quot;Greatest Super Bowl of all time&quot;. King felt the game &quot;was a wonderful championship battle, full of everything that makes football dramatic, draining, enervating, maddening, fantastic, exciting&quot; and praised, among other things, the unpredictability, coaching, and conclusion. The game is still viewed as one of the best Super Bowls of all time, and in the opinion of Charlotte-based NPR reporter Scott Jagow, the Panthers&#x27; Super Bowl appearance represented the arrival of Charlotte onto the national scene.

Following a start in 2004, the Panthers rebounded to win six of their last seven games despite losing 14 players for the season due to injury. They lost their last game to New Orleans, finishing the 2004 season at . Had they won the game, the Panthers would have made the playoffs. The team improved to in 2005, finishing second in the division behind Tampa Bay and clinching a playoff berth as a wild card. In the first round of the playoffs, the Panthers went on the road to face the New York Giants, beating them 23–0 for the NFL&#x27;s first playoff shutout against a home team since 1980. The following week, they beat Chicago 29–21 on the road, but lost key players Julius Peppers, a defensive end, and DeShaun Foster, a running back, who were both injured during the game. The Panthers were then defeated 34–14 by the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game, ending their season. Although the Panthers went into the 2006 season as favorites to win the NFC South and the free agent signing of Keyshawn Johnson, they finished with a disappointing record. The team finished the 2007 season with a record after losing quarterback Jake Delhomme early in the season due to an elbow injury.

In 2008, the Panthers rebounded with a regular season record, winning the NFC South and securing a first round bye. They were eliminated in the divisional round of the playoffs, losing 33–13 to the eventual NFC Champion Arizona Cardinals after Delhomme turned the ball over six times. Delhomme&#x27;s struggles carried over into the 2009 season, where he threw 18 interceptions in the first 11 games before breaking a finger in his throwing hand. The Panthers were at a record before Delhomme&#x27;s season-ending injury, and his backup, Matt Moore, led the team to a finish to the season for an overall record. In 2010, after releasing Delhomme in the offseason, the Panthers finished with a league-worst () record; their offense was the worst in the league. John Fox&#x27;s contract expired after the season ended, and the team did not retain him or his staff.

==== Ron Rivera years (2011–2019) ====
The team hired Ron Rivera to replace Fox as head coach and drafted Auburn&#x27;s Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Cam Newton with the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft. The Panthers opened the 2011 season , but finished with a record, and Newton was awarded the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award after setting the NFL record for most rushing touchdowns from a quarterback (14) in a single season and becoming the first rookie NFL quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a single season, thus setting the NFL rookie record. He also was the first rookie quarterback to rush for over 500 yards in a single season. 
After strengthening the defense with future all-pro Luke Kuechly in the first round of the 2012 draft, the Panthers again opened the 2012 season poorly, losing five out of their first six games, leading longtime general manager Marty Hurney to be fired in response. The team slid to a record before winning five of their last six games, resulting in a record. This strong finish helped save Rivera&#x27;s job. 
The Panthers had a winning season the following year, finishing with a record and winning their third NFC South title and another playoff bye, but they were beaten by the 49ers in the Divisional Round. In 2014, the Panthers opened the season with two wins, but after 12 games, sat at due in part to a seven-game winless streak. A four-game winning streak to end the season secured the team their second consecutive NFC South championship and a playoff berth, despite a losing record of . The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals, 27–16, in the wild card round to advance to the divisional playoffs, where they lost to eventual NFC champion Seattle, 31–17. The 2015 season saw the Panthers start the season and finish the season , which tied for the best regular-season record in NFC history. The team had the league&#x27;s top-scoring offense. During the same season, Cam Newton was named NFL MVP. The Panthers also secured their third consecutive NFC South championship, as well as their first overall top-seeded playoff berth. In the 2015–16 playoffs, the Panthers defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional playoffs, 31–24, after shutting them out in the first half, 31–0, and the Arizona Cardinals, 49–15, in the NFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl 50, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2003 season. The Panthers lost a defensive struggle to the AFC champion Denver Broncos, 24–10. In the 2016 season, the Panthers regressed on their 15–1 record from 2015, posting a 6–10 record and a last-place finish in the NFC South, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012, and losing the division title to the second-seeded Falcons, who went on to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LI. In 2017, the Panthers finished with an 11–5 record and a #5 seed. However, they lost to the New Orleans Saints 31–26 in the Wild Card Round, their first loss in that round in franchise history.

===David Tepper era (2018–present)===
On May 16, 2018, David Tepper, formerly a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, finalized an agreement to purchase the Panthers. The sale price was nearly $2.3 billion, a record. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. The sale officially closed on July 9, 2018. After starting 6–2, the Panthers finished the 2018 season 7–9. They began the 2019 season 5–3 but lost the last eight games to finish 5–11; late in the season, Tepper fired Rivera as head coach. Perry Fewell finished the season as interim coach, going 0–4. The 2019 season was marred with a season-ending injury to Cam Newton, who only played in two games that year. The Panthers turned to Kyle Allen and Will Grier at quarterback after Newton was out.

====Matt Rhule years (2020–2022)====
On January 7, 2020, the Panthers hired Baylor head coach Matt Rhule as head coach. On January 15, 2020, Luke Kuechly announced his retirement from the league. On March 17, 2020, the Panthers signed Teddy Bridgewater to a three-year $63 million contract. On March 24, the Carolina Panthers released their 2011 first overall pick and 2015 MVP quarterback Cam Newton. The Panthers had a difficult 2020 season, losing several close games. They would finish 5–11 for the second straight year.

Following the season, the Panthers traded for Sam Darnold from the New York Jets and shipped Bridgewater to the Denver Broncos. On November 11, 2021, the Panthers signed Cam Newton to a one-year deal after Darnold was put on injured reserve. However, the Panthers&#x27; struggles continued; despite winning their first three games of the 2021 season, they finished 5–12 and ended the season on a seven-game losing streak.

After the Panthers began the season with a 1–4 record, Rhule was fired as head coach on October 10, 2022, finishing his tenure with an 11–27 record in two and a half seasons. Steve Wilks was named interim head coach as a result. The Panthers then initiated a rebuild, trading players such as Robbie Anderson and Christian McCaffrey. Steve Wilks would go 6–6 as the interim head coach, as the Panthers would finish the season with a 7–10 record.

====Frank Reich year (2023)====
On January 26, 2023, former Indianapolis Colts head coach Frank Reich was hired as head coach. Reich was the first starting QB in Panthers history in 1995. Prior to the draft, the Panthers traded with the Chicago Bears to move up to the first overall pick. The trade involved Carolina swapping spots with the Bears and giving up their 2023 second-round pick, 2024 first-round pick, 2025 second-round pick, and wide receiver D. J. Moore. In the 2023 NFL draft, Reich&#x27;s first and only as the Panthers head coach, the Panthers selected their potential franchise quarterback in Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young out of Alabama with the first overall pick.

On November 27, 2023, Reich was fired after a 1–10 start. Special teams coordinator Chris Tabor coached the remainder of the 2023 season, going 1–5 in those games as the Panthers finished with a league-worst 2–15 record.

====Dave Canales (2024)====
On January 25, 2024, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Dave Canales was hired as head coach. In the first regular season game of the season, the Panthers lost to the New Orleans saints with a score of 10–47 with Bryce Young registering 13 completions from 30 attempts and being intercepted twice. The Panthers finished with a 5–12 record in the 2024 season.

==Logo and uniforms==
===Logo===
The shape of the Panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an &quot;aggressive, contemporary look&quot; as well as to give it a more three-dimensional feel. The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular brow and fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the old design, which had a shade similar to teal on top of black.

===Uniforms===
By the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers&#x27; logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be &quot;process blue&quot; (a shade lighter than Duke&#x27;s and darker than North Carolina&#x27;s), was the most difficult color to choose.

The team&#x27;s uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations, such as changing the sock color of the team&#x27;s black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team&#x27;s shoes from white to black. Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, said that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime.

The Panthers have three main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, designated their alternate uniforms, are the newest and were introduced in 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. Usually the Panthers opt for white or blue when the weather is expected to be hot and for black when the weather is expected to be cold.

The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants and blue socks, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants and black socks; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.
The first such instance was in 1998 when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the Indianapolis Colts. The second instance was in 2012 during a game against the Denver Broncos when they paired their black jerseys with new black pants; this created an all-black uniform, with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets. The decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain Steve Smith, who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms. The all-black uniforms won the &quot;Greatest Uniform in NFL History&quot; contest, a fan-voted contest run by NFL.com in July 2013. In July 2013, the team&#x27;s equipment manager, Jackie Miles, said the Panthers intended to use the all-black uniform more in the future. The Panthers wore the all-black uniform three times the following season, once each in the preseason and regular season, and the third time during the home divisional round playoff game vs the 49ers. During the Panthers&#x27; 2015 Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys, they debuted an all-blue uniform as part of Nike&#x27;s &quot;Color Rush&quot; series.

The team&#x27;s uniform did not change significantly after Nike became the NFL&#x27;s jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase &quot;Keep Pounding&quot;. Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team&#x27;s on-field battle, saying &quot;When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I&#x27;m a fighter. I kept pounding. You&#x27;re fighters, too. Keep pounding!&quot;

In 2019, the Panthers unveiled new uniforms. The new uniforms are Nike&#x27;s &quot;Vapor Untouchable&quot; and have only minor differences: the tapered strips on the pants are replaced by stripes that extend down to the socks, the reflective shoulder cloth was replaced and the hip logos were also removed. The uniforms keep the same basic look, colors, and numbers as the originals.

In 2022, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets, the Panthers unveiled secondary black helmets, which featured no white elements on the team logo.

==Stadium and practice facilities==

The Panthers played their first season at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, as their facility in uptown Charlotte was still under construction. Ericsson Stadium, called Bank of America Stadium since 2004, opened in the summer of 1996. The stadium was specially designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group for football and also serves as the headquarters and administrative offices of the Panthers. On some days, the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are some exceptions, and such tours must be arranged in advance.

Two bronze panther statues flank each of the stadium&#x27;s three main entrances; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States. The names of the team&#x27;s original PSL owners are engraved on the base of each statue. The first two people in the Panthers Hall of Honor, team executive Mike McCormack and linebacker Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Mills, in addition to being the only player in the Hall of Honor for over 20 years, is the only player to have had his jersey number (#51) retired by the Panthers .
The Panthers have three open-air fields next to Bank of America Stadium where they currently hold their practices; during the 1995 season, when the team played their home games in South Carolina, the team held their practices at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Because the practice fields, along with the stadium, are located in uptown Charlotte, the fields are directly visible from skyscrapers as well as from a four-story condominium located across the street. According to Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers&#x27; division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building&#x27;s top floor and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the Panthers organization. In order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing, the team has added &quot;strategically planted trees and a tarp over the ... fence surrounding the fields&quot;. Additionally, they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field. In the event of bad weather, the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about from the stadium. The team does not own this facility. The Panthers have hosted their annual training camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, since 1995.

===Team Headquarters===
The Panthers were planning on building a $1 billion team headquarters and training facility on a in Rock Hill, South Carolina, nicknamed &quot;The Rock&quot;. After six months of discussions and state approval of $115 million in incentives, the formal announcement of the team&#x27;s plan for a new practice facility came on June 5, 2019. Rock Hill mayor John Gettys described the project at that time as the biggest in the city&#x27;s history. Groundbreaking took place in July 2019, and it was expected to be completed by summer 2023. The agreement with Rock Hill, however, ended up being terminated on April 19, 2022, with owner David Tepper filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

==Culture==
The Panthers are supported in both North Carolina and South Carolina; South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley declared July 30, 2012, &quot;Carolina Panthers Day&quot; in her state, saying that &quot;when it comes to professional teams, the Carolina Panthers are the team that South Carolina calls their own&quot;. During the 2015 NFC Championship and Super Bowl, the hashtag #OneCarolina was used by college and professional sports teams from North Carolina and South Carolina to show unified support for the Panthers.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; graded the Panthers as having the 10th highest &quot;NFL Fan Value Experience&quot; in 2007, attributing much of the fan atmosphere to the team&#x27;s newness when compared to the established basketball fanbase. They also observed that the stadium has scattered parking lots, each of which has a different tailgating style. Some have fried chicken, pork, or Carolina-style barbecue, while others have live bands and televisions. Pickup football games in the parking lots are common. The Carolina Panthers have a home stadium capacity of just under 75,000, with home attendance ranking in the NFL&#x27;s top ten since 2006.

===Mascot, cheerleaders, and drumline===

Sir Purr, an anthropomorphic black panther who wears a jersey numbered &#x27;00&#x27;, has been the Panthers&#x27; mascot since their first season. During games, Sir Purr provides sideline entertainment through skits and &quot;silly antics&quot;. The mascot participates in a number of community events year-round, including a monthly visit to the patients at Levine Children&#x27;s Hospital. Sir Purr also hosts the annual Mascot Bowl, an event which pits pro and college mascots against each other during halftime at a selected Panthers home game.

The team&#x27;s cheerleaders are the Carolina Topcats who lead cheers and entertain fans at home games. The TopCats participate in both corporate and charity events. In March 2022, the Carolina Topcats became the first NFL cheerleading team to have a transgender member, Justine Lindsay. The team&#x27;s drumline is PurrCussion, an ensemble of snare, tenor, and bass drummers as well as cymbal players. PurrCussion performs for fans outside the stadium and introduces players prior to home games; it consists of drummers from across the Carolinas.

===Keep Pounding Drum===
Starting with the 2012 season, the Panthers introduced the Keep Pounding Drum, inspired by the aforementioned motivational speech by Sam Mills before the team&#x27;s 2004 playoff game against the Cowboys. Prior to each home game, an honorary drummer hits the six-foot-tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an American football game. According to the team, the drummers &quot;come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations, but all have overcome a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger&quot;. Drummers have included current and former Panthers players, military veterans, Make-A-Wish children, and athletes from other sports, including NBA MVP and Charlotte native Stephen Curry, US women&#x27;s national soccer team players Whitney Engen and Heather O&#x27;Reilly, and 7 time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson.

===Songs and traditions===
During the inaugural season of the Panthers, the team had an official fight song, which the team played before each home game. The song, &quot;Stand and Cheer&quot;, remains the team&#x27;s official fight song, but the team does not typically play it before home games. Due to negative fan reaction &quot;Stand and Cheer&quot; was pulled in 1999. Since 2006, the song has returned. The team plays Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; after home victories.
A &quot;keep pounding&quot; chant was introduced during the 2012 season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game. As prompted by the video boards, one side of the stadium shouts &quot;keep&quot; and the other side replies with &quot;pounding&quot;. The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games.

===Charity and community work===
The Carolina Panthers support a variety of non-profits in North and South Carolina through the Carolina Panthers Charities. Four annual scholarships are awarded to student athletes through the Carolina Panthers Graduate Scholarship and the Carolina Panthers Players Sam Mills Memorial Scholarship programs. Carolina Panthers Charities also offers grants to non-profits that support education, athletics, and human services in the community. The Panthers and Fisher Athletic have provided six equipment grants to high school football teams in the Carolinas each year since 2010. Carolina Panthers Charities raises funds at three annual benefits: the Countdown to Kickoff Luncheon, the team&#x27;s first public event each season; Football 101, an educational workshop for fans; and the Weekend Warrior Flag Football Tournament, a two-day non-contact flag football tournament. Another annual benefit is Taste of the Panthers, a gourmet food tasting which raises funds for Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina.

In 2003 the Panthers and Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Keep Pounding Fund, a fundraising initiative to support cancer research and patient support programs. The Panthers community has raised more than $1.4 million for the fund through direct donations, charity auctions, blood drives, and an annual 5k stadium run. The Panthers and Levine Children&#x27;s Hospital coordinate monthly hospital visits and VIP game-day experiences for terminally ill or hospitalized children.

In addition to these team-specific efforts, the Panthers participate in a number of regular initiatives promoted by the NFL and USA Football, the league&#x27;s youth football development partner. These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league&#x27;s Breast Cancer Awareness Month program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support military families and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.

===Radio and television===

Radio coverage is provided by flagship station WRFX and through the Carolina Panthers Radio Network, with affiliates throughout the Carolinas and Virginia. The Panthers&#x27; radio broadcasting team is led by play-by-play voice Anish Shroff, with Jake Delhomme as color analyst, and WBT sports director Jim Szoke as studio host. The radio network broadcasts pre-game coverage, games with commentary, and post-game wrap-ups. It also live-broadcasts &quot;Panther Talk&quot;, a weekly event at Bank of America Stadium which offers fans a chance to meet a player and ask questions of the staff.
National broadcasting and cable television networks cover regular-season games, as well as some preseason games. Locally, Fox affiliate WJZY airs most regular-season games, while home games against an AFC team typically air on CBS affiliate WBTV. Any appearances on Monday Night Football are simulcast on ABC affiliate WSOC-TV, while any appearances on Thursday Night Football are simulcast on WSOC. Sunday night and some Thursday night games are aired on NBC affiliate WCNC-TV.

All preseason games and team specials are televised by the Carolina Panthers Television Network on flagship station WSOC-TV in Charlotte and fourteen affiliate stations throughout the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. WSOC took over as the Panthers&#x27; television partner for the 2019 season, replacing longtime television partner WCCB, which had retained this role after losing the Fox affiliation to WJZY in 2013. As of 2021, the preseason television broadcasting team consists of play-by-play commentator Taylor Zarzour, color analyst and former Panthers player Steve Smith, and sideline reporter Kristen Balboni. The network also hosts &quot;The Panthers Huddle&quot;, a weekly show focusing on the Panthers&#x27; upcoming opponent.

The Panthers also offer game broadcasts in Spanish throughout both Carolinas and Mexico, with Jaime Moreno and Toño Ramos providing commentary.

==Rivalries==

The Panthers have developed heated rivalries with the three fellow members of the NFC South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints). The team&#x27;s fiercest rivals are the Falcons and Buccaneers.

The Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only south on I-85. The two teams have played each other twice a year since the Panthers&#x27; inception, and games between the two teams feature large numbers of the visiting team&#x27;s fans. As of the 2023 season, the Falcons lead the all-time series 36–22. The teams have never met in the postseason.

The Panthers&#x27; rivalry with Tampa Bay has been described as the most intense in the NFC South. The rivalry originated in 2002 with the formation of the NFC South, but became particularly heated before the 2003 season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as &quot;one of the most physical contests in recent memory&quot;. The rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams, some of which were caused by foul play. One of these plays, an illegal hit on Tampa Bay punt returner Clifton Smith, sparked a brief melee between the teams in 2009. As of 2023, the Panthers lead the all-time series 25–22. The two teams have never met in the postseason.

As of the 2023 season, the Saints lead the all-time series against the Panthers 31–28. The teams faced off in their lone postseason meeting in the 2017–18 postseason in the Wild Card Round with the Saints being victorious 31–26.

==Current staff==
==Players==
===Current roster===
===Hall of Honor===
The Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor was established in 1997 to honor individuals for their contributions to the Carolina Panthers organization.

===Retired numbers===
The Carolina Panthers have retired one number.

===Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinees===
Nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which &quot;honor[s] individuals who have made outstanding contributions to professional football&quot;, are determined by a 46-member selection committee. At least 80% of voters must approve the nominee for him to be inducted.

==Ownership and Administration==
===Jerry Richardson===
Jerry Richardson was the founder and first owner of the Carolina Panthers. Richardson and his family owned about 48% of the team, with the remaining 52% owned by a group of 14 limited partners. Richardson and the other investors paid $206 million for the rights to start the team in 1993.

===Team President===
Mike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Cleveland Browns and former coach and executive for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers&#x27; first team president, presiding in that role from 1994 until his retirement in 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson&#x27;s son, Mark, was appointed as the team&#x27;s second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father. Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as the athletic director of both Texas Christian University and Wofford College, Richardson&#x27;s alma mater. Morrison resigned in early 2017. The role was vacant until August 2018, when Tom Glick was hired as team president. He had previously served as the COO of Manchester City.

===David Tepper===
On May 16, 2018, David Tepper, formerly a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, finalized an agreement to purchase the Carolina Panthers, for nearly $2.3 billion, a record at the time. The agreement was approved by the league owners on May 22, 2018. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, the Panthers are worth approximately $2.3 billion . They ranked the Carolina Panthers as the 21st-most valuable NFL team and the 36th-most valuable sports team in the world.

===Coaches===
The Carolina Panthers have had ten head coaches. Eight have served in official capacity with two being interim coaches. Dom Capers was the head coach from 1995 to 1998 and led the team to one playoff appearance. Counting playoff games, he finished with a record of 31–35 (.470). George Seifert coached the team from 1999 to 2001, recording 16 wins and 32 losses (.333). John Fox, the team&#x27;s longest-tenured head coach, led the team from 2002 to 2010 and coached the team to three playoff appearances including Super Bowl XXXVIII which the Panthers lost. Including playoff games, Fox ended his tenure with a 78–74 (.513) record, making him the first Panthers coach to finish his tenure with the team with a winning record. Ron Rivera held the position from 2011 to 2019 and led the team to four playoff appearances including Super Bowl 50. Counting playoff games, he has a career record of 79–67–1 (.541). Statistically, Rivera holds the highest winning percentage of any Panthers head coach. On December 3, 2019, following a home loss against the Washington Redskins that sent the team&#x27;s record to 5–7, Rivera was fired by David Tepper. Perry Fewell, then the defensive backs coach for the team, was named interim head coach the same day. On January 7, 2020, Matt Rhule was hired to be the Panthers head coach. Rhule was fired during his third season, with Steve Wilks taking over on an interim basis. Frank Reich was hired head coach on January 26, 2023. Frank Reich was let go as head coach on November 27, 2023. Dave Canales was hired as head coach on January 25, 2024.

<text>The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based in Chicago. The Bears compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships, eight prior to the AFL–NFL merger and one Super Bowl. They also hold the NFL records for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears&#x27; NFL championships and overall victories are second behind the Green Bay Packers, with whom they have a long-standing rivalry.

The franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, on September 20, 1919, became professional on September 17, 1920, and moved to Chicago in 1921. It is one of two remaining franchises from the NFL founding in 1920, along with the Arizona Cardinals, which began in Chicago. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago&#x27;s North Side through the 1970 season; they have played since then at Soldier Field on the Near South Side, adjacent to Lake Michigan.

The team headquarters, Halas Hall, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season, and began hosting training camp at Halas Hall in 2020 after major renovations.

==History==
===1919–1939: Early Bears===

Originally named the Decatur Staleys, the club was established by the A. E. Staley food starch company of Decatur, Illinois, as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The team played independently in 1919, winning the Central Illinois Championship. The company hired George Halas and Edward &quot;Dutch&quot; Sternaman in 1920 to run the team. The 1920 Decatur Staleys season was their inaugural regular season completed in the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922).

Full control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman in 1921. Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.

The team moved to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the Chicago Staleys; Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, they received US$5,000 to keep the name &quot;Staleys&quot; for the 1921 season.

In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team moved into Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city&#x27;s baseball team (bears&#x27; young are called &quot;cubs&quot;). Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the University of Illinois, and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is Pantone 5395, navy blue, and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar to burnt orange).

The Staleys/Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league&#x27;s first six years, the Bears lost twice to the Canton Bulldogs (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.

The Bears&#x27; rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.

The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the Cleveland Bulldogs on December 7, even putting the title &quot;World&#x27;s Champions&quot; on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland. Their only losing season came in .

During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL&#x27;s long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college&#x27;s senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears&#x27; aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player Red Grange within a day of his final game as a collegian.

Despite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000–6,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000–50,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21–0. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team&#x27;s plays from Bears quarterback Joey Sternaman. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17–7 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60–3 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.

Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL&#x27;s New York Yankees, owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback Joey Sternaman, who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.

After the financial losses of the Championship season, Halas&#x27; partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the 1932 &quot;Unofficial&quot; NFL Championship, the Bears defeated the Portsmouth Spartans in the first NFL playoff game. Due to blizzard conditions in Chicago, the game was played at Chicago Stadium, marking it as the first indoor American football game.

The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the first NFL Championship, the Bears played against the New York Giants, defeating them 23–21. The teams met again in the 1934 NFL Championship where the Giants, wearing sneakers defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the Polo Grounds.

===1940s: The Monsters of the Midway===
From 1940 to 1947, quarterback Sid Luckman led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the University of Chicago&#x27;s discarded nickname &quot;Monsters of the Midway&quot; and their famous helmet wishbone-C, as well as a newly penned theme song that declared them &quot;The Pride and Joy of Illinois&quot;. One famous victory during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored Washington Redskins at Griffith Stadium in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results. The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The T-formation, as Halas named it, involved two running backs instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of the franchise&#x27;s most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, he set the Bears&#x27; passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. Many of Luckman&#x27;s records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by Jay Cutler in .
Cutler then went on to break Luckman&#x27;s franchise record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in .

===1950s–1968: Late-Halas era===

After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in to capture its eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985. The late 1960s and early-1970s produced notable players like Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, and Brian Piccolo, who died of embryonal carcinoma in 1970. The American television network ABC aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; Jack Warden won an Emmy Award for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.

Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#x27;s first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the American Football League, the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the National Football Conference, a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the George Halas Memorial Trophy.

===1969–1982: Struggles===

After the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season. In 1975, the Bears drafted Walter Payton from Jackson State University with their first pick. He won the NFL Most Valuable Player award in the 1977–78 season. Payton would go on to eclipse Jim Brown&#x27;s NFL career rushing record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until , when Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys surpassed it. Payton&#x27;s career and personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him &quot;Sweetness&quot;. He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.

On November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the chairman of the board. Their son Michael became the third president in team history. Virginia holds the honorary title of &quot;secretary of the board of directors&quot;, but has been called the glue that holds the franchise together. Virginia&#x27;s reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, George &quot;Mugs&quot; Halas Jr. as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a heart attack in 1979. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her &quot;The First Lady of Sports&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; has listed her as one of Chicago&#x27;s most powerful women.

===1983–1985: Contenders, then Super Bowl champions===

Mike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas in 1982. His gritty personality earned him the nickname &quot;Iron Mike&quot;. The team reached the NFC Championship game, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 23–0, in 1984. In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315-pound defensive tackle &quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry as a running back in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;. The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the &quot;unlucky 13th&quot; game of the season, a Monday night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins. At the time, much was made of the fact that the Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.

===1986–2003: Post-Super Bowl era===
After the 1985 championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Throughout the remainder of his tenure, Ditka led the Bears to five more postseason berths, getting as far as the NFC Championship in the 1988 season. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of Lovie Smith, the Bears had two head coaches, Dave Wannstedt and Dick Jauron. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.

Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, Dave McGinnis (Arizona&#x27;s defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms. Soon after Jauron&#x27;s hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the board. Phillips became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team. From 1997 to 2000, the Bears suffered four consecutive last place finishes within the division.

In the 2001 season, Jim Miller took over as the primary starting quarterback and helped lead the Bears to a resurgent 13–3 record and division title. The 2001 team did not see any postseason success as they fell 33–19 to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional Round. The 2002 season saw a setback as the team went 4–12. The team improved to a 7–9 record in 2003 but still missed the postseason. Jauron was fired following the end of the 2003 season.

===2004–2012: Lovie Smith era===
Lovie Smith, hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful Tampa 2 defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then Illinois head coach Ron Turner to improve the Bears&#x27; struggling offense. In , the Bears won their division and reached the playoffs for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in . The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to Super Bowl XLI. However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29–17 to the Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2006 season, the club decided to give Smith a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest-paid head coach in the National Football League.

The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in . Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs). On November 18, 2010, the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the Miami Dolphins.
The Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history, acquiring Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler from the Denver Broncos in exchange for Kyle Orton and draft picks on April 2, 2009. After a disappointing 2009 campaign with the team going 7–9, Mike Martz was hired as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator on February 1, 2010. On March 5, 2010, the Bears signed defensive end Julius Peppers, running back Chester Taylor, and tight end Brandon Manumaleuna, spending over $100 million on the first day of free agency. Also during the 2010 offseason, Michael McCaskey was replaced by brother George McCaskey as chairman of the Bears. With a 38–34 win against the New York Jets, the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. In their first Playoff game since Super Bowl XLI, The Bears defeated the No. 4 seed Seattle Seahawks 35–24 in the Divisional Round. The Bears reached the NFC Championship Game, where they played Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field – only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941. The Bears lost the game, 21–14.

The team started the 2011 season strong with a 7–3 record, and running back Matt Forté led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage. Eventually, quarterback Jay Cutler fractured his thumb, and Forté also was lost for the season against the Kansas City Chiefs after spraining his MCL, and the Bears, with Caleb Hanie playing, lost five straight before winning against the Minnesota Vikings with Josh McCown starting over Hanie. At season&#x27;s end, general manager Jerry Angelo was fired, and former Chiefs director of scouting and former Bears scout Phil Emery was brought in. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz resigned, and eventually retired, and was replaced by offensive line coach Mike Tice. The Bears made another notable move by trading for Miami Dolphins receiver and Pro Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall. The Bears became the first team in NFL history to return six interceptions for touchdowns in the first seven games of the season, with another pick-six by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing Chicago two behind the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers. However, the Bears missed the playoffs with a record of 10–6 (after starting the season 7–1, the first team to start with the record and miss the playoffs since the 1996 Washington Redskins), and Smith was fired on December 31.

===2013–2014: Marc Trestman years===
Then-CFL head coach and former NFL journeyman Marc Trestman was hired to succeed Smith after an exhaustive search that included at least 13 known candidates. On March 20, 2013, Brian Urlacher&#x27;s 13-year tenure with the Bears ended when both sides failed to agree on a contract. The Trestman era began on September 8 with a 24–21 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, making Trestman the fourth head coach in Bears history to win in his coaching debut, after George Halas (1920), Neill Armstrong (1978) and Dick Jauron (1999). The Bears ended the 2013 season 8–8, barely missing the playoffs after losing in the final week of the season to the Packers. Despite having a second-ranked offense that set numerous franchise records, the defense greatly worsened as it set franchise worsts in categories like yards allowed (6,313).

The following season was a disaster for the Bears, with the offense regressing to finish outside the top 20 in scoring. The team also allowed 50-point games in two straight weeks against the Patriots and Packers, including a franchise-high 42 points and NFL-record six touchdowns allowed in the first half against the latter, to become the first team since the 1923 Rochester Jeffersons to allow at least 50 points in consecutive games. The Bears ended the year 5–11 and last in the NFC North. Trestman and Emery were fired after the season ended.

===2015–2017: John Fox years===
The Bears hired Ryan Pace of the New Orleans Saints to be their new general manager on January 8, 2015. On January 16, 2015, John Fox accepted a four-year deal to become head coach. In Fox&#x27;s first season as head coach, the Bears saw improvements from 2014; after &quot;USA Today&quot; projected the Bears to win three games, they doubled that total and finished the season with a 6–10 record, including a Thanksgiving win over the Packers at Lambeau Field.

However, during the 2016 season, the Bears regressed heavily, compiling a 3–13 record (their worst since the NFL&#x27;s change to 16-game seasons in 1978). The season included several injuries to starters and secondary players, including Jay Cutler, who only played five games as a result of two separate injuries. Backup quarterback Brian Hoyer started the next three games before a broken arm put him out for the season. He was replaced by Matt Barkley, who made his first career start with the Bears. None of the three quarterbacks returned for the 2017 season.

In the 2017 NFL draft, the team selected quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the second-overall pick, who sat behind newly signed quarterback Mike Glennon for the first four games before taking over. The Bears ended the season 5–11 and again finished last in the NFC North. On January 1, 2018, Fox was fired, ending his tenure in Chicago with a 14–34 record.

===2018–2021: Matt Nagy years===

The Bears hired Matt Nagy from the Kansas City Chiefs as their new head coach in January 2018. General manager Ryan Pace signed receivers Taylor Gabriel, Allen Robinson, and Trey Burton in the offseason to complement second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. The Bears also acquired linebacker Khalil Mack in a block-blockbuster trade from the Oakland Raiders to further bolster their defense, sending a package of draft picks that includes 2019 and 2020 1st round draft picks in exchange. Nagy&#x27;s Bears clinched the NFC North on December 16, 2018, for the first time since 2010 with a 24–17 victory over the Green Bay Packers. The Bears finished the 2018 season with a 12–4 record. They lost to the defending Super Bowl Champions Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs after Cody Parkey&#x27;s game-winning field goal attempt was partially tipped and hit the uprights in the final seconds of the game, a play coined the &quot;Double Doink&quot;. Despite the first-round exit, Nagy was named Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) and Associated Press (AP). He was the first Bears coach to be given the AP award since Lovie Smith in 2005 and the fifth in team history.

In 2019, the team regressed to an 8–8 record, though Nagy&#x27;s combined 20 wins in 2018 and 2019 were the most by a Bears head coach in his first two seasons. During the year, renovations to Halas Hall were completed, allowing the team to move Training Camp from Ward Field on the campus of Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais, Illinois to Lake Forest for 2020.

The Bears opened the 2020 season with a 5–1 record. However, they lost their next six games. The Bears won three of their last four games to finish the season with an 8–8 record. Despite their finish, the Bears qualified for the 2020–21 NFL playoffs, which was expanded to include one additional wildcard team from each conference. The New Orleans Saints defeated the Bears in the opening round of the playoffs, 21–9. The team did not re-sign Trubisky after the 2020 season and instead allowed him to become a free agent.

Prior to the 2021 season, the Bears traded up in the 2021 NFL draft to select quarterback Justin Fields 11th overall. The team also signed veteran quarterback Andy Dalton in free agency. Dalton was initially declared the Bears starting quarterback, but Fields won the position after Dalton was injured. The Bears finished the season with a 6–11 record and missed the playoffs. Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace were fired after the season&#x27;s conclusion. Nagy posted a 34–33 record over four seasons with two playoff berths, while Pace compiled a 48–65 record over seven seasons.
===2022–2024: Matt Eberflus years===
On January 25, 2022, the Bears hired Ryan Poles as their general manager. The team hired Matt Eberflus as the franchise&#x27;s 17th head coach two days later. The Bears struggled throughout the 2022 season, which included a franchise-record 10-game losing streak. They finished with an NFL worst 3–14 record, which secured the team the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft. The Bears traded the first overall pick to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for wide receiver D. J. Moore and multiple draft picks. The Bears opened the 2023 season with a 0–4 record, extending the team losing streak to 14 (longest in team history; dating back to the 2022 season). The team bounced back by winning five of their last eight games, but finished with a 7–10 record, placing last in the NFC North for the second consecutive season. However, the team acquired the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, which was part of their previous trade with the Panthers, who finished the 2023 season with worst record in the NFL. The first overall pick was used on USC quarterback Caleb Williams. The Bears fired Eberflus on November 29, with five games remaining in the 2024 NFL season. Eberflus, who a posted a 14–32 overall record with the Bears, was the first head coach in team history to be fired before the end of the season.

===2025–present: Ben Johnson years===
On January 21, 2025, the Bears hired Ben Johnson as the franchise&#x27;s 18th head coach.
==Ownership==
The team is primarily owned by the heirs of George Halas. His daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey (holds 22.6% of the team shares), is the principal owner and votes on behalf of her 11 children and two nephews (who each own 3.8%) as well as the Brizzolara family (who own 8.33%), which amounts to an 80.33% ownership stake, allowing her to control the team. Former chairman and CEO of Aon Corp. Pat Ryan (17.67%) and former Aon director Andrew J. McKenna&#x27;s estate (2%) own the remainder 19.67% of the club. Ryan is also a board member. The McCaskey family has right of first refusal on stock sale, while Ryan&#x27;s block has second refusal rights.

In 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that the franchise is worth $3.525 billion, making it the seventh richest franchise in the NFL. Chicago is the third largest media market in the United States.

In a &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; article, one businessman described his wishes for the team to maximize its potential. In 2009, &quot;Yahoo! Sports&quot; listed the McCaskeys as the third worst owner in the NFL, stating &quot;[T]hey get less for what they&#x27;ve got than any team in our league.&quot;

===Ownership history===

The club was founded by A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company owner Augustus Eugene Staley in 1919 and was owned by the company until 1921. In 1921, Staley felt he could no longer afford the expensive burden of pro-football and transferred team ownership to Halas and paid him $5,000 for a sponsorship deal that kept the Staleys name for one more year. Halas than added Edward &quot;Dutch&quot; Sternaman as a second owner. On January 28, 1922, the Bears were incorporated at an NFL meeting, as &quot;a new league team&quot; after its name change. At season&#x27;s end, the two competed with agent Bill Harley for ownership of the Staleys, after he negotiated a contract that was to give his brother Chic Harley and himself one-third ownership of the team as part of his contract. However, Halas and Sternaman claimed that the contract was voided when a physical revealed health impairments resultant from Harley&#x27;s time in the war. The other league owners agreed to nullify the deal in favor of the Halas/Sternaman partnership by an 8–2 vote. In addition, Halas and Sternaman offered a share of the team to Paddy Driscoll, but the move was blocked by the owners in the NFL&#x27;s June meeting, after the Chicago Cardinals (Driscoll&#x27;s team) activated the league&#x27;s reserve clause.

In 1931, Sternaman offered to sell his stake to Halas for $38,000 to focus on his other businesses. Halas’ purchase agreement with Sternaman was to be paid off in installments, and stipulated that if Halas defaulted on any of the payments, ownership of the team reverted to Sternaman. Halas raised the initial funding by selling an 8.33% ownership stake to Ralph Brizzolara, as well as $5,000 of shares to Jim McMillen, and George Trafton&#x27;s mother, who paid $20,000 (Halas later bought her out for $40,000). Charles Bidwill purchased $5,000 in stock in 1933 (which was later bought off of his widow Violet for $50,000 in 1949) and he also arranged a bank loan for the remaining $5,000 needed to pay off Sternaman:

Halas remained the club&#x27;s president and principal owner until his death on October 31, 1983.

Halas&#x27; children, George &quot;Mugs&quot; Halas Jr. and Virginia McCaskey acquired stock in the team through prior gifts and sales. After Mugs&#x27; death in 1979, Halas Sr. owned a 49.35% interest in the Bears, Mugs&#x27; estate owned a 19.67% interest, while Virginia McCaskey, Jim Finks (3.5%, which he later relinquished when he resigned as the team GM), Charles Brizzolara, Robert and Carol Brizzolara in joint tenancy, and Nancy Lorenz owned the remaining outstanding shares. In 1981, the shareholders merged the Bears with a newly formed Delaware-incorporated organization, the Chicago Bears Football Club, Inc..

In 1987, Mugs&#x27; estate executor wanted to sell his ownership stake and challenged the legality of a 1981 corporate reorganization and the other owners&#x27; right of first refusal, while his heirs, Christine and Stephen Halas, wanted to keep their father&#x27;s stake, asking a Cook County Probate Court judge not to allow the sale. Ultimately they failed to block the Chicago Bears from buying their father&#x27;s 19.67% ownership stake of the team, which sold for $17.5 million in 1988. Bears then-president Michael McCaskey called the purchase a &quot;terrific financial burden&quot;, and the team would later sell the stake to Chicago-area businessmen Andrew McKenna and Patrick Ryan for a then-undisclosed sum in 1990. At the time it was also speculated that they invested to help the Bears lobby lawmakers for a domed stadium. In 2017, the NFL approved a sale of shares from Mugs&#x27; children (unreported whom or how much) to the McCaskey family for an undisclosed sum.

On February 6, 2025, Virginia McCaskey died at the age of 102.

==Sponsorships==
The team has major sponsorship deals with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Miller Brewing Company, PNC Financial Services, United Airlines, Verizon, Xfinity, and Proven IT. The team was the first in the NFL to have a presenting sponsor, with the 2004 season advertised as &quot;Bears Football presented by BankOne&quot;. Additionally, the Bears have an agreement with WFLD (the Fox owned-and-operated station in Chicago) to broadcast pre-season football games.

==Logos and uniforms==
The club has had few official logos throughout their history. When the team was known as the Decatur Staleys in 1920, they used A. E. Staley&#x27;s logo as football was intended to help promote the company. The first Chicago Bears logo was introduced in 1940, depicting a black bear running with a football. The next logo, introduced in 1946, featured a navy blue bear on top of a football.

In 1962, the Bears introduced their trademark &quot;wishbone-C&quot; logo for the first time. Initially white with a black outline, the logo is similar to the &quot;C&quot; long worn on the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; baseball caps, and very closely resembles the University of Chicago Maroons&#x27; &quot;C&quot; logo introduced in 1898. The change in the Bears&#x27; logo was due to the addition of logos on helmets, which professional football teams began adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In 2023, the Bears made their primary logo the orange bear head, which was previously their secondary logo since 1999. Despite demoting the &quot;C&quot; to a secondary logo, the team will still retain it on their helmets and at the home field&#x27;s 50-yard line.

==Team culture==
===Mascots and cheerleaders===
Before the 2003 season, the team had two unofficial mascots named &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Bearman&quot;. &quot;Rocky&quot; was a man who donned a #1 Bears jersey, carried a megaphone, and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, in a fashion similar to Fireman Ed. The identity of &quot;Rocky&quot; is unknown, but he presumably lives in northwestern Indiana. Don Wachter, also known as &quot;Bearman&quot;, is a season ticket holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading, similar to Rocky. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score (a role more recently done by the Bears 4th Phase and Bears captains). In 1996, he donned his &quot;costume&quot; of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number 46 jersey. &quot;Bearman&quot; was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of Staley Da Bear in 2003, but in 2005 Wachter was allowed in costume again.

Staley Da Bear is an anthropomorphic bear with a customized No. 00 jersey, with blue and orange eyes, synonymous with the team&#x27;s main colors. His name is eponymous to starch processing company A. E. Staley, who founded the Bears&#x27; franchise. Like Rocky and Bearman, he entertains Bears fans, but like other NFL mascots, and mascots in general, Staley also visits charity events, parties, Chicago Rush AFL games, and other Bears-related events, as well as taking part in games with his &quot;furballs&quot; against youth football teams at halftime.

The team had a cheerleading squad called the Chicago Honey Bears beginning in 1976. However, Bears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey terminated them after the 1985 season. The squad&#x27;s uniforms changed three times: from 1976 to 1979, the uniform was a white bodysuit with navy blue sleeves; from 1980 to 1984 it was a white bodysuit with orange sleeves and the navy was moved to the trim, and for the squad&#x27;s final season in 1985, the uniform was redesigned with an orange sequin vest.

===Philanthropy===
Since 1998, the Bears have partnered with &#x27;A Safe Place,&#x27; a domestic violence shelter in Waukegan, Illinois. In June 2017, existing and former Bears employees helped renovate the shelter by ripping up carpet, painting walls, demolishing a kitchen and building a fence. The Bears have also provided financial support throughout the years.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
====Green Bay Packers====

The Green Bay Packers are the Bears&#x27; biggest rivals since their team&#x27;s inception in 1920. The Green Bay Packers currently have the lead at 103–95–6, and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams&#x27; first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other. The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.

====Detroit Lions====

The Detroit Lions and Bears have faced off since the Lions&#x27; inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, with the Spartans winning, 7–6, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 14–6. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 99–74–5. The rivalry grew in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first-ever postseason game in NFL history, with the Bears winning the game 9–0. The game also was known as the first pro &quot;indoor football&quot; game, as the game took place in indoor Chicago Stadium due to a blizzard at the time. The game also started the forward pass.

====Minnesota Vikings====

Chicago and Minnesota took each other on in the Vikings&#x27; inaugural game, with the Vikings defeating the Bears in a 37–13 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the series lead 60–54–2.

===Historic===
====Chicago/St. Louis/Arizona Cardinals====

The oldest continuing matchup in the NFL belongs to the Bears and the Arizona Cardinals, the only remaining NFL teams from the 1920 APFA season. It began as intense intra-city rivalry between the Bears and the Chicago Cardinals, which the Bears were leading 47–19–6 through 1959, when the Cardinals moved to St. Louis. The rivalry&#x27;s importance waned further after the Cardinals moved to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1988. The Bears lead the all-time series 59–28–6. The teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.

====New York Giants====

The Bears and the New York Giants squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common match-up in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. The Bears won four of the six championship games, which included the Sneakers Game that the Giants won in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). As of the 2023 season, the Bears lead the all-time series 36–25–2.

====San Francisco 49ers====
The Bears and San Francisco 49ers were regular foes while both played in the Western Conference. The rivalry grew during the 1980s, as both teams were constant playoff contenders in the NFC. The 49ers currently hold the series lead 35–33–1 and 3–0 in the playoffs. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and 49ers play at least once every four years.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====
The Bears holds historic rivalry with its former NFC Central foe Tampa Bay Buccaneers. as of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 40–22. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Bucs play at least once every four years.

====Washington Commanders====
Although the teams never played in the same division, the Bears and the Washington Commanders have a historically significant rivalry, dating back to 1932, when the Commanders were located in Boston and were known as the Braves. The rivalry started to heat up in 1937, when Washington drafted quarterback Sammy Baugh and both teams were often met in the NFL Championship Game. The most memorable game from that era was in 1940, when the Bears set a record by defeating the Commanders 73-0 in the NFL Championship game, to this day, the largest margin of victory in league history. The series regained steam in the 1980s, when both teams were fighting for the NFC supremacy. Washington holds a slight edge in the all-time series 27-25-1 (2–1 in the playoffs and 2–2 in championship games). Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Commanders play at least once every four years.

===Minor===

====Cleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams====
The Cleveland/Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams and the Bears played in the same division the 1937 NFL season to the 1969 NFL season (with the 1958 game attracting 100,470 fans, the largest in Bears history), while the two franchises continue to play annually until the 1980 NFL season. From 1995 to 2015 the two teams were part of the Chicago-St. Louis rivalries in the major professional leagues. As of the 2023 season, Chicago currently holds the series lead 54–39–3 (1–1 in the playoffs). It is the Rams&#x27; longest-running, non-division series. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the Bears and Rams play at least once every four years.

====Miami Dolphins====
The AFC member Miami Dolphins and the Bears met less than 15 times but most of them were memorable. The most notable was the 1985 shootout at Monday Night, as Miami handing Chicago their first, and only, regular-season loss for the year, while keeping the 1972 Dolphins as the only perfect team in NFL history. As of the 2023 season, Miami currently holds the series lead 10–4. Under the current NFL scheduling formula, the teams play at least once every four years.

===Defunct===
====Rock Island Independents====
Chicago had a fierce instate rivalry with the Rock Island Independents in the league&#x27;s first decade, with the Bears winning the series 8–1–4.

==== Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs ====
The Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs and the Staleys/Bears rivalry was between the two NFL&#x27;s powerhouses in the 1920s, with games usually attracting the most fans, and the outcome often decided the fate of NFL Championship (1921–1924). The rivalry grow after the 1921 season, when the Staleys star Guy Chamberlin joined the Bulldogs and led them to three consecutive championships, including a tiebreaker win over the Bears in 1924. Chicago won the series 4–3.

==Facilities==
===Stadium===
Soldier Field, located on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, is the home of the Bears. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing Wrigley Field, the team&#x27;s home for 50 years. After the AFL-NFL Merger, the league preferred their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with portable bleachers that the team set up at Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000. At first, the Bears were supposed to play at Dyche Stadium (later called Ryan Field), but Northwestern University&#x27;s residential neighbors objected, and the agreement was cancelled. The original home of the Bears was Staley Field at Decatur, Illinois, when the team was known as the Decatur Staleys, before they moved to Chicago in 1921.

Soldier Field&#x27;s playing surface was changed from natural grass to astroturf before the 1971 season, and then back to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. Throughout its history, Soldier Field&#x27;s field maintenance has been done by the Chicago Park District (the municipal entity from which the Bears lease the field) by disparate district employees, rather than a permanent team-employed grounds crew, generating some controversy among players for its rough surface. This arrangement caused disagreements with the city throughout the years, with the Bears attempting to agree on a new stadium since 1986. The stadium was the site of the infamous Fog Bowl playoff game between the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles.

In 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, the day after the Bears lost in the playoffs. It reopened on September 27, 2003, after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium&#x27;s history). Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as &quot;New Soldier Field&quot;. During the season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois&#x27; Memorial Stadium in Champaign, where they went 3–5.

Multiple critics have negative views of the new stadium, believing that its structure has made it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the &quot;Mistake on the Lake&quot;. Soldier Field was stripped of its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.

In the 2005 season, the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006, against the Carolina Panthers. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since the stadium reopened.

The stadium&#x27;s end zones and midfield were unpainted until the 1982 season. The design sported on the field included the bolded word &quot;Chicago&quot; rendered in Highway Gothic in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, with the addition of a large wishbone &quot;C&quot; Bears logo painted at midfield. These field markings remained unchanged until the 1996 season. In 1996 the midfield wishbone &quot;C&quot; was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the end zone design were painted with &quot;Bears&quot; in cursive. This design remained until the 1999 season, when the artwork was returned to the classic &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked with the word &quot;Chicago&quot; bolded in one end zone and the other having &quot;Bears&quot;.

In June 2021, the Bears submitted a bid to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights, Illinois from Churchill Downs. Despite negotiations between the city of Chicago to upgrade Soldier Field again, the Bears entered into an agreement with Churchill Downs to purchase the Arlington International Racecourse in September 2021 for $197.2 million. The sale of the property which includes 326 acres of space for potential development closed on February 15, 2023. As of 2024, the Bears have shifted their focus to the parking area south of Soldier Field on Museum Campus. On April 24, 2024, the Bears revealed plans for a $4.7 billion domed lakefront stadium development.

===Training camp locations===
From its inception until 1930 the Staleys/Bears conducted their summer training camp in their home stadiums: Staley Field (Decatur, Illinois) and later Cubs&#x27; Park (Chicago). In 1930 they first moved to Mills Stadium in Chicago and from 1931 to 1934 to Loyola University Chicago, Logan Square Baseball Park, Notre Dame University and Lane Tech College Prep High School, respectively. In 1935 they began to conduct training camps at a prominent location, when they started practicing at St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Military Academy (Delafield, Wisconsin) for a decade.

In 1944 they moved to St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Rensselaer, Indiana and stayed there for 30 years. This location was the place of the famous automobile accident on July 27, 1964 that killed Bears players Willie Galimore and Bo Farrington, after Galimore&#x27;s Volkswagen left the road on a curve and rolled, a few miles from the team&#x27;s training camp.

From 1975 to 1984 they conducted their summer training camp in Lake Forest College, at the original Halas Hall (the practice and front office facility for the Bears from 1977 until 1997). The practice field was later renamed Farwell Field and serves as the main field for Foresters football and soccer.

From 1984 to 2001, the Bears held pre-season training camp in Ralph E. Davis Pioneer Stadium at University of Wisconsin–Platteville. They were considered a member of the &quot;Cheese League&quot; that in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin. In 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility in order to raise funds for remodeling Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 to UW–Platteville for a new computer lab, which was named &quot;The Bears Den&quot;. On June 16, 2014, the stadium was damaged by a tornado and the Bears donated $50,000 to the school relief fund.

From 2002 to 2019, the Bears held their summer training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. Although the Bears had an agreement to continue practicing there through 2022, they moved the camp permanently into the recently renovated Halas Hall in 2020.
===Headquarters===

The team headquarters, Halas Hall, named after founder George Halas, is in the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities during the season. The location is west of the original Halas Hall which had opened in 1977, and it was named after George Halas Jr., who died unexpectedly in 1979. It was located at Lake Forest College and contained 2 practice fields (one regulation-size outdoor field as well as a 70-yard practice field) and front office facilities, which is used by the Foresters Athletics Department. The 38-acre complex opened on March 3, 1997, and was expanded in 2013 and 2018.

The team also has a corporate office in downtown Chicago, located at 123 N. Wacker Dr, for sales, corporate partnerships and events departments employees.

==In popular culture==

While the Super Bowl XX champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; starring Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers and James Caan as Brian Piccolo. The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league&#x27;s best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through Brian&#x27;s fatal illness. A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred Sean Maher as Piccolo and Mekhi Phifer as Sayers.

The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;, which reached number forty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award. The music video for the song depicts the team rapping that they are &quot;not here to start no trouble&quot; but instead &quot;just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;. The team took a risk by recording and releasing the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46–10. That game was one of the most-watched television events in history according to the Nielsen ratings system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it seventh in all-time television history.

In addition to the &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; rap song, the Bears&#x27; success in the 1980s – and especially the personality of head coach Mike Ditka – inspired a recurring sketch on the American sketch comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, called &quot;Bill Swerski&#x27;s Superfans&quot;. The sketch featured &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star George Wendt, a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to WGN radio&#x27;s &quot;The Sportswriters&quot;), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski (Robert Smigel), Pat Arnold (Mike Myers) and Todd O&#x27;Connor (Chris Farley). To hear them tell it, &quot;Da Bears&quot; and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists chugging beer and eating lots of Polish sausage, and often featured Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered CPR). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout victories for Bears games. Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought back by &quot;SNL&quot;, with the exception of a single appearance by Horatio Sanz as a Super Fan for the Cubs on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; in 2003. Outside of &quot;SNL&quot;, George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of Super Bowl XL on ABC.

On TV shows based in Chicago such as &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Still Standing&quot;, &quot;According to Jim&quot;, &quot;Early Edition&quot; and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, the main characters are all Bears fans, and have worn Bears&#x27; jerseys and T-shirts on some occasions. Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. &quot;Roseanne&quot; is another TV show based in Illinois (albeit not in Chicago itself) to feature the Bears as the consensus household favorite, as &#x27;Dan Connor&#x27; John Goodman is seen wearing Bears hats in several episodes. &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; featured several Bears references, as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans. In an episode of the Disney Channel show &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, based in Chicago, recurring character Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) sold scalped Chicago Bears tickets. More recently, &quot;Modern Family&quot; character Cameron Tucker has been shown as a Bears fan. In an episode of the Disney Channel show &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Do It&quot;, based in Chicago, Lindy Watson (Olivia Holt) and Logan Watson (Austin North) try to get a football signed by NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus after destroying their fathers Butkus signed ball, Alshon Jeffery also makes a cameo appearance as well.

Ditka&#x27;s success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the &quot;NFL on NBC&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, and he currently works on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on WBBM-TV&#x27;s &quot;2 on Football&quot; with former WBBM-TV sports director Mark Malone. He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor Will Ferrell in the 2005 comedy film &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;.

Also, Ditka, Dick Butkus, Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, William &quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry and Brian Urlacher are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league&#x27;s best-selling in 2002, was featured on Nike commercials with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick.

In the 1961 Hanna-Barbera animated short &quot;Rah Rah Bear&quot;, Yogi Bear helps the Bears beat the New York Giants.
The Bears were later depicted in an episode of the 1985 cartoon version of the NBC sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, where the Bears are playing the Green Bay Packers.

Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) from the &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation series&quot; appears in some scenes wearing a navy blue with burnt orange scripting Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout all four &quot;Vacation&quot; movies.

==Broadcast media==
===Radio===

Currently, WMVP (1000 AM) broadcast Bears games with Jeff Joniak doing the play-by-play, along with color commentator Tom Thayer, who played for the Bears from 1985 to 1992. Over the years, many Bears play-by-play broadcasters have included play-by-play announcers Jack Brickhouse, Joe McConnell and Wayne Larrivee, and color commentators Hub Arkush, Dick Butkus, Jim Hart and Irv Kupcinet.

Spanish radio station WLEY-FM aired the Bears games from 2012 to 2014. Since 2015, WRTO and WVIV-FM air Bears games in Spanish.

===Television===
Preseason games air on WFLD (channel 32). The announcers are Adam Amin (play-by-play), Jim Miller (color commentary) and Lou Canellis (sideline reporter). WFLD also carries the majority of the team&#x27;s regular season games through the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;. Any Bears home games against AFC teams are aired on the CBS O&amp;O station, WBBM-TV, which was the Bears&#x27; unofficial &quot;home&quot; station from 1956 until Fox won the NFC rights in 1995. Sunday Night games are broadcast on WMAQ-TV, the NBC O&amp;O station, with &quot;ESPN Monday Night Football&quot; games airing either on ESPN or WLS-TV, the ABC affiliate.

==Statistics and records==
Patrick Mannelly holds the record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 16. On the other hand, Steve McMichael holds the record for most consecutive games played by a Bear with 191; he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one game in a span of 13 seasons.

Kicker Robbie Gould became the Bears&#x27; all-time scoring leader in Week 5 of 2015 season overtaking placekicker Kevin Butler who previously held the club record for scoring the most points in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back Walter Payton, with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726. That was an NFL record until Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in . Former Bears running back Matt Forte, who started playing for the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton&#x27;s record with 6,985 yards. Forte also holds the team&#x27;s single season record for rookies in rushing attempts, rushing yards and receptions. Mark Bortz holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, Dennis Gentry, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Steve McMichael, Ron Rivera, Mike Singletary, and Keith Van Horne, who have each played in 12 playoff games.

The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game, including both playoff and regular season games, with a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship Game. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942; unlike the 1972 Miami Dolphins, however, they did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger. Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324. Halas&#x27; victories record stood until Don Shula surpassed Halas in . Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.

During the 2006 season, return specialist Devin Hester set several kick return records. He currently holds the franchise record for most return yards with 2,261. He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for most returns in a single season. In 2007, he recorded another six touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard touchdown. The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher&#x27;s previous record, which was set almost a year earlier. Hester set a Super Bowl record as the first player to return an opening kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown. On December 20, 2010, Hester set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers.

In 2012, Charles Tillman set the record for most forced fumbles in a single game with four against the Tennessee Titans. Against the Titans, Chicago became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception return for a touchdown, and a blocked kick/punt for a score in the same quarter. Tillman and teammate Lance Briggs became the first pair in NFL history to return an interception for a touchdown in consecutive games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys.

==Players of note==
===Current roster===
===Pro Football Hall of Famers===

In the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Bears have the most enshrined primary members with 32; the club also has had nine Hall of Famers spend a minor portion of their career with the franchise. Founder, owner, head coach, and player George Halas, halfback Bronko Nagurski, and Red Grange were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963. The franchise saw 14 individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame from 1963 to 1967. The most recent Bears to be inducted were Devin Hester and Steve McMichael in 2024 (primary contributors) and Jared Allen (minor contributor) in 2025.

In addition, Ray Bray was enshrined in Helms Athletic Foundation Pro Football Hall of Fame, which was established in 1950 and preceded the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He&#x27;s the only Bears member from the Helms Athletic Foundation hall to not be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame===

The Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1979 and honors sports greats associated with the Chicago metropolitan area. As of 2023, there are 59 honorees enshrined in the hall with connection to the Bears.

===Retired numbers===
The Bears have retired 14 uniform numbers, which is the most in the NFL, and ranks fourth behind the basketball Boston Celtics (23), baseball New York Yankees (21), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Bears retired Mike Ditka&#x27;s number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013. It is the last number that the Bears retired.

===Top 100 greatest Bears of all-time===
In honor of the team&#x27;s centennial anniversary, on May 20, 2019, the Chicago Bears unveiled the Top 100 players in franchise history, as voted on by Hall of Fame writers Don Pierson and Dan Pompei, two of the most famous journalists that have ever covered the club in their long history. At the time of the publish, the list included 27 Pro Football Hall of Famers, while two more inductees would join in the 2020 Centennial class (Jim Covert and Ed Sprinkle).

Among the 100 Greatest, four active players made the list, including safety Eddie Jackson (96), defensive lineman Akiem Hicks (75), offensive lineman Kyle Long (74) and Khalil Mack (60), who had only played only one season with the team at the time of the unveiling of the list. Long would retire the following year.

On a later date, Chicagobears.com released a list titled &quot;Top 10: Best of the rest&quot; that featured the &quot;top 10 snubs&quot; from the centennial list. The players include (in a following order): Alex Brown, Thomas Jones, Dave Whitsell, Curtis Conway, Tim Jennings, Leslie Frazier, Roberto Garza, Marty Booker, Nathan Vasher and William Perry. Pompei would later say that the last two players who didn&#x27;t make the list were Brown and Frazier.

==Coaching staff==

==Minor league affiliates==
The NFL, contrary to the four other major sports leagues in North America, don&#x27;t have a formal farm system (beside the short lived Association of Professional Football Leagues), and over the years some teams had &quot;independent&quot; minor affiliates throughout their existence. The Bears, along with the New York Giants, were at the forefront of those endeavors when in 1939 Halas purchased the American Association&#x27;s Newark Tornadoes and renamed them the &quot;Bears&quot;. Halas stocked the team with talent that did not make the Chicago roster, and used the club to incubate talent and for easy return for injured players, thus making it pro football&#x27;s first true farm team. Newark&#x27;s most notable names included Joe Zeller as coach and Gene Ronzani (that year Chicago also assigned Sid Luckman to Newark playoff game, which the Bears won 13–6, to win the Southern Division title). This practice continued sporadically until 1972, and ended with the collapse of several minor leagues along with the NFL labor disputes in the 1970s.

Other notable players assigned includes: George Gulyanics, Ed Ecker, Lloyd Reese, Raymond Schumacher, Jack Karwales and Doug McEnulty.

<doc id="6612" wikidata="Q223511" url="?curid=6612" title="Cincinnati Bengals">
<text>The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.

Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati&#x27;s city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season. Brown was the Bengals&#x27; head coach from their inception to . 

After being dismissed as the Browns&#x27; head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in ) in January , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season. 

After Paul Brown&#x27;s death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.

The Bengals won the AFC championship in , , and in . After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as &quot;The Bungles,&quot; a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope. Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. 

The team&#x27;s fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs. The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20. They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23–20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).

The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is the Bengals’ “de facto general manager” because he handles most personnel decisions. In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports. 

In a &quot;Forbes&quot; article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.

==History==
=== Brown family era (1968–present) ===
In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order &quot;to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati&quot;. Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues from 1937 to 1942. The city&#x27;s world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger.

In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word &quot;BENGALS&quot; in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width. The Bengals began play in the 1968 season.

In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League. Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams.

For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.

Prior to the merger&#x27;s announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that &quot;I didn&#x27;t pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.&quot; However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970.

There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park.

While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location.

With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium.

With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown&#x27;s rivalry with Art Modell.

==== Paul Brown and Bill Johnson years (1968–1978) ====
For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.

Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown&#x27;s college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals&#x27; roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.

In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too. The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.

==== Forrest Gregg/Sam Wyche years (1980–1991) ====
The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times. The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.

Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82. Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team. The Bengals&#x27; fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts.

==== Marvin Lewis years (2003–2018) ====
The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003. Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year). Despite Kitna&#x27;s success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season. The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004. Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Round to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.
The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise&#x27;s first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.

Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL. He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.

The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot. Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round. In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982. However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.

In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record. But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10. Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs. This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons.

In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns. Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark. Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games. This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals&#x27; starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.

Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals&#x27; head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9. The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.

The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes, A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals&#x27; first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season. The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North. On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.

==== Zac Taylor years (2019–present) ====

In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor. The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster. The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati. They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft. They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team&#x27;s worst record in history.

In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins. Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans. Finishing the season 4–11–1.

In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens. Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow&#x27;s college teammate at LSU, Ja&#x27;Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round. After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.

In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs. They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard. Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history. Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game. 

In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season. The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow&#x27;s injury. The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.

The 2024 season, with Burrow returning, came with high expectations for the Bengals; however, Cincinnati limped to a 4–8 start to the season thanks primarily to a porous defense; the Bengals lost four games where they scored at least 33 points; an NFL record. The team finished strong, winning their final five games to finish with a 9–8 record for the second straight season, however, they missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Burrow led the NFL in passing yards; wide receiver Ja&#x27;Marr Chase won the triple crown leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, and defensive end Trey Hendrickson led the league in sacks.

==Logos and uniforms==

When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals&#x27; uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns&#x27; team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest.

The Bengals&#x27; team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word &quot;Bengals&quot; in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called &quot;TV numbers&quot;) until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn&#x27;t have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; likened the Bengals&#x27; new helmets to &quot;varicose pumpkins.&quot;
In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal&#x27;s head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders. A new logo consisting of an orange &quot;B&quot; covered with black tiger stripes was introduced. The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor.

In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player&#x27;s name.

The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season. The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player&#x27;s name. This set also puts the team&#x27;s wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.

In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the &quot;one-helmet rule,&quot; the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets. This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.

In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot; leaked the option to the public. The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.

==Mascots==
The team&#x27;s official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey. Its jersey number is 1. Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team&#x27;s cheerleading squad, which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.

Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, &quot;In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.&quot;

The Ohio History Central notes: &quot;In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.&quot;

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
==== Cleveland Browns ====

The Bengals&#x27; historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the &quot;Battle of Ohio&quot;, started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns. The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals&#x27; original uniforms were identical to the Browns&#x27; uniforms, excluding the word &quot;Bengals&quot; on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown&#x27;s sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals. The Bengals lead the series 55–48 as of the end of the 2024 season.

==== Pittsburgh Steelers ====

The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs. The Steelers lead the overall series 71–40 and the postseason series 2–0. However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer, while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.

==== Baltimore Ravens ====

The Bengals&#x27; rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 32–27 as of the 2024 season. The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.

===Conference===
==== Kansas City Chiefs ====
The Bengals rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs became a notable rivalry in the AFC Conference starting in 2021 when the Bengals led by Quarterback Joe Burrow led the Bengals to three straight victories(two regular season, one playoffs) over the Chiefs team, led by Quarterback Patrick Mahomes which had become dominant in the NFL. The playoff victory was in the 2022 AFC Conference Title Game in the Chiefs Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, making Burrow only the 2nd Quarterback to beat the Mahomes-Led Chiefs in the Playoffs. After the Burrow-led Bengals won their 2nd regular season game against the Mahomes-Led Chiefs in the 2022 NFL Regular Season, the Chiefs would start a current three game winning streak against the Burrow-led Bengals beginning with a victory in the 2023 AFC Conference Title Matchup. The Chiefs would in the 2023 Regular Season when Burrow was injured and in the 2024 Regular Season by a score of 26-25, after a late controversial pass-interference penalty on a 4th down against the Bengals, allowing the Chiefs to kick a game winning field goal. The Bengals currently lead the overall series against the Chiefs, 18-17.

==Contributions to NFL culture==

===No-huddle offense===
A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team&#x27;s defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made.
The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the &quot;no-huddle&quot; in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the &quot;no-huddle&quot; illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals&#x27; team just two hours before the game kickoff. Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the &quot;no-huddle&quot; would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players&#x27; fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the &quot;no-huddle&quot; in 1984. Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect.

===West Coast offense===
The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh. Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh&#x27;s system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971. Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati&#x27;s starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson&#x27;s 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson&#x27;s 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the &quot;old&quot; game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack. The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the &quot;team franchise&quot; by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.

===Zone blitz===
The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team&#x27;s head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.

==Culture==
===Fight song===
&quot;The Bengal Growl&quot; is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George &quot;Red&quot; Bird upon the team&#x27;s founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns&#x27; music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns&#x27; fight song, &quot;Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!&quot; The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at &quot;Bengals backer&quot; bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team&#x27;s head of strategy and fan engagement, told &quot;The Athletic&quot; recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team&#x27;s image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; is also a fight song for the Bengals. The song is mainly played before kickoffs to intimidate visiting teams.

===Who Dey Chant===

&quot;Who Dey?!&quot; is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: &quot;Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?&quot; The answer screamed in unison, &quot;Nobody.&quot; Sometimes fans will instead shout &quot;Who Dey?&quot; to represent the entire cheer. &quot;Who Dey&quot; is also the name of the team&#x27;s mascot, a Bengal tiger.

Saying &quot;Who Dey&quot; at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the &quot;Who Dey&quot; chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out &quot;If Hudy&quot;, &quot;Burger&quot; and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.

The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals. While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: &quot;Who&#x27;s going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!&quot; Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.

The chant bears some similarities to the phrase &quot;Who Dat?&quot;, which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana&#x27;s high school team fans for some time. The saying &quot;Who Dat?&quot; originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: &quot;Who dat talking &#x27;bout beating dem Jags?&quot;

<doc id="6613" wikidata="Q5413" url="?curid=6613" title="Yangtze">
<text>The Yangtze or Yangzi ( or ) is the longest river in Eurasia and the third-longest in the world. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea. It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country&#x27;s population.

The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China&#x27;s GDP, and the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use. In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports to create a new economic belt alongside the river.

The Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species, including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or &quot;baiji&quot;) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution, agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
===Chinese===
 () or &quot;Long River&quot; is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to the upstream sections of the river up to its confluence with the Min River at Yibin, Sichuan. Jinsha River (&quot;Gold Sands River&quot;) refers to the of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian River (&quot;River that leads to Heaven&quot;) describes the section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.

In Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called &quot;Jiang/Kiang&quot; , a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical with the homophone (now pronounced , but &quot;*kˤoŋ&quot; in Old Chinese). &quot;Kong&quot; was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to &quot;*krong&quot; in Proto-Vietnamese and &quot;krung&quot; in Mon, all meaning &quot;river&quot;, it is related to modern Vietnamese &quot;sông&quot; (river) and Khmer &quot;krung&quot; (city on riverside), whence Thai &quot;krung&quot; (กรุง capital city), not &quot;kôngkea&quot; (water) which is from the Sanskrit root &quot;gáṅgā&quot;.
By the Han dynasty, had come to mean &quot;any&quot; river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the &quot;Great River&quot; (). The epithet (simplified version ), meaning &quot;long&quot;, was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.

Various sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the () or &quot;Sichuan River&quot;. In Hubei, the river is also called the () or the &quot;Jing River&quot; after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name after the shorthand name for Anhui, (皖). () or the &quot;Yangzi River&quot;, from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called or (). Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river. The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).

===English===

The river was called Quian () and Quianshui () by Marco Polo and appeared on the earliest English maps as Kian or Kiam, all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of as &quot;Kæwng&quot;. By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as Kiang; &quot;Dajiang&quot;, e.g., was rendered as &quot;Ta-Kiang.&quot; &quot;Keeang-Koo,&quot; &quot;Kyang Kew,&quot; &quot;Kian-ku,&quot; and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (,  &quot;Jiāngkǒu&quot;) as the name of the river itself.

The name Blue River began to be applied in the 18th century, apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a &#x27;translation&#x27; of &quot;Jiang&quot;, &quot;Jiangkou&quot;, or &quot;Yangzijiang&quot;. Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river&#x27;s Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.

Matteo Ricci&#x27;s 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the &quot;Ianſu&quot; and &quot;Ianſuchian.&quot; The posthumous account&#x27;s translation of the name as Fils de la Mer (&quot;Son of the Ocean&quot;) shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic rather than the usual . Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, Yangzhou was the lower river&#x27;s principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang&#x27;s important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River&#x27;s principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.)

By 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name as Yang-tse or Yang-tse Kiang. The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to Yang-tzu Chiang as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing&#x27;s and first published in 1867. The spellings Yangtze and Yangtze Kiang was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC&#x27;s First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling Yangzi has also been used.

===Tibetan===

The source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai. In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the &quot;Machu&quot; (, lit. &quot;Red Water&quot;). The Tongtian is the &quot;Drichu&quot; (, ‘Bri Chu’), literally &quot;Water of the Female Yak&quot;; transliterated into ).

==Geography==

The river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, two of which are commonly referred to as the &quot;source.&quot; Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains. This source is found at and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately southeast of Geladandong. This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at and above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai. As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.

These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river&#x27;s elevation drops from above to less than . Thus, over the first of its length, the river has fallen more than .

It enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several large tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.

After entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.

At the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.

Four of China&#x27;s five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.

The origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45 million years ago in the Eocene, but this dating has been disputed.

== History ==

=== Geologic history ===
Although the mouth of the Yellow River has fluctuated widely north and south of the Shandong peninsula within the historical record, the Yangtze has remained largely static. Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene ( Ma). Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.
=== Early history ===
The Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan. Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago, and by the 5th millennium BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain. What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the &quot;Yue&quot; people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves and were considered barbarous by the northerners.

The Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures. Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).
In the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the &quot;Gouwu&quot; in southern Jiangsu and the &quot;Yuyue&quot; in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century BC. Traditional accounts credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.

Whether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period&#x27;s Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States&#x27; Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu&#x27;s growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu&#x27;s capital Ying in 506 BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu&#x27;s southern flank. In 473 BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333 BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu&#x27;s settlements along the river.

The state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, the previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Xiang River to expand into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.

Since the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China&#x27;s economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods. By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided – of the nation&#x27;s revenues.

The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China&#x27;s inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.

Historically, the Yangtze was the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because crossing the river was difficult. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.

The Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin–Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin. The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year.

Politically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911–12, 1927–37, and 1945–49.

=== Age of steam ===
The &quot;Jardine&quot;, the first steamship to sail the river, was built for Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. in 1835. This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a &quot;fire-ship&quot; steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip. On the &quot;Jardine&#x27;s&quot; first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The &quot;Jardine&quot; in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.&lt;br&gt;Subsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the &quot;suggestions&quot; of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the &quot;Royal Saxon&quot;, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.

The China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.


===Navigation on the upper river===

Steamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a &quot;150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,&quot; posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70–80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.

Archibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built &quot;Kuling&quot; but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their craft caused by steamship wakes. &quot;Kuling&quot; was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native craft.

In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built &quot;Leechuan&quot;, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March &quot;Leechuan&quot; completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. &quot;Leechuan&quot; was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.

In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia&#x27;s Upper Karun River and took up Little&#x27;s offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on &quot;Leechuan&quot; at the end of 1898. With Plant&#x27;s design input, Little had SS &quot;Pioneer&quot; built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS &quot;Kinsha&quot;. Germany&#x27;s steamship effort that same year on SS &quot;Suixing&quot; ended in catastrophe. On &quot;Suixing&#x27;s&quot; maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.

In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS &quot;Shutung&quot; and SS &quot;Shuhun&quot;. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.

He also wrote &quot;Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River&quot;, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze&#x27;s currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. &quot;Shutung&quot; was commandeered by warlords and &quot;Shuhun&quot; was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.

In 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant&#x27;s name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant&#x27;s home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.

Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.

===Contemporary events===
Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.

In 2002, Danish adventurer and sailor Troels Kløvedal sailed up the Yangtze, from Shanghai to past the Three Gorges Dam, in the collectively owned &quot;Nordkaperen&quot; sailing ship. Kløvedal had spent 12 years preparing and gathering the required permissions, and with a crew of Danes, his family members, a Chinese interpreter and several local maritime pilots, he became the first foreigner since 1949 to navigate the Yangtze. His months-long journey was documented both in his 2004 book &quot;Kineserne syr med lang tråd&quot; and the TV show &quot;Kløvedal i Kina&quot; by DR.

In August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.

==Hydrology==

===Periodic floods===

Tens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.

The 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7 million and 4 million. The Yangtze flooded again in 1935, causing great loss of life.

From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.

The 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.

In the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26 billion in economic loss. Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180 million people were affected. A staggering were evacuated, 13.3 million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26 billion in damages.

The 2016 China floods caused US$22 billion in damages.

In 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect – a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.

===Degradation of the river===

Beginning in the 1950s, dams and dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation, and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from in the 1950s to in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable &quot;iron barrier&quot; that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.

In 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.

=== Contribution to ocean pollution ===
The Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. Ten rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, with the Yangtze River being the biggest polluter.

=== Reconnecting lakes ===
In 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian&#x27;e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005, Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.

Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea. In 2006 China&#x27;s Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering . As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and . The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3 billion creating China&#x27;s largest urban wetland landscape.

==Crossings==
Until 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the &quot;Zhong&#x27;anlun&quot; disaster (October 15, 1945).

The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).

Bridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008). The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.

A number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.

==Dams==
As of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Baihetan Dam is the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam, and the Xiluodu Dam is the 4th largest power station in the world.

==Tributaries==
The Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:
* Yalong River (Panzhihua, Sichuan)
* Min River (Yibin, Sichuan)
* Tuo River (Luzhou, Sichuan)
* Chishui River (Hejiang, Sichuan)
* Jialing River (Chongqing)
* Wu River (Fuling, Chongqing)
* Qing River (Yidu, Hubei)
* Yuan River (via Dongting Lake)
* Lishui River (via Dongting Lake)
* Zi River (via Dongting Lake)
* Xiang River (Yueyang, Hunan)
* Han River (Wuhan, Hubei)
* Gan River (near Jiujiang, Jiangxi)
* Shuiyang River (Dangtu, Anhui)
* Qingyi River (Wuhu, Anhui)
* Chao Lake water system (Chaohu, Anhui)
* Lake Tai water system (Shanghai)
The Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.

==Wildlife==

The Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.

===Fish===

, 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river&#x27;s estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160). 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above , are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river. The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.

Many Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list. Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, &quot;Anabarilius liui liui&quot; and &quot;Atrilinea macrolepis&quot;), two that are extinct in the wild (&quot;Anabarilius polylepis&quot;, &quot;Schizothorax parvus&quot;), four that are critically endangered &quot;Euchiloglanis kishinouyei&quot;, &quot;Megalobrama elongata&quot;, &quot;Schizothorax longibarbus&quot; and &quot;Leiocassis longibarbus&quot;). Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens. Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct. Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged. The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of ; the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as , but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.
The largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems. About of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin, but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin. In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover, and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze. Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective. For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon, while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel. In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream. In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.

While many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed. Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, &quot;Takifugu&quot; pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.

===Other animals===

Due to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin&#x27;s inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a &quot;baiji&quot;. However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the &quot;baiji&quot; is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. &quot;Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.&quot; It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.

Numerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and Père David&#x27;s deer.
In addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan&#x27;s box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.

More than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world&#x27;s largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander. It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution. The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct. In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.
The Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics. A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid &quot;Sinopotamon&quot;. The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range. It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed, but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.

The freshwater jellyfish &quot;Craspedacusta sowerbii&quot;, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.

<doc id="6614" wikidata="Q761815" url="?curid=6614" title="Chrono Trigger">
<text>is a 1995 role-playing video game by Square. It was originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the first entry in the &quot;Chrono&quot; series. The game&#x27;s development team included three designers that Square dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;: Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series; Yuji Horii, creator of Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and author of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series. In addition, Takashi Tokita co-directed the game and co-wrote the scenario, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game, while Masato Kato wrote most of the story. The game&#x27;s plot follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was a critical and commercial success upon release, receiving multiple accolades from gaming publications, and is considered one of fourth-generation console gaming&#x27;s most significant titles and among the greatest video games ever made. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine described aspects of the game as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related side-quests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics. The game&#x27;s soundtrack, scored by Yasunori Mitsuda with assistance from veteran &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu, has been hailed as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan, and the various incarnations of the game have shipped more than 3.5 million copies worldwide.

Distributed in the Japanese and North American markets in 1995, the game has been re-released on several other platforms with varying differences. Square published a ported version by Tose in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, which was later repackaged with a &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; port as &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; (2001) exclusively in North America. A slightly enhanced &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan and North America in 2008, and PAL regions in 2009. The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, and Android. In 2018, a higher resolution version was released for Windows via Steam.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; features standard role-playing video game gameplay. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game&#x27;s two-dimensional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.

Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of hit points; successful attacks reduce that character&#x27;s hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, they faint; if all the player&#x27;s characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, a player can equip their characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles. Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in treasure chests. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; story.

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; uses an &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; system—a recurring element of Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game series designed by Hiroyuki Ito for &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;—named &quot;Active Time Battle 2.0&quot;. Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character&#x27;s speed statistic counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called &quot;Techs&quot;. Techs deplete a character&#x27;s magic points (a numerical meter similar to hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist. Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others&#x27; to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono&#x27;s sword-spinning Cyclone Tech can be combined with Lucca&#x27;s Flame Toss to create Fire Whirl. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; features several other distinct gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world&#x27;s history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called &quot;time gates&quot;, as well as a time machine named &quot;Epoch&quot;. The game contains twelve unique endings (thirteen in DS, iOS, Android and Steam versions); the ending the player receives depends on when and how they reach and complete the game&#x27;s final battle. The DS version of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; also introduces a New Game Plus option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character levels, techniques, and equipment, excluding money, with which they ended the previous playthrough. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has employed the New Game Plus concept in later games including &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; among others.

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; takes place in an Earth-like world, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the &quot;Wings of Time,&quot; nicknamed the &quot;Epoch&quot; (this default name can be changed by the player when the vehicle is acquired). The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.

=== Characters ===

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; six playable characters (plus one optional character) come from different eras of history. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; begins in 1000 AD with Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a katana in battle. Marle, revealed to be Princess Nadia, lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, she is at heart a princess who seeks independence from her royal identity. Lucca is a childhood friend of Crono&#x27;s and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of 2300 AD comes Robo, or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with a near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude. The fiercely confident Ayla dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid reptiles known as Reptites.

The last two playable characters are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in 600 AD. He is a former squire once known as Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in 600 AD is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus&#x27;s seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game&#x27;s main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in 1999 AD, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth&#x27;s energy for its own growth.

=== Plot ===
In 1000 AD, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new teleporter at the Millennial Fair in the Kingdom of Guardia. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn. After Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in 600 AD, they locate Marle, only to see her vanish before their eyes. Lucca realizes that this time period&#x27;s kingdom has mistaken Marle (who is actually Princess Nadia of Guardia) for Queen Leene, an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a grandfather paradox. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by rescuing Leene. After the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is framed for kidnapping Marle and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono escape prison, haphazardly using another time portal to evade their pursuers. This portal lands them in 2300 AD, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999 AD, and find the last remnants of humanity living in underground domes subsisting off of machine energy in place of food. The three vow to find a way to prevent the future destruction of their world. After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage residing in an atemporal space known as the End of Time, who offers them the ability to travel through time by way of several pillars of light. (The party is able to challenge Lavos at any point after this scene, with completion of the game prior to its final chapter unlocking one of twelve different endings.)

The party discover that a powerful mage named Magus summoned Lavos into the world in 600 AD. To stop Magus, Frog requires the legendary sword, Masamune, to open the way to the mage&#x27;s castle. In search of ore to re-forge the sword, the party travel to prehistoric times and meet Ayla, the chief of an ancient hunter-gatherer tribe. The subsequent battle with Magus disrupts his spell to summon Lavos, opening a temporal distortion that throws Crono and his friends to prehistory. The party assist Ayla in battling the Reptites, enemies of prehistoric humans. The battle is cut short as the party witness the true origin of Lavos, who descends from deep space and crashes into the planet before burrowing to its core. Entering a time gate created by Lavos&#x27;s impact, the party arrive in the ice age of 12,000 BC. There, the utopic Kingdom of Zeal resides on islands raised above the icy surface using energy harnessed from Lavos&#x27;s body beneath the earth&#x27;s crust via a machine housed on the ocean floor. The party are imprisoned by the Queen of Zeal on the orders of its mysterious Prophet, and are ultimately banished, with the time gate leading to 12,000 BC sealed by the Prophet. Seeking a way to return, the party discover a time machine in 2300 AD called the Wings of Time (or &quot;Epoch&quot;), which can access any time period at will. The party return to 12,000 BC, where Zeal inadvertently awakens Lavos, leading the Prophet to reveal himself as Magus, who tries and fails to kill the creature. Lavos defeats Magus and kills Crono, before the remaining party are transported to the safety of the surface by Schala, Zeal&#x27;s princess. Lavos annihilates the Kingdom of Zeal, whose fallen continent causes devastating floods that submerge most of the world&#x27;s landmass.

Magus confesses to the party that he used to be Prince Janus of Zeal, Schala&#x27;s brother, and that in the original timeline, he and the Gurus of Zeal were scattered across time by Lavos&#x27;s awakening in 12,000 BC. Stranded as a child in 600 AD, Janus took the title of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister. Magus tried once more after the party&#x27;s battle in his castle returned him to Zeal, where he disguised himself as the Prophet. At this point, Magus is either killed by the party, killed in a duel with Frog, or spared and convinced to join the party. The ruined Ocean Palace then rises into the air as the Black Omen, Queen Zeal&#x27;s floating fortress. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, a device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with an identical doppelgänger (doing so is optional, and the game&#x27;s ending will change depending on the player&#x27;s decision). The party then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar&#x27;s instructions. Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics, stopping Robo&#x27;s maniacal AI creator, giving Frog closure for Cyrus&#x27;s death, locating and charging up the mythical Sun Stone, retrieving the legendary Rainbow Shell, unmasking Guardia&#x27;s Chancellor as a saboteur, restoring a forest destroyed by a desert monster, and preventing an accident that disabled Lucca&#x27;s mother. The party then enter the Black Omen and defeat Queen Zeal, after which they battle Lavos. They discover that Lavos is self-directing his evolution via absorbing DNA and energy from every living creature before razing the planet&#x27;s surface in 1999 AD, so that it could spawn a new generation to destroy other worlds and continue the evolutionary cycle. The party slay Lavos, and celebrate at the final night of the Millennial Fair before returning to their own times.

If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. If Crono was resurrected before defeating Lavos, his sentence for kidnapping Marle is revoked by her father, King Guardia XXXIII, thanks to testimonies from Marle&#x27;s ancestors and descendants, whom Crono had helped during his journey. Crono&#x27;s mother accidentally enters the time gate at the Millennial Fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. If Crono was not resurrected, Frog, Robo, and Ayla (along with Magus if he was recruited) chase Gaspar to the Millennial Fair and back again, revealing that Gaspar knows how to resurrect Crono; Marle and Lucca then use the Epoch to travel through time to accomplish this. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos&#x27;s outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia&#x27;s bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. If resurrected, Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other&#x27;s arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

&quot;Chrono Trigger DS&quot; added two new scenarios to the game. In the first, Crono and his friends can help a &quot;lost sanctum&quot; of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to &quot;Trigger&quot; sequel, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. In a New Game Plus, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia. The group can then fight the Dream Devourer, a prototypical form of the &quot;Time Devourer&quot;—a fusion of Schala and Lavos seen in &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.

== Development ==
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was conceived in October 1992 by Hironobu Sakaguchi, producer and creator of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series; Yuji Horii, writer, game designer and creator of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and creator of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series. Traveling to the United States to research computer graphics, the three, that Square dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, decided to create something that &quot;no one had done before&quot;. Toriyama&#x27;s editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, later credited the concept to a fusion of &quot;Dragon Quest plus Final Fantasy&quot;, and arranged for Enix to lend Yuji Horii to Squaresoft for development. After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, the three received a call from Kazuhiko Aoki, who offered to produce. The four met and spent four days brainstorming ideas for the game. Square convened 50–60 developers, including scenario writer Masato Kato, whom Square designated story planner; development started in early 1993. An uncredited Square employee suggested that the team develop a time travel-themed game, which Kato initially opposed, fearing repetitive, dull gameplay. Kato and Horii then met several hours per day during the first year of development to write the game&#x27;s plot; Horii desired a silent protagonist from the outset. Square intended to license the work under the &quot;Mana&quot; franchise and gave it the working title &quot;Maru Island&quot;; Hiromichi Tanaka (the future producer of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;) monitored Toriyama&#x27;s early designs. The team hoped to release it on Nintendo&#x27;s planned Super Famicom Disk Drive; when Nintendo canceled the project, Square reoriented the game for release on a Super Famicom cartridge and rebranded it as &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Tanaka credited the ROM cartridge platform for enabling seamless transition to battles on the field map. While &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; had been planned for a 24-megabit cartridge, Square ultimately chose a 32-megabit platform, enabling additional graphics and music. Torishima later reflected that at least one early revision of the game had been scrapped.

Aoki ultimately produced &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, while director credits were attributed to Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game&#x27;s aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game&#x27;s overall system and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhiko Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott&#x27;s visual work in the film &quot;Alien&quot; as an inspiration for the game&#x27;s lighting. Kamata made the game&#x27;s luminosity and color choice lay between that of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Features originally intended to be used in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; team. According to Tanaka, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (which itself was originally intended to be &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;) was codenamed &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; during development before being called &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2&quot; (&quot;Secret of Mana&quot;), and then the name &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was adopted for a new project. After its release, the development team of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was folded into the &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; team.

Yuji Horii, a fan of time travel fiction (such as the TV series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, &quot;If there&#x27;s a fairground, I just write that there&#x27;s a fairground; I don&#x27;t write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in.&quot; Horii also devised Lavos as the final boss, having wanted the final boss to be an ancient evil. Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle&#x27;s drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game&#x27;s story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as &quot;a long string of errands [...] [such as] &#x27;do this&#x27;, &#x27;take this&#x27;, &#x27;defeat these monsters&#x27;, or &#x27;plant this flag&#x27;.&quot; Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono&#x27;s death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an &quot;Active Time Event Logic&quot; system, &quot;where you can move your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you&quot;, and with players &quot;talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions&quot;, allowing each scene to &quot;have many permutations.&quot; Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game&#x27;s use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, which used static enemy graphics.

Hironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; to &quot;play[ing] around with Toriyama&#x27;s universe,&quot; citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been &quot;impossible with something like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.&quot; When Square suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama&#x27;s sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game&#x27;s testers had previously complained that &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was too difficult; as Horii explained, &quot;It&#x27;s because we know too much. The developers think the game&#x27;s just right; that they&#x27;re being too soft. They&#x27;re thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn&#x27;t figure out things we thought they&#x27;d get easily.&quot; Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or &quot;travel through time again&quot; as an affirmation of the New Game Plus feature: &quot;Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people&#x27;s reactions, even down to the smallest details [...] I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.&quot; The game&#x27;s reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.

=== Music ===


&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was scored primarily by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; composer Nobuo Uematsu and one track by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music. Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, remarking, &quot;maybe your salary will go up.&quot; Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years. He reflected, &quot;I wanted to create music that wouldn&#x27;t fit into any established genre [...] music of an imaginary world. The game&#x27;s director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I&#x27;d always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing.&quot; Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces—such as the game&#x27;s ending theme, &quot;To Far Away Times&quot;—to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to &quot;a certain person with whom [he] wanted to share a generation&quot;. He also tried to use leitmotifs of the &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack. Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square&#x27;s games at the time. Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game&#x27;s release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.

At the time of the game&#x27;s release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing. Square also released a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called &quot;The Brink of Time&quot; by Guido that year. &quot;The Brink of Time&quot; came about because Mitsuda wanted to do something that no one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market. Mitsuda considers &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; a landmark game which helped mature his talent. While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was &quot;rough around the edges&quot;, he maintains that it had &quot;significant influence on [his] life as a composer&quot;. In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of the game, featuring orchestral tracks used in cutscenes. Tsuyoshi Sekito composed four new pieces for the game&#x27;s bonus features which weren&#x27;t included on the soundtrack. Some fans were displeased by Mitsuda&#x27;s absence in creating the port, whose instruments sometimes aurally differed from the original game&#x27;s. Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the &quot;Chrono&quot; series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the main theme, &quot;Frog&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and &quot;To Far Away Times&quot;. He worked with Square Enix to ensure that the music for the Nintendo DS would sound closer to the Super NES version. Mitsuda encouraged feedback about the game&#x27;s soundtrack from contemporary children (who he thought would expect &quot;full symphonic scores blaring out of the speakers&quot;). Fans who preordered the DS version received a special music disc containing two orchestral arrangements of the game&#x27;s music directed by Natsumi Kameoka; Square Enix also held a random prize drawing for two signed copies of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; sheet music. Mitsuda expressed difficulty in selecting the tune for the orchestral medley, eventually picking a tune from each era and certain character themes. Mitsuda later wrote:

Music from the game was performed live by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in 1996 at the Orchestral Game Concert in Tokyo, Japan. A suite of music including &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; is a part of the symphonic world-tour with video game music Play! A Video Game Symphony, where Mitsuda was in attendance for the concert&#x27;s world-premiere in Chicago on May 27, 2006. His suite of &quot;Chrono&quot; music, comprising &quot;Reminiscence&quot;, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross~Time&#x27;s Scar&quot;, &quot;Frog&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and &quot;To Far Away Times&quot; was performed. Mitsuda has also appeared with the Eminence Symphony Orchestra as a special guest. Video Games Live has also featured medleys from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. A medley of Music from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; made of one of the four suites of the &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; concerts in September 2009 which was produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series, conducted by Arnie Roth. Square Enix re-released the game&#x27;s soundtrack, along with a video interview with Mitsuda in July 2009. &quot;Frog&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;Robo&#x27;s Theme&quot; were among the video game music performed during the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In 2022, the main theme continued to feature in the setlist of the 8-Bit Big Band, led by Charlie Rosen.

== Release ==
The team planned to release &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; in late 1994, but release was pushed back to the following year. Early alpha versions of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; were demonstrated at the 1994 and 1995 &quot;V Jump&quot; festivals in Japan. A few months prior to the game&#x27;s release, Square shipped a beta version to magazine reviewers and game stores for review. An unfinished build of the game dated November 17, 1994, it contains unused music tracks, locations, and other features changed or removed from the final release—such as a dungeon named &quot;Singing Mountain&quot; and its eponymous tune. Some names also differed; the character Soysaw (Slash in the US version) was known as Wiener, while Mayonnay (Flea in the US version) was named Ketchappa. The ROM image for this early version was eventually uploaded to the internet, prompting fans to explore and document the game&#x27;s differences, including two unused world map NPC character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain non-player characters. Around the game&#x27;s release, Yuji Horii commented that &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; &quot;went beyond [the development team&#x27;s] expectations&quot;, and Hironobu Sakaguchi congratulated the game&#x27;s graphic artists and field designers. Sakaguchi intended to perfect the &quot;sense of dancing you get from exploring Toriyama&#x27;s worlds&quot; in the event that they would make a sequel.

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; used a 32-megabit ROM cartridge with battery-backed RAM for saved games, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors. The Japanese release of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; included art for the game&#x27;s ending and running counts of items in the player&#x27;s status menu. Developers created the North American version before adding these features to the original build, inadvertently leaving in vestiges of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; early development (such as the piece &quot;Singing Mountain&quot;). Hironobu Sakaguchi asked translator Ted Woolsey to localize &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; for English audiences and gave him roughly thirty days to work. Lacking the help of a modern translation team, he memorized scenarios and looked at drafts of commercial player&#x27;s guides to put dialogue in context. Woolsey later reflected that he would have preferred months, and blames his rushed schedule on the prevailing attitude in Japan that games were children&#x27;s toys rather than serious works. Some of his work was cut due to space constraints, though he still considered &quot;Trigger&quot; &quot;one of the most satisfying games [he] ever worked on or played&quot;. Nintendo of America censored certain dialogue, including references to breastfeeding, consumption of alcohol, and religion.

The original SNES edition of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was released on the Wii download service Virtual Console in Japan on April 26, 2011, in the US on May 16, 2011, and in Europe on May 20, 2011. Previously in April 2008, a &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reader poll had identified &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as the third-most wanted game for the Virtual Console. The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, and Windows.

=== PlayStation ===
Square released an enhanced port of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, the 1999 sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, to familiarize new players with the story leading up to it. This version included anime cutscenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama&#x27;s Bird Studio and animated at Toei Animation, as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cutscenes would illustrate subtle ties to &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. The port was released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;—as &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot;. Reviewers criticized &quot;Chronicles&quot; for its lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features. This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the PlayStation Network on October 4, 2011, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable.

=== Nintendo DS ===
On July 2, 2008, Square Enix announced that they were planning to bring &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. Composer Yasunori Mitsuda was pleased with the project, exclaiming &quot;finally!&quot; after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, &quot;it&#x27;s still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I&#x27;m very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it.&quot; Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, &quot;I wanted it to be based on the original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the PlayStation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That&#x27;s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on.&quot; Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama&#x27;s original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.

The DS re-release contains all of the bonus material from the PlayStation port, as well as other enhancements. The added features include a more accurate and revised translation by Tom Slattery, a dual-screen mode which clears the top screen of all menus, a self-completing map screen, and a default &quot;run&quot; option. It also features the option to choose between two control schemes: one mirroring the original SNES controls, and the other making use of the DS&#x27;s touch screen. Masato Kato participated in development, overseeing the addition of the monster-battling Arena, two new areas, the Lost Sanctum and the Dimensional Vortex, and a new ending that further foreshadows the events of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. One of the areas within the Vortex uses the &quot;Singing Mountain&quot; song that was featured on the original &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; soundtrack. Additionally, one of the dungeons absent from the original game was remade within the Vortex. These new dungeons met with mixed reviews; GameSpot called them &quot;frustrating&quot; and &quot;repetitive&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; noted that &quot;the extra quests in the game connect extremely well.&quot; It was a nominee for &quot;Best RPG for the Nintendo DS&quot; in &quot;IGN&quot;″s 2008 video game awards. The Nintendo DS version of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was the 22nd best-selling game of 2008 in Japan.

=== Mobile ===
A cellphone version was released in Japan on i-mode distribution service on August 25, 2011. An iOS version was released on December 8, 2011. This version is based on the Nintendo DS version, with graphics optimized for iOS. The game was later released for Android on October 29, 2012. An update incorporating most of the features of the Windows version—including the reintroduction of the animated cutscenes, which had been absent from the initial mobile release—was released on February 27, 2018, for both iOS and Android.

=== Windows ===
Square Enix released &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; without an announcement for Windows via Steam on February 27, 2018. This version includes most content from the Nintendo DS port besides the arena mode, as well as the higher resolution graphics from the mobile device releases, support for mouse and keyboard controls, and autosave features, along with additional content such as wallpapers and music. The PC port initially received negative reception due to its inferior graphical quality, additional glitches, UI adapted for touchscreens, and failure to properly adapt the control scheme for keyboards and controllers. In response, Square Enix provided various UI updates and several other improvements including adding an original graphics option based on the game&#x27;s original version, fixing glitches introduced, and adding a true 16:9 widescreen presentation for the first time, to address the aforementioned complaints. In total, five major updates were released—the first on April 10, 2018, and the last on August 3, 2018—all of which have substantially improved its overall reception. On March 11, 2022, a sixth major patch was released; it added ultrawide 21:9 support and other quality of life features and improvements.

== Reception ==
===SNES release===
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; received critical acclaim upon its original SNES release. The gameplay received praise, with &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot; considering it innovative. Both magazines and &quot;Super Play&quot; cited the visibility of enemies in the overworld map and the use of combos as reasons for their enjoyment. Both &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; felt the game was easier than &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, though &quot;GamePro&quot; enjoyed it nonetheless. The graphics and music received praise by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; found them better than in prior role-playing video games such as &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; felt the graphical upgrades shortened the quests, though &quot;Edge&quot; considered them lacking &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; grandness. Evaluations of the story and characters were more mixed. The critics for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; generally found the storyline compelling, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; felt that the game&#x27;s character arcs were well-developed. &quot;Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Super Play&quot; disagreed; they both negatively compared the character arcs to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, with &quot;Super Play&quot; finding Frog&#x27;s story to be the only meaningful one.

===Windows release===
In contrast to the critical acclaim of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;&#x27;s original SNES release, the 2018 Windows port of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was critically panned. Grievances noted by reviewers included tiling errors on textures, the addition of aesthetically intrusive sprite filters, an unattractive GUI carried over from the 2011 mobile release, a lack of graphic customization options, and the inability to remap controls. In describing the port, &quot;Forbes&quot; commented: &quot;From pretty awful graphical issues, such as tiling textures and quite a painful menu system, this port really doesn&#x27;t do this classic game justice.&quot; &quot;USGamer&quot; characterized the Windows release as carrying &quot;all the markings of a project farmed out to the lowest bidder. It&#x27;s a shrug in Square-Enix&#x27;s mind, seemingly not worth the money or effort necessary for a half-decent port.&quot; In a Twitter post detailing his experiences with the Windows version, indie developer Fred Wood derisively compared the port to &quot;someone&#x27;s first attempt at an RPG Maker game&quot;, a comment which was republished across numerous articles addressing the poor quality of the rerelease. Square Enix released six major updates to address the complaints, thus improving its overall reception; Alex Donaldson of &quot;VG247&quot;, commenting on the improvements, wrote that &quot;Square Enix took the criticism to heart and over the course of a string of hefty patches have slowly turned this into something that actually could be argued as the best version of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.&quot;

===Sales===
The game was a best-seller in Japan, where two million copies were sold in only two months. It ended the year as the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan, below &quot;Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation&quot;. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was also met with substantial success upon release in North America, and its re-release on the PlayStation as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; package topped the NPD TRSTS PlayStation sales charts for over six weeks. By March 2003, the game&#x27;s SNES and PS1 iterations had shipped copies worldwide, including 2.36 million in Japan and 290,000 abroad. The PS1 version was re-released in 2003 as part of Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits line. The original SNES version had sold 2.5 million copies by 2006. &quot;Chrono Trigger DS&quot; sold 790,000 copies worldwide, as of March 2009, including 490,000 in Japan, 240,000 in North America and 60,000 in Europe. The SNES, PS1 and DS versions shipped a combined copies worldwide by March 2009. Excluding the PC version, the game had shipped over 3.5 million copies worldwide by February 2018.

=== Awards and accolades ===
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; is frequently listed among the greatest video games of all time. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it the 29th best console video game of all time; while noting that it was not as good as &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (which ranked 9th), they gave superlative praise to its handling of time travel and its combat engine. It has placed highly on all six of multimedia website &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;top 100 games of all time&quot; lists—4th in 2002, 6th in early 2005, 13th in late 2005, 2nd in 2006, 18th in 2007, and 2nd in 2008. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called it its 15th favorite game in 2001. Its staff thought that it was the best non-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game Square had produced at the time. &quot;GameSpot&quot; included &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; in &quot;The Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list released in April 2006, and it also appeared as 28th on an &quot;All Time Top 100&quot; list in a poll conducted by Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; the same year. In 2004, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; finished runner up to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in the inaugural GameFAQs video game battle. In 2008, readers of &quot;Dengeki Online&quot; voted it the eighth best game ever made. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; twentieth anniversary issue named it the fifth best Super NES game. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the DS version of the game 31st on a list of greatest Nintendo games. In 2012, it came 32nd place on &quot;GamesRadar&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 best games of all time&quot; list, and 1st place on its &quot;Best JRPGs&quot; list. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; the 2nd best Super NES game of all time, behind &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

== Legacy ==

=== Add-ons ===
&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; inspired several related releases; the first were three games released for the Satellaview on July 31, 1995. They included &quot;Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special&quot;, a racing video game based on a minigame from the original; &quot;Chrono Trigger: Character Library&quot;, featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and &quot;Chrono Trigger: Music Library&quot;, a collection of music from the game&#x27;s soundtrack. The contents of &quot;Character Library&quot; and &quot;Music Library&quot; were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Production I.G created a 16-minute OVA, &quot;Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar&quot;, which was shown at the Japanese &quot;V Jump&quot; festival of July 31, 1996.

=== Fangames ===
There have been two notable attempts by &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for PC with a 3D graphics engine. &quot;Chrono Resurrection&quot;, an attempt at remaking ten small interactive cutscenes from &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, and &quot;Chrono Trigger Remake Project&quot;, which sought to remake the entire game, were forcibly terminated by Square Enix by way of a cease and desist order. Another group of fans created a sequel via a ROM hack of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; called &quot;Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes&quot;; developed from 2004 to 2009; although feature-length and virtually finished, it also was terminated through a cease &amp; desist letter days before its May 2009 release. The letter also forbade the dissemination of existing &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; ROM hacks and documentation. After the cease and desist was issued, an incomplete version of the game was leaked in May 2009, though due to the early state of the game, playability was limited.
This was followed by a more complete ROM leak in January 2011, which allowed the game to be played from beginning to end.

=== Sequels ===
Square released a related Satellaview game in 1996, named &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;. Having thought that &quot;Trigger&quot; ended with &quot;unfinished business&quot;, scenarist Masato Kato wrote and directed the game. &quot;Dreamers&quot; functioned as a side story to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, resolving a loose subplot from its predecessor. A short, text-based game relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan—though it was translated by fans to English in April 2003. Square planned to release &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, but Kato was unhappy with his work and halted its inclusion.

Square released &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. &quot;Cross&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; featuring a new setting and cast of characters. Presenting a theme of parallel worlds, the story followed the protagonist Serge—a teenage boy thrust into an alternate reality in which he died years earlier. With the help of a thief named Kid, Serge endeavors to discover the truth behind his apparent death and obtain the Frozen Flame, a mythical artifact. Regarded by writer and director Masato Kato as an effort to &quot;redo &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; properly&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; borrowed certain themes, scenarios, characters, and settings from &quot;Dreamers&quot;. Yasunori Mitsuda also adapted certain songs from &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; while scoring &quot;Cross&quot;. &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; was consequently removed from the series&#x27; main continuity, considered an alternate dimension. &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; shipped 1.5 million copies and was widely praised by critics.

There are no plans for a new title, despite a statement from Hironobu Sakaguchi in 2001 that the developers of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; wanted to make a new &quot;Chrono&quot; game. The same year, Square applied for a trademark for the names &quot;Chrono Break&quot; in the United States and &quot;Chrono Brake&quot; in Japan. However, the United States trademark was dropped in 2003. Director Takashi Tokita mentioned &quot;Chrono Trigger 2&quot; in a 2003 interview which has not been translated to English. Yuji Horii expressed no interest in returning to the Chrono franchise in 2005, while Hironobu Sakaguchi remarked in April 2007 that his creation &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; was an &quot;extension of [Chrono Trigger].&quot; During a Cubed³ interview on February 1, 2007, Square Enix&#x27;s Senior Vice President Hiromichi Tanaka said that although no sequel is currently planned, some sort of sequel is still possible if the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; developers can be reunited. Yasunori Mitsuda has expressed interest in scoring a new game, but warned that &quot;there are a lot of politics involved&quot; with the series. He stressed that Masato Kato should participate in development. The February 2008 issue of &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the &quot;Chrono&quot; series eighth among the &quot;Top Ten Sequels in Demand&quot;, naming the games &quot;steadfast legacies in the Square Enix catalogue&quot; and asking, &quot;what&#x27;s the damn holdup?!&quot; In Electronic Gaming Monthly&#x27;s June 2008 &quot;Retro Issue&quot;, writer Jeremy Parish cited &quot;Chrono&quot; as the franchise video game fans would be most thrilled to see a sequel to. In the first May &quot;Famitsu&quot; of 2009, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; placed 14th out of 50 in a vote of most-wanted sequels by the magazine&#x27;s readers. At E3 2009, SE Senior Vice President Shinji Hashimoto remarked, &quot;If people want a sequel, they should buy more!&quot;

In July 2010, Obsidian Entertainment designer Feargus Urquhart, replying to an interview question about what franchises he would like to work on, said that &quot;if [he] could come across everything that [he] played&quot;, he would choose a &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; game. At the time, Obsidian was making &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot; for Square Enix. Urquhart said: &quot;You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it would be great to see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together.&quot; Yoshinori Kitase stated that he used the time travel mechanics of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as a starting point for that of &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;.

<text>The Cornwall Wildlife Trust is a charitable organisation founded in 1962 that is concerned solely with Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

It deals with the conservation and preservation of Cornwall&#x27;s wildlife, geology and habitats managing over 50 nature reserves covering approximately , amongst them Looe Island.

Cornwall Wildlife Trust is part of The Wildlife Trusts partnership of 46 wildlife trusts in the United Kingdom. It works in conjunction with the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust on some matters. Cornwall Wildlife Trust produces a thrice-yearly magazine called &quot;Wild Cornwall&quot;.

The direction and work that the Trust currently does is guided by the Cornwall Biodiversity action plan. Living Seas and Living Landscapes are two such projects. The Trust runs ERCCIS (Environmental Records Centre for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly), a county wide database of sightings of animals and plants, and records of geology. It also gives planning advice (CEC - Cornwall Environmental Consultants) to land developers.

The Trust is based at Allet near Truro in Cornwall. The headquarters and offices are adjacent to the Trust&#x27;s Five Acres nature reserve. This reserve includes two ponds, as well as mixed broadleaved and conifer woodland.

A compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover. The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from &quot;going off to infinity&quot; by in some way adding &quot;points at infinity&quot; or preventing such an &quot;escape&quot;.

== An example ==

Consider the real line with its ordinary topology. This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single &quot;point at infinity&quot; which we will denote by ∞. The resulting compactification is homeomorphic to a circle in the plane (which, as a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane, is compact). Every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to ∞ in this compactification. The direction in which a number approaches infinity on the number line (either in the - direction or + direction) is still preserved on the circle; for if a number approaches towards infinity from the - direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach ∞ from the left for example. Then if a number approaches infinity from the + direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach ∞ from the right.

Intuitively, the process can be pictured as follows: first shrink the real line to the open interval on the &quot;x&quot;-axis; then bend the ends of this interval upwards (in positive &quot;y&quot;-direction) and move them towards each other, until you get a circle with one point (the topmost one) missing. This point is our new point ∞ &quot;at infinity&quot;; adding it in completes the compact circle.

A bit more formally: we represent a point on the unit circle by its angle, in radians, going from − to for simplicity. Identify each such point &quot;θ&quot; on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line tan(&quot;θ&quot;/2). This function is undefined at the point , since tan(/2) is undefined; we will identify this point with our point ∞.

Since tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous, our identification function is a homeomorphism between the real line and the unit circle without ∞. What we have constructed is called the &quot;Alexandroff one-point compactification&quot; of the real line, discussed in more generality below. It is also possible to compactify the real line by adding &quot;two&quot; points, +∞ and −∞; this results in the extended real line.

== Definition ==

An embedding of a topological space &quot;X&quot; as a dense subset of a compact space is called a compactification of &quot;X&quot;. It is often useful to embed topological spaces in compact spaces, because of the special properties compact spaces have.

Embeddings into compact Hausdorff spaces may be of particular interest. Since every compact Hausdorff space is a Tychonoff space, and every subspace of a Tychonoff space is Tychonoff, we conclude that any space possessing a Hausdorff compactification must be a Tychonoff space. In fact, the converse is also true; being a Tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a Hausdorff compactification.

The fact that large and interesting classes of non-compact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology.

=== Alexandroff one-point compactification ===

For any noncompact topological space &quot;X&quot; the (Alexandroff) one-point compactification α&quot;X&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is obtained by adding one extra point ∞ (often called a &quot;point at infinity&quot;) and defining the open sets of the new space to be the open sets of &quot;X&quot; together with the sets of the form &quot;G&quot; ∪ , where &quot;G&quot; is an open subset of &quot;X&quot; such that formula_1 is closed and compact. The one-point compactification of &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff if and only if &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff and locally compact.

=== Stone–Čech compactification ===

Of particular interest are Hausdorff compactifications, i.e., compactifications in which the compact space is Hausdorff. A topological space has a Hausdorff compactification if and only if it is Tychonoff. In this case, there is a unique (up to homeomorphism) &quot;most general&quot; Hausdorff compactification, the Stone–Čech compactification of &quot;X&quot;, denoted by &quot;βX&quot;; formally, this exhibits the category of Compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a reflective subcategory of the category of Tychonoff spaces and continuous maps.

&quot;Most general&quot; or formally &quot;reflective&quot; means that the space &quot;βX&quot; is characterized by the universal property that any continuous function from &quot;X&quot; to a compact Hausdorff space &quot;K&quot; can be extended to a continuous function from &quot;βX&quot; to &quot;K&quot; in a unique way. More explicitly, &quot;βX&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space containing &quot;X&quot; such that the induced topology on &quot;X&quot; by &quot;βX&quot; is the same as the given topology on &quot;X&quot;, and for any continuous map , where &quot;K&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique continuous map for which &quot;g&quot; restricted to &quot;X&quot; is identically &quot;f&quot;.

The Stone–Čech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows: let &quot;C&quot; be the set of continuous functions from &quot;X&quot; to the closed interval . Then each point in &quot;X&quot; can be identified with an evaluation function on &quot;C&quot;. Thus &quot;X&quot; can be identified with a subset of , the space of &quot;all&quot; functions from &quot;C&quot; to . Since the latter is compact by Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, the closure of &quot;X&quot; as a subset of that space will also be compact. This is the Stone–Čech compactification.
=== Spacetime compactification ===
Walter Benz and Isaak Yaglom have shown how stereographic projection onto a single-sheet hyperboloid can be used to provide a compactification for split complex numbers. In fact, the hyperboloid is part of a quadric in real projective four-space. The method is similar to that used to provide a base manifold for group action of the conformal group of spacetime.

== Projective space ==
Real projective space RP&quot;n&quot; is a compactification of Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot;. For each possible &quot;direction&quot; in which points in R&quot;n&quot; can &quot;escape&quot;, one new point at infinity is added (but each direction is identified with its opposite). The Alexandroff one-point compactification of R we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to RP1. Note however that the projective plane RP2 is &quot;not&quot; the one-point compactification of the plane R2 since more than one point is added.

Complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot; is also a compactification of C&quot;n&quot;; the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the plane C is (homeomorphic to) the complex projective line CP1, which in turn can be identified with a sphere, the Riemann sphere.

Passing to projective space is a common tool in algebraic geometry because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems. For example, any two different lines in RP2 intersect in precisely one point, a statement that is not true in R2. More generally, Bézout&#x27;s theorem, which is fundamental in intersection theory, holds in projective space but not affine space. This distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in algebraic topology in the cohomology rings – the cohomology of affine space is trivial, while the cohomology of projective space is non-trivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory (dimension and degree of a subvariety, with intersection being Poincaré dual to the cup product).

Compactification of moduli spaces generally require allowing certain degeneracies – for example, allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties. This is notably used in the Deligne–Mumford compactification of the moduli space of algebraic curves.

== Compactification and discrete subgroups of Lie groups ==

In the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups, the quotient space of cosets is often a candidate for more subtle compactification to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological.

For example, modular curves are compactified by the addition of single points for each cusp, making them Riemann surfaces (and so, since they are compact, algebraic curves). Here the cusps are there for a good reason: the curves parametrize a space of lattices, and those lattices can degenerate (&#x27;go off to infinity&#x27;), often in a number of ways (taking into account some auxiliary structure of &quot;level&quot;). The cusps stand in for those different &#x27;directions to infinity&#x27;.

That is all for lattices in the plane. In -dimensional Euclidean space the same questions can be posed, for example about formula_2 This is harder to compactify. There are a variety of compactifications, such as the Borel–Serre compactification, the reductive Borel–Serre compactification, and the Satake compactifications, that can be formed.

== Other compactification theories ==

* The theories of ends of a space and prime ends.
* Some &#x27;boundary&#x27; theories such as the collaring of an open manifold, Martin boundary, Shilov boundary and Furstenberg boundary.
* The Bohr compactification of a topological group arises from the consideration of almost periodic functions.
* The projective line over a ring for a topological ring may compactify it.
* The Baily–Borel compactification of a quotient of a Hermitian symmetric space.
* The wonderful compactification of a quotient of algebraic groups.
* The compactifications that are simultaneously convex subsets in a locally convex space are called convex compactifications, their additional linear structure allowing e.g. for developing a differential calculus and more advanced considerations e.g. in relaxation in variational calculus or optimization theory.

<doc id="6620" wikidata="Q1713076" url="?curid=6620" title="Cotangent space">
<text>In differential geometry, the cotangent space is a vector space associated with a point formula_1 on a smooth (or differentiable) manifold formula_2; one can define a cotangent space for every point on a smooth manifold. Typically, the cotangent space, formula_3 is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at &quot;formula_1&quot;, formula_5, although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors.

==Properties==
All cotangent spaces at points on a connected manifold have the same dimension, equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be &quot;glued together&quot; (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the cotangent bundle of the manifold.

The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a Riemannian metric or a symplectic form gives rise to a natural isomorphism between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.

==Formal definitions==

===Definition as linear functionals===

Let formula_2 be a smooth manifold and let formula_1 be a point in formula_2. Let formula_5 be the tangent space at formula_1. Then the cotangent space at formula_1 is defined as the dual space of 

:formula_12

Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are linear functionals on formula_5. That is, every element formula_14 is a linear map
:formula_15

where formula_16 is the underlying field of the vector space being considered, for example, the field of real numbers. The elements of formula_3 are called cotangent vectors.

===Alternative definition===

In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on formula_2. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are equivalent at a point formula_1 if they have the same first-order behavior near formula_1, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; have the same first order behavior near formula_1 if and only if the derivative of the function &quot;f&quot; − &quot;g&quot; vanishes at formula_1. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near formula_1.

Let formula_2 be a smooth manifold and let formula_1 be a point in formula_2. Let formula_27be the ideal of all functions in formula_28 vanishing at formula_1, and let formula_30 be the set of functions of the form formula_31, where formula_32. Then formula_27 and formula_30 are both real vector spaces and the cotangent space can be defined as the quotient space formula_35 by showing that the two spaces are isomorphic to each other.

This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the Zariski tangent space in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to locally ringed spaces.

==The differential of a function==

Let formula_36 be a smooth manifold and let formula_37 be a smooth function. The differential of formula_38 at a point formula_1 is the map
:formula_40
where formula_41 is a tangent vector at formula_1, thought of as a derivation. That is formula_43 is the Lie derivative of formula_38 in the direction formula_45, and one has formula_46. Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write
:formula_47
In either case, formula_48 is a linear map on formula_49 and hence it is a tangent covector at formula_1.

We can then define the differential map formula_51 at a point formula_1 as the map which sends formula_38 to formula_48. Properties of the differential map include:

# formula_55 is a linear map: formula_56 for constants formula_57 and formula_58,
# formula_59

The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Since for all formula_60 there exist formula_61 such that formula_62, we have, formula_63formula_64formula_65formula_66 i.e. All function in formula_67 have differential zero, it follows that for every two functions formula_68, formula_69, we have formula_70. We can now construct an isomorphism between formula_3 and formula_72 by sending linear maps formula_73 to the corresponding cosets formula_74. Since there is a unique linear map for a given kernel and slope, this is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.

==The pullback of a smooth map==

Just as every differentiable map formula_75 between manifolds induces a linear map (called the &quot;pushforward&quot; or &quot;derivative&quot;) between the tangent spaces
:formula_76
every such map induces a linear map (called the &quot;pullback&quot;) between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:
:formula_77
The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the pushforward. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:
:formula_78
where formula_79 and formula_80. Note carefully where everything lives.

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let formula_81 be a smooth function on formula_82 vanishing at formula_83. Then the pullback of the covector determined by formula_81 (denoted formula_85) is given by
:formula_86
That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on formula_36 vanishing at formula_1 determined by formula_89.

==Exterior powers==

The formula_90-th exterior power of the cotangent space, denoted formula_91, is another important object in differential and algebraic geometry. Vectors in the formula_90-th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the formula_90-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, are called differential formula_90-forms. They can be thought of as alternating, multilinear maps on formula_90 tangent vectors. 
For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called &quot;one-forms&quot;.

<text>Cnidaria ( ) is a phylum under kingdom Animalia containing over 11,000 species of aquatic invertebrates found both in fresh water and marine environments (predominantly the latter), including jellyfish, hydroids, sea anemones, corals and some of the smallest marine parasites. Their distinguishing features are an uncentralized nervous system distributed throughout a gelatinous body and the presence of cnidocytes or cnidoblasts, specialized cells with ejectable flagella used mainly for envenomation and capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living, jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. Cnidarians are also some of the few animals that can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

Cnidarians mostly have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes, which are specialized stinging cells used to capture prey. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians&#x27; activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Cnidarians also have rhopalia, which are involved in gravity sensing and sometimes chemoreception. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, but many species have complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae stages. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage, and the parasitic classes evolved to have neither form.

Cnidarians were formerly grouped with ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa (a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and which has both sessile members, such as &quot;Hydra&quot;, and colonial swimmers (such as the Portuguese man o&#x27; war)). Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the highly derived parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were firmly recognized as cnidarians only in 2007.

Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from symbiotic dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.

Cnidarians are a very ancient phylum, with fossils having been found in rocks formed about during the Ediacaran period, preceding the Cambrian Explosion. Other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before and diversified a few million years later. Molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial genes suggests an even older age for the crown group of cnidarians, estimated around , almost 200 million years before the Cambrian period, as well as before any fossils. Recent phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of cnidarians, as well as the position of cnidarians as the sister group of bilaterians.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;cnidaria&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek word &quot;knídē&quot; ( “nettle”), signifying the coiled thread reminiscent of cnidocytes..

==Distinguishing features==

Cnidarians form a phylum of animals that are more complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. Both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire harpoon-like structures that are mainly used to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes can also be used as anchors. Cnidarians are also distinguished by the fact that they have only one opening in their body for ingestion and excretion i.e. they do not have a separate mouth and anus.

Like sponges and ctenophores, cnidarians have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence, cnidarians and ctenophores have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer. As a result, some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, and it has been suggested that cnidarians evolved from triploblastic ancestors.


==Description==

===Basic body forms===

Most adult cnidarians appear as either free-swimming medusae or sessile polyps, and many hydrozoans species are known to alternate between the two forms.

Both are radially symmetrical, like a wheel and a tube respectively. Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as &quot;oral&quot; (nearest the mouth) and &quot;aboral&quot; (furthest from the mouth).

Most have fringes of tentacles equipped with cnidocytes around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. Some hydroids may consist of colonies of zooids that serve different purposes, such as defence, reproduction and catching prey. The mesoglea of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of jet propulsion.

===Skeletons===
In medusae, the only supporting structure is the mesoglea. &quot;Hydra&quot; and most sea anemones close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as &quot;Tubularia&quot; use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.

In some colonial polyps, a chitinous epidermis gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.

A mineralized exoskeleton made of calcium carbonate is found in subphylum Anthozoa in the order Scleractinia (stony corals; class Hexacorallia) and the class Octocorallia, and in subphylum Medusozoa in three hydrozoan families in order Anthoathecata; Milleporidae, Stylasteridae and Hydractiniidae (the latter with a mix of calcified and uncalcified species).

===Main cell layers===
Cnidaria are diploblastic animals; in other words, they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are triploblasts having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form epithelia that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous basement membrane, which they secrete. They also secrete the jelly-like mesoglea that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the ectoderm (&quot;outside skin&quot;), generally contains the following types of cells:
*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form muscle fibers in parallel rows. The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one. In Anthozoa (anemones, corals, etc.) and Scyphozoa (jellyfish), the mesoglea also contains some muscle cells.
*Cnidocytes, the harpoon-like &quot;nettle cells&quot; that give the phylum Cnidaria its name. These appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells.
*Nerve cells. Sensory cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells, and communicate via synapses (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with motor nerve cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells. Some form a simple nerve net.
*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types. These are found between the bases of muscle cells.

In addition to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm (&quot;stomach skin&quot;) contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes. In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes, which are used to subdue prey that is still struggling.

The mesoglea contains small numbers of amoeba-like cells, and muscle cells in some species. However, the number of middle-layer cells and types are much lower than in sponges.

===Polymorphism===
Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of structurally and functionally more than two different types of individuals within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of cnidarians, particularly the polyp and medusa forms, or of zooids within colonial organisms like those in Hydrozoa. In Hydrozoans, colonial individuals arising from individual zooids will take on separate tasks. For example, in &quot;Obelia&quot; there are feeding individuals, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of asexual reproduction only, the gonozooids, blastostyles and free-living or sexually reproducing individuals, the medusae.

===Cnidocytes===
These &quot;nettle cells&quot; function as harpoons, since their s remain connected to the bodies of the cells by threads. Three types of cnidocytes are known:
*Nematocysts inject venom into prey, and usually have barbs to keep them embedded in the victims. Most species have nematocysts.
*Spirocysts do not penetrate the victim or inject venom, but entangle it by means of small sticky hairs on the thread.
*Ptychocysts are not used for prey capture — instead the threads of discharged ptychocysts are used for building protective tubes in which their owners live. Ptychocysts are found only in the order Ceriantharia, tube anemones.

The main components of a cnidocyte are:
*A cilium (fine hair) which projects above the surface and acts as a trigger. Spirocysts do not have cilia.
*A tough capsule, the cnida, which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals that may include venom or adhesives or both. (&quot;cnida&quot; is derived from the Greek word κνίδη, which means &quot;nettle&quot;)
*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the &quot;finger&quot;&#x27;s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.
*The thread, which is an extension of the &quot;finger&quot; and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.
*An operculum (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.
*The cell body, which produces all the other parts.

It is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:
*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.
*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.
*In the case of &quot;Chironex&quot; (the &quot;sea wasp&quot;), chemical changes in the cnida&#x27;s contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization.
*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more concentrated solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class Hydrozoa, sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 atmospheres, similar to that of scuba air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2 milliseconds (0.002 second).

Cnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra&#x27;s nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48 hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.

===Locomotion===

Medusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.

Hydras and some sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.

===Nervous system and senses===
Cnidarians are generally thought to have no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue that could be considered some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though each clade has slightly different structures. These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, chemical changes, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the motor nerve net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles. Most cnidarians also have a parallel system. In scyphozoans, this takes the form of a diffuse nerve net, which has modulatory effects on the nervous system. As well as forming the &quot;signal cables&quot; between sensory neurons and motoneurons, intermediate neurons in the nerve net can also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers. Communication between nerve cells can occur by chemical synapses or gap junctions in hydrozoans, though gap junctions are not present in all groups. Cnidarians have many of the same neurotransmitters as bilaterians, including chemicals such as glutamate, GABA, and glycine. Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, octopamine, histamine, and acetylcholine, on the other hand, are absent.

This structure ensures that the musculature is excited rapidly and simultaneously, and can be directly stimulated from any point on the body, and it also is better able to recover after injury.

Medusae and complex swimming colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration by means of statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing the strength of the swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli (&quot;simple eyes&quot;), which can detect sources of light. However, the agile box jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.

===Feeding and excretion===
Cnidarians feed in several ways: predation, absorbing dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles out of the water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the corals &quot;Hetroxenia&quot; and &quot;Leptogorgia&quot;, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, and protection against predators.

Predatory species use their cnidocytes to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous nematocysts may start digestion by injecting digestive enzymes. The &quot;smell&quot; of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae, the tentacles around the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by &quot;oral arms&quot;, which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. These &quot;oral arms&quot; aid in cnidarians&#x27; ability to move prey towards their mouth once it has been poisoned and entangled. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of cilia whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of mucus to trap particles. Their digestion is both intra and extracellular.

Once the food is in the digestive cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.

Indigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells&#x27; internal processes is ammonia, which is removed by the external and internal water currents.

===Respiration===
There are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.

Cnidaria that carry photosynthetic symbionts may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove toxic. The animals produce large quantities of antioxidants to neutralize the excess oxygen.

===Regeneration===
All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.

==Reproduction==
===Sexual===
Cnidarian sexual reproduction often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies), a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adult medusae have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.

This phenomenon of succession of differently organized generations (one asexually reproducing, sessile polyp, followed by a free-swimming medusa or a sessile polyp that reproduces sexually) is sometimes called &quot;alternation of asexual and sexual phases&quot; or &quot;metagenesis&quot;, but should not be confused with the alternation of generations as found in plants.

Shortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. &quot;hydra&quot;) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (&quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot; and &quot;Laodicea undulata&quot;) and Scyphozoa (&quot;Aurelia&quot; sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.

Spawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage — one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.

The fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere (blastula) and then a depression forms at one end (gastrulation) and eventually becomes the digestive cavity. However, in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the animal pole), while in bilaterians it forms at the other end (vegetal pole). The larvae, called planulae, swim or crawl by means of cilia. They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the &quot;front&quot; end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.

Anthozoan larvae either have large yolks or are capable of feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae&#x27;s range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.

===Asexual===
All known cnidarians can reproduce asexually by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult. The ability of cnidarians to asexually reproduce ensures a greater number of mature medusa that can mature to reproduce sexually.

===DNA repair===

Two classical DNA repair pathways, nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair, are present in hydra, and these repair pathways facilitate unhindered reproduction. The identification of these pathways in hydra is based, in part, on the presence in the hydra genome of genes homologous to genes in other genetically well studied species that have been demonstrated to play key roles in these DNA repair pathways.

==Classification==
Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as &quot;Hydra&quot; and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o&#x27; War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.

Stauromedusae, small sessile cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have traditionally been classified as members of the Scyphozoa, but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.

The Myxozoa, microscopic parasites, were first classified as protozoans. Research then found that &quot;Polypodium hydriforme&quot;, a non-myxozoan parasite &quot;within&quot; the egg cells of sturgeon, is closely related to the Myxozoa and suggested that both &quot;Polypodium&quot; and the Myxozoa were intermediate between cnidarians and bilaterian animals. More recent research demonstrates that the previous identification of bilaterian genes reflected contamination of the myxozoan samples by material from their host organism, and they are now firmly identified as heavily derived cnidarians, and more closely related to Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa than to Anthozoa.

Some researchers classify the extinct conulariids as cnidarians, while others propose that they form a completely separate phylum.

Current classification according to the World Register of Marine Species: 
* class Anthozoa 
** subclass Ceriantharia — Tube-dwelling anemones
** subclass Hexacorallia — stony corals
** subclass Octocorallia — soft corals and sea fans
* class Cubozoa — box jellies
* class Hydrozoa — hydrozoans (fire corals, hydroids, hydroid jellyfishes, siphonophores...)
* class Myxozoa — obligate parasites
* class Polypodiozoa — (uncertain status)
* class Scyphozoa — &quot;true&quot; jellyfishes
* class Staurozoa — stalked jellyfishes

==Ecology==
Many cnidarians are limited to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. Hydrozoans have a worldwide range: some, such as &quot;Hydra&quot;, live in freshwater; &quot;Obelia&quot; appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and &quot;Liriope&quot; can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among anthozoans, a few scleractinian corals, sea pens and sea fans live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over below sea-level. Reef-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30°N and 30°S with a maximum depth of , temperatures between , high salinity, and low carbon dioxide levels. Stauromedusae, although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters. Cnidarians range in size from a mere handful of cells for the parasitic myxozoans through &quot;Hydra&quot;&#x27;s length of , to the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish, which may exceed in diameter and in length.

Prey of cnidarians ranges from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, flatworms and comb jellies, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense (nematocysts used by cnidarian predators are referred to as kleptocnidae); starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clownfish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.

Coral reefs form some of the world&#x27;s most productive ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support a wide range of other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and seagrass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.

==Evolutionary history==

===Fossil record===
The earliest widely accepted animal fossils are rather modern-looking cnidarians, possibly from around , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation can only be dated approximately. The identification of some of these as embryos of animals has been contested, but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals. Their presence implies that the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages had already diverged. Although the Ediacaran fossil &quot;Charnia&quot; used to be classified as a jellyfish or sea pen, more recent study of growth patterns in &quot;Charnia&quot; and modern cnidarians has cast doubt on this hypothesis, leaving the Canadian polyp &quot;Haootia&quot; and the British &quot;Auroralumina&quot; as the only recognized cnidarian body fossils from the Ediacaran. &quot;Auroralumina&quot; is the earliest known animal predator. Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks, except in Lagerstätten that preserved soft-bodied animals.

A few mineralized fossils that resemble corals have been found in rocks from the Cambrian period, and corals diversified in the Early Ordovician. These corals, which were wiped out in the Permian–Triassic extinction event about , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the Mesozoic era, rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian corals.

===Phylogeny===

It is difficult to reconstruct the early stages in the evolutionary &quot;family tree&quot; of animals using only morphology (their shapes and structures) because of the large differences between the major groups of animals. Hence, reconstructions now rely almost entirely on molecular phylogenetics, which groups organisms based on their biochemistry, most commonly by analyzing DNA or RNA sequences.

In 1866, it was proposed that Cnidaria and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata (&quot;hollow guts&quot;) because both rely on the flow of water in and out of a single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, such as a middle layer of cells (mesoglea in Ctenophora, mesoderm in Bilateria) between the outer and inner layer found in other animals. However, more recent analyses indicate that these similarities were evolved independently in both lineages, instead of being present in their common ancestor. The current view is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled &quot;Planulozoa&quot;, named so because the earliest Bilateria were probably similar to the planula larvae of Cnidaria.

In 2005, Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have striated muscle, which in bilaterians arises from the mesoderm. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.

Resolving the evolutionary relationships within Cnidaria has also been challenging, with almost every possible combination of clades being proposed. As time went on though, a semi-consensus has started to emerge. The enigmatic &quot;Polypodium hydriforme&quot; and subphylum Myxozoa have been firmly placed within the Cnidaria and have been shown to be closely related to the Medusozoa. In addition, these two groups have been found to likely be each others closest relatives which, if true, would form the clade &quot;Endocnidozoa&quot;. The relationships within the Medusozoa are currently probably the most contentious part of the tree. Traditionally, the class Scyphozoa also included Staurozoa and Cubozoa, but significant morphological differences eventually lead to the split of the three. The group containing them has since been named &quot;Acraspeda&quot;. The relationships between these three and Hydrozoa have since and still are debated. A relationship between Scyphozoa and Cubozoa with Staurozoa as its sister has seen support in nearly all studies, but the position of the remaining class, Hydrozoa, is not understood. Several studies have found that Acraspeda is paraphyletic, with Hydrozoa being more closely related to Scyphozoa than to the other classes. At the same time, other studies have recovered Acraspeda as being monophyletic. The subphylum Anthozoa is argued to have either two or three classes, but the relationships between them is not disputed; the tube-dwelling anemones of the class Ceriantharia have consistently shown to be more closely related to the Hexacorallia than to the Octocorallia.

In molecular phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important groups of developmental genes show the same variety in cnidarians as in chordates. In fact cnidarians, and especially anthozoans (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants and fungi but not in bilaterians.

==Interaction with humans==
Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 people in the 20th century, and cubozoans are particularly dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.

Beaches protected from tides and storms by coral reefs are often the best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, because much of the organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.

Some large jellyfish species of the Rhizostomeae order are commonly consumed in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. In parts of the range, fishing industry is restricted to daylight hours and calm conditions in two short seasons, from March to May and August to November. The commercial value of jellyfish food products depends on the skill with which they are prepared, and &quot;Jellyfish Masters&quot; guard their trade secrets carefully. Jellyfish is very low in cholesterol and sugars, but cheap preparation can introduce undesirable amounts of heavy metals.

The &quot;sea wasp&quot; &quot;Chironex fleckeri&quot; has been described as the world&#x27;s most venomous jellyfish and is held responsible for 67 deaths, although it is difficult to identify the animal as it is almost transparent. Most stingings by &quot;C. fleckeri&quot; cause only mild symptoms. Seven other box jellies can cause a set of symptoms called Irukandji syndrome, which takes about 30 minutes to develop, and from a few hours to two weeks to disappear. Hospital treatment is usually required, and there have been a few deaths.

A number of the parasitic myxozoans are commercially important pathogens in salmonid aquaculture. A Scyphozoa species – &quot;Pelagia noctiluca&quot; – and a Hydrozoa – &quot;Muggiaea atlantica&quot; – have caused repeated mass mortality in salmon farms over the years around Ireland. A loss valued at £1 million struck in November 2007, 20,000 died off Clare Island in 2013 and four fish farms collectively lost tens of thousands of salmon in September 2017.

<doc id="6623" wikidata="Q205644" url="?curid=6623" title="Conservative Judaism">
<text>Conservative Judaism, also known as Masorti Judaism, is a Jewish religious movement that regards the authority of Jewish law and tradition as emanating primarily from the assent of the people through the generations, more than from divine revelation. It therefore views Jewish law, or &quot;Halakha&quot;, as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency, when determining its stance on matters of practice. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of &quot;Halakhic&quot; discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.

While regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel&#x27;s 19th-century positive-historical school in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and the New York–based Jewish Theological Seminary of America operates as its largest rabbinic seminary. Globally, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization Masorti Olami. Conservative Judaism is the third-largest Jewish religious movement worldwide, estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, including over 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.

==Theology==
===Attitude===
Conservative Judaism, from its earliest stages, was marked by ambivalence and ambiguity in all matters theological. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered its intellectual progenitor, believed the very notion of theology was alien to traditional Judaism. He was often accused of obscurity on the subject by his opponents, both Reform and Orthodox. The American movement largely espoused a similar approach, and its leaders mostly avoided the field. Only in 1985 did a course about Conservative theology open in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). The hitherto sole major attempt to define a clear credo was made in 1988, with the Statement of Principles &quot;Emet ve-Emunah&quot; (Truth and Belief), formulated and issued by the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism. The introduction stated that &quot;lack of definition was useful&quot; in the past but a need to articulate one now arose. The platform provided many statements citing key concepts such as God, revelation and Election, but also acknowledged that a variety of positions and convictions existed within its ranks, eschewing strict delineation of principles and often expressing conflicting views. In a 1999 special edition of &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; dedicated to the matter, leading rabbis Elliot N. Dorff and Gordon Tucker stated that &quot;the great diversity&quot; within the movement &quot;makes the creation of a theological vision shared by all neither possible nor desirable&quot;.

===God and eschatology===
Conservative Judaism largely upholds the theistic notion of a personal God. &quot;Emet ve-Emunah&quot; stated that &quot;we affirm our faith in God as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny.&quot;
Concurrently, the platform also noted that His nature was &quot;elusive&quot; and subject to many options of belief. A naturalistic conception of divinity, regarding it as inseparable from the mundane world, once had an important place within the movement, especially represented by Mordecai Kaplan. After Kaplan&#x27;s Reconstructionism fully coalesced into an independent movement, these views were marginalized.

A similarly inconclusive position is expressed toward other precepts. Most theologians adhere to the Immortality of the Soul, but while references to the Resurrection of the Dead are maintained, English translations of the prayers obscure the issue. In &quot;Emet&quot;, it was stated that death is not tantamount to the end of one&#x27;s personality. Relating to the Messianic ideal, the movement rephrased most petitions for the restoration of the Sacrifices into past tense, rejecting a renewal of animal offerings, though not opposing a Return to Zion and even a New Temple. The 1988 platform announced that &quot;some&quot; believe in classic eschatology, but dogmatism in this matter was &quot;philosophically unjustified&quot;. The notions of Election of Israel and God&#x27;s covenant with it were basically retained as well.

===Revelation===
Conservative conception of Revelation encompasses an extensive spectrum. Zecharias Frankel himself applied critical-scientific methods to analyze the stages in the development of the Oral Torah, pioneering modern study of the Mishnah. He regarded the Beatified Sages as innovators who added their own, original contribution to the canon, not merely as expounders and interpreters of a legal system given in its entirety to Moses on Mount Sinai. Yet he also vehemently rejected utilizing these disciplines on the Pentateuch, maintaining it was beyond human reach and wholly celestial in origin. Frankel never elucidated his beliefs, and the exact correlation between human and divine in his thought is still subject to scholarly debate. A similar negative approach toward Higher Criticism, while accepting an evolutionary understanding of Oral Law, defined Rabbi Alexander Kohut, Solomon Schechter and the early generation of American Conservative Judaism. When JTS faculty began to embrace Biblical criticism in the 1920s, they adapted a theological view consistent with it: an original, verbal revelation did occur at Sinai, but the text itself was composed by later authors. The latter, classified by Dorff as a relatively moderate metamorphosis of the old one, is still espoused by few traditionalist right-wing Conservative rabbis, though it is marginalized among senior leadership.

A small but influential segment within the JTS and the movement adhered, from the 1930s, to Mordecai Kaplan&#x27;s philosophy that denied any form of revelation but viewed all scripture as a purely human product. Along with other Reconstructionist tenets, it dwindled as the latter consolidated into a separate group. Kaplan&#x27;s views and the permeation of Higher Criticism gradually swayed most Conservative thinkers towards a non-verbal understanding of theophany, which has become dominant in the 1970s. This was in sync with the wider trend of lowering rates of Americans who accepted the Bible as the Word of God. Dorff categorized the proponents of this into two schools. One maintains that God projected some form of message which inspired the human authors of the Pentateuch to record what they perceived. The other is often strongly influenced by Franz Rosenzweig and other existentialists, but also attracted many Objectivists who consider human reason paramount. The second school states that God conferred merely his presence on those he influenced, without any communication, and the experience drove them to spiritual creativity. While they differ in the theoretical level surrounding revelation, both practically regard all scripture and religious tradition as a human product with certain divine inspiration—providing an understanding that recognizes Biblical Criticism and also justifies major innovation in religious conduct. The first doctrine, advocated by such leaders as rabbis Ben-Zion Bokser and Robert Gordis, largely imparted that some elements within Judaism are fully divine but determining which would be impractical, and therefore received forms of interpretation should be basically upheld. Exponents of the latter view, among them rabbis Louis Jacobs and Neil Gillman, also emphasized the encounter of God with the Jews as a collective and the role of religious authorities through the generations in determining what it implied. The stress on the supremacy of community and tradition, rather than individual consciousness, defines the entire spectrum of Conservative thought.

==Ideology==

The Conservative mainstay was the adoption of the historical-critical method in understanding Judaism and setting its future course. In accepting an evolutionary approach to the religion, as something that developed over time and absorbed considerable external influences, the movement distinguished between the original meaning implied in traditional sources and the manner they were grasped by successive generations, rejecting belief in an unbroken chain of interpretation from God&#x27;s original Revelation, immune to any major extraneous effects. This evolutionary perception of religion, while relatively moderate in comparison with more radical modernizers—the scholarship of the Positive-Historical school, for example, sought to demonstrate the continuity and cohesiveness of Judaism over the years—still challenged Conservative leaders.

They regarded tradition and received mores with reverence, especially the continued adherence to the mechanism of Religious Law (&quot;Halakha&quot;), opposing indiscriminate modification, and emphasized they should be changed only with care and caution and remain observed by the people. Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, summarizing his movement&#x27;s position, wrote:

This discrepancy between scientific criticism and insistence on heritage had to be compensated by a conviction that would forestall either deviation from accepted norms or laxity and apathy.

A key doctrine which was to fulfil this capacity was the collective will of the Jewish people. Conservatives lent great weight in determining religious practice, both in historical precedent and as a means to shape present conduct. Zecharias Frankel pioneered this approach; as Michael A. Meyer commented, &quot;the extraordinary status which he ascribed to the ingrained beliefs and practices of the community is probably the most original element of his thought.&quot; He turned it into a source of legitimacy for both change and preservation, but mostly the latter. The basic moderation and traditionalism of the majority among the people were to guarantee a sense of continuity and unity, restraining the guiding rabbis and scholars who at his age were intent on reform but also allowing them manoeuvrability in adopting or discarding certain elements. Solomon Schechter espoused a similar position. He turned the old rabbinic concept of &quot;K&#x27;lal Yisrael&quot;, which he translated as &quot;Catholic Israel&quot;, into a comprehensive worldview. For him, the details of divine Revelation were of secondary significance, as historical change dictated its interpretation through the ages notwithstanding: &quot;The centre of authority is actually removed from the Bible&quot;, he surmised, &quot;and placed in some living body... in touch with the ideal aspirations and the religious needs of the age, best able to determine... This living body, however, is not represented by... Priesthood, or Rabbihood, but by the collective conscience of Catholic Israel.&quot;

The scope, limits and role of this corpus were a matter for contention in Conservative ranks. Schechter himself used it to oppose any major break with either traditionalist or progressive elements within American Jewry of his day, while some of his successors argued that the idea became obsolete due to the great alienation of many from received forms, that had to be countered by innovative measures to draw them back. The Conservative rabbinate often vacillated on to which degree may the non-practicing, religiously apathetic strata be included as a factor within Catholic Israel, providing impulse for them in determining religious questions; even avant-garde leaders acquiesced that the majority could not serve that function. Right-wing critics often charged that the movement allowed its uncommitted laity an exaggerated role, conceding to its demands and successively stretching &quot;halakhic&quot; boundaries beyond any limit.

The Conservative leadership had limited success in imparting their worldview to the general public. While the rabbinate perceived itself as bearing a unique, original conception of Judaism, the masses lacked much interest, regarding it mainly as a compromise offering a channel for religious identification that was more traditional than Reform Judaism yet less strict than Orthodoxy. Only a low percentage of Conservative congregants actively pursue an observant lifestyle: in the mid-1980s, Charles Liebman and Daniel J. Elazar calculated that barely 3 to 4 per cent held to one quite thoroughly. This gap between principle and the public, more pronounced than in any other Jewish movement, is often credited at explaining the decline of the Conservative movement. While some 41 per cent of American Jews identified with it in the 1970s, it had shrunk to an estimated 18 per cent (and 11 per cent among those under 30) in 2013.

==Jewish law==
===Role===
Fidelity and commitment to &quot;Halakha&quot;, while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without, were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism. The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding, and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts, like Sabbath, dietary ordinances, ritual purity, daily prayer with phylacteries and the like. Concurrently, examining Jewish history and rabbinic literature through the lens of academic criticism, it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution, and must continue to do so. &quot;Emet ve-Emunah&quot; titled its chapter on the subject with &quot;The Indispensability of Halakha&quot;, stating that &quot;&quot;Halakha&quot; in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern.&quot; Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition, charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.

The tension between &quot;tradition and change&quot;—which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s—and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages, the leadership opposed pronounced innovation, mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. Mordecai Kaplan&#x27;s Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or &quot;Halakhic&quot; considerations, but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s, when Kaplan&#x27;s influence grew, his superiors rabbis Louis Ginzberg, Louis Finkelstein and Saul Lieberman espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s, with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the movement, the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct, but rejected the Reconstructionist &quot;Non-Halakhic&quot; approach, insisting that the legalistic method be maintained. The &quot;Halakhic&quot; commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism, from within and without. Right-wing discontents, including the Union for Traditional Judaism which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis—adopted at an open vote, where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted—contested the validity of this description, as well as progressives like Rabbi Neil Gillman, who exhorted the movement to cease describing itself as &quot;Halakhic&quot; in 2005, stating that after repeated concessions, &quot;Our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning.&quot;

The main body entrusted with formulating rulings, responsa and statues is the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller &quot;Va&#x27;ad ha-Halakha&quot; (Law Committee) of Israel&#x27;s Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of &quot;halakhic&quot; pluralism, enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi, the &quot;Mara D&#x27;Atra&quot; (Lord of the Locality, in traditional terms), enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus, on the issue of admitting openly homosexual rabbinic candidates, the Committee approved two resolutions, one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position, while the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano still adheres to the latter. Likewise, while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life, some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count females for prayer quorums.

The Conservative treatment of &quot;Halakha&quot; is defined by several features, though the entire range of its &quot;Halakhic&quot; discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the Traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi David Golinkin, who attempted to classify its parameters, stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. For example, in the details of preparing Sabbath ritual enclosures, it draws directly on the opinions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi. Another tendency prevalent among the movement&#x27;s rabbis, yet again not particular to it, is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question—though this is not universal, and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.

A more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources, in the &quot;Rishonim&quot; or before them, as far back as the Talmud. Conservative decisors frequently resort to less canonical sources, isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature, mainly those by the later authorities, and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (&quot;machloket&quot;) with old rulings, to be flexible towards custom or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law, like &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; and especially the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; with its Isserles Gloss and later commentaries. Conservative authorities, while often relying on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; themselves, criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi Joseph Karo&#x27;s work. In several occasions, Conservative rabbis discerned that the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; ruled without firm precedent, sometimes deriving his conclusions from the &quot;Kabbalah&quot;. An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin—contrary to the majority consensus among the &quot;Acharonim&quot; and the more prominent &quot;Rishonim&quot;, but based on many opinions of the lesser &quot;Rishonim&quot; which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud—that the Sabbatical Year is not obligatory in present times at all (neither &quot;de&#x27;Oraita&quot; nor &quot;de&#x27;Rabanan&quot;) but rather an act of piety.

Ethical considerations and the weight due to them in determining &quot;halakhic&quot; issues, mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome, are subject to much discourse. Right-wing decisors, like Rabbi Joel Roth, maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions, but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority, however, basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi Seymour Siegel in the 1960s, that the cultural and ethical norms of the community, the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic &quot;Aggadah&quot;, should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox, Conservative Judaism maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: &quot;In other words, the &quot;Aggadah&quot; should control the &quot;Halakha&quot;.&quot; The liberal Rabbi Gordon Tucker, along with Gillman and other progressives, supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach, making Conservative Judaism much more &quot;Aggadic&quot; and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation, but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals, the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance, but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations, including on other forms of sexual relations, were lifted. A similar approach is manifest in the great weight ascribed to sociological changes in deciding religious policy. The CJLS and the Rabbinical Assembly members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times, fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like &quot;Shinui ha-I&#x27;ttim&quot;, &quot;Change of Times&quot;). This, along with the ethical aspect, was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.

The most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse, in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy, is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand, from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced, accepted, rejected or modified in various periods, not necessarily in sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology, philology and Judaic Studies are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts, sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling, grammar and transcription errors, changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement, for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned, and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields, like veterinarian publications in &quot;Halakhic&quot; matters concerning livestock.

Conservative authorities, as part of their promulgation of a dynamic &quot;Halakha&quot;, often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statutes (&quot;Takkanah&quot;) that enabled the bypassing of prohibitions in the Pentateuch, like the &quot;Prozbul&quot; or &quot;Heter I&#x27;ska&quot;. In 1948, when employing those was first debated, Rabbi Isaac Klein argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel, formulation of significant &quot;takkanot&quot; should be avoided. Another proposal, to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA, was rejected. New statues require a simple majority, 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s, such drastic measures—as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees, &quot;Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope, thereby weakening the entire &quot;halakhic&quot; structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate&quot;—were carefully drafted as temporal, emergency ordinances (&quot;Horaat Sha&#x27;ah&quot;), grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on, these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new, thoroughgoing statues, from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a &quot;mamzer&quot;, de facto abolishing this legal category.

===Rulings and policies===
The RA and CJLS reached many decisions through the years, shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s, when the public demanded mixed seating of both sexes in synagogue, some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the ground of dire need (Eth la&#x27;asot), others noted that archaeological research showed no partitions in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations. In 1950, it was ruled that using electricity (that is, closure of an electrical circuit) did not constitute kindling a fire unto itself, not even in incandescent bulbs, and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis, while performing banned labours is of course forbidden—for example, video recording is still constituted as writing—switching lights and other functions are allowed, though the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays, like loud noise reminiscent of work).

The need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS, during the same year, to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day, for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the Tabernacle, and could therefore be classified, according to their interpretation of the Tosafists&#x27; opinion, as &quot;redundant labour&quot; (&quot;Sh’eina Tzricha L’gufa&quot;) and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the movement. In 1952, members of the priestly caste were allowed to marry divorcees, conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges, as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967, the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.

In 1954, the issue of &quot;agunot&quot; (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the prenuptial contract under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968, this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the bride price, rendering the marriage void. In 1955, more girls were celebrating Bat Mitzvah and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah, the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (&quot;Kvod ha&#x27;Tzibur&quot;) was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that rennet, even if derived from unclean animals, was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (&quot;Panim Chadashot ba&#x27;u l&#x27;Khan&quot;) and therefore all hard cheese could be considered kosher.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women&#x27;s rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum, based on the argument that only the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted, this was very controversial in the Committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi Joel Roth, and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted, and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others), especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the Counting of the Omer. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera, and his responsa was adopted. Since then, female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994, the movement accepted Judith Hauptman&#x27;s principally egalitarian argument, according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006, openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012, a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised, though not defined as &quot;kiddushin&quot;. In 2016, the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.

Conservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent, as in the Reform movement, were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However, as the rate of such unions rose dramatically, Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as &quot;K&#x27;rov Yisrael&quot; (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: &quot;we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.&quot;

Despite the centralization of legal deliberation on matters of Jewish law in the CJLS individual synagogues and communities must, in the end, depend on their local decision-makers. The rabbi in his or her or their community is regarded as the &quot;Mara D&#x27;Atra&quot;, or the local &quot;Halakhic&quot; decisor. Rabbis trained in the reading practices of Conservative Jewish approaches, historical evaluation of Jewish law and interpretation of Biblical and Rabbinic texts may align directly with the CJLS decisions or themselves opine on matters based on precedents or readings of text that shine light on congregants&#x27; questions. So, for instance, a rabbi may or may not choose to permit video streaming on Shabbat despite a majority ruling that allows for use of electronics. A local &quot;Mara D&#x27;Atra&quot; may rely on the reasoning found in the majority or minority opinions of the CJLS or have other textual and halakhic grounds, i.e., prioritizing Jewish values or legal concepts, to rule one way or another on matters of ritual, family life or sacred pursuits. This balance between a centralization of &quot;Halakhic&quot; authority and maintaining the authority of local rabbis reflects the commitment to pluralism at the heart of the Movement.

==Organization and demographics==
The term &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; was used, still generically and not yet as a specific label, already in the 1887 dedication speech of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America by Rabbi Alexander Kohut. By 1901, the JTS alumni formed the Rabbinical Assembly, of which all ordained Conservative clergy in the world are members. As of 2010, there were 1,648 rabbis in the RA. In 1913, the United Synagogue of America, renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991, was founded as a congregational arm of the RA. The movement established the World Council of Conservative Synagogues in 1957. Offshoots outside North America mostly adopted the Hebrew name &quot;Masorti&quot; (&quot;traditional&quot;), as did the Israeli Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, and the British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, formed in 1985. The World Council eventually changed its primary designation to &quot;Masorti Olami.&quot; Besides the RA, the international Cantors Assembly supplies prayer leaders for congregations worldwide.

The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, covering the United States, Canada and Mexico, is by far the largest constituent of Masorti Olami. While most congregations defining themselves as &quot;Conservative&quot; are affiliated with the USCJ, some are independent. While accurate information of Canada is scant, it is estimated that some third of religiously affiliated Canadian Jews are Conservative. In 2008, the more traditional Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues seceded from the parent organization. It numbered seven communities as of 2014. According to the Pew Research Center survey in 2013, 18 per cent of Jews in the United States and in 2020 13 per cent identified with the movement, making it the second largest in the country. Steven M. Cohen calculated that as of 2013, 962,000 U.S. Jewish adults considered themselves Conservative: 570,000 were registered congregants and further 392,000 were not members in a synagogue but identified. In addition, Cohen assumed in 2006 that 57,000 unconverted non-Jewish spouses were also registered (12 per cent of member households had one at the time): 40 per cent of members intermarry. Conservatives are also the most aged group: among those aged under 30 only 11 per cent identified as such, and there are three people over 55 for every single one aged between 35 and 44. As of November 2015, the USCJ had 580 member congregations (a sharp decline from 630 two years prior), 19 in Canada and the remainder in the United States. In 2011 the USCJ initiated a plan to reinvigorate the movement.

Beyond North America, the movement has little presence—in 2011, Rela Mintz Geffen appraised there were only 100,000 members outside the U.S. (and the former figure including Canada). &quot;Masorti AmLat&quot;, the MO branch in Latin America, is the largest with 35 communities in Argentina, 7 in Brazil, 6 in Chile and further 11 in the other countries. The British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues has 13 communities and estimates its membership at over 4,000. More than 20 communities are spread across Europe, and there are 3 in Australia and 2 in Africa. The Masorti Movement in Israel incorporates some 70 communities and prayer groups with several thousand full members. In addition, while Hungarian Neolog Judaism, with a few thousands of adherents and forty partially active synagogues, is not officially affiliated with Masorti Olami, Conservative Judaism regards it as a fraternal, &quot;non-Orthodox but halakhic&quot; movement.

In New York, the JTS serves as the movement&#x27;s original seminary and legacy institution, along with the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles; the Marshall T. Meyer Latin American Rabbinical Seminary (Spanish: &quot;Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano Marshall T. Meyer&quot;), in Buenos Aires, Argentina; and the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. A Conservative institution that does not grant rabbinic ordination but which runs along the lines of a traditional yeshiva is the Conservative Yeshiva, located in Jerusalem. The Neolog Budapest University of Jewish Studies also maintains connections with Conservative Judaism.

The current chancellor of the JTS is Shuly Rubin Schwartz, in office since 2020. She is the first woman elected to this position in the history of JTS. The current dean of the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies is Bradley Shavit Artson. The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards is chaired by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, serving since 2007. The Rabbinical Assembly is headed by President Rabbi Debra Newman Kamin, as of 2019, and managed by Chief Executive Officer, Rabbi Jacob Blumenthal. Rabbi Blumenthal holds the joint position as CEO of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The current USCJ President is Ned Gladstein. In South America, Rabbi Ariel Stofenmacher serves as chancellor in the Seminary and Rabbi Marcelo Rittner as president of Masorti AmLat. In Britain, the Masorti Assembly is chaired by Senior Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg. In Israel, the Masorti movement&#x27;s executive director is Yizhar Hess and chair Sophie Fellman Rafalovitz.

The global youth movement is known as NOAM, an acronym for No&#x27;ar Masorti; its North American organization is called United Synagogue Youth. Marom Israel is the Masorti movement&#x27;s organization for students and young adults, providing activities based on religious pluralism and Jewish content. The Women&#x27;s League for Conservative Judaism is also active in North America.

The USCJ maintains the Solomon Schechter Day Schools, comprising 76 day schools in 17 American states and 2 Canadian provinces serving Jewish children. Many other &quot;community day schools&quot; that are not affiliated with Schechter take a generally Conservative approach, but unlike these, generally have &quot;no barriers to enrollment based on the faith of the parents or on religious practices in the home&quot;. During the first decade of the 21st century, a number of schools that were part of the Schechter network transformed themselves into non-affiliated community day schools. The USCJ also maintains the Camp Ramah system, where children and adolescents spend summers in an observant environment.

==History==
===Positive-Historical School===

The rise of modern, centralized states in Europe by the early 19th century heralded the end of Jewish judicial autonomy and social seclusion. Their communal corporate rights were abolished, and the process of emancipation and acculturation that followed quickly transformed the values and norms of the public. Estrangement and apathy toward Judaism were rampant. The process of communal, educational and civil reform could not be restricted from affecting the core tenets of the faith. The new academic, critical study of Judaism (&quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot;) soon became a source of controversy. Rabbis and scholars argued to what degree, if at all, its findings could be used to determine present conduct. The modernized Orthodox in Germany, like rabbis Isaac Bernays and Azriel Hildesheimer, were content to cautiously study it while stringently adhering to the sanctity of holy texts and refusing to grant &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; any say in religious matters. On the other extreme were Rabbi Abraham Geiger, who would emerge as the founding father of Reform Judaism, and his supporters. They opposed any limit on critical research or its practical application, laying more weight on the need for change than on continuity.

The Prague-born Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, appointed chief rabbi of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1836, gradually rose to become the leader of those who stood at the middle. Besides working for the civic betterment of local Jews and educational reform, he displayed keen interest in &quot;Wissenschaft&quot;. But Frankel was always cautious and deeply reverent towards tradition, privately writing in 1836 that &quot;The means must be applied with such care and discretion... that forward progress will be reached unnoticed, and seem inconsequential to the average spectator.&quot; He soon found himself embroiled in the great disputes of the 1840s. In 1842, during the second Hamburg Temple controversy, he opposed the new Reform prayerbook, arguing the elimination of petitions for a future Return to Zion led by the Messiah was a violation of an ancient tenet. But he also opposed the ban placed on the tome by Rabbi Bernays, stating this was a primitive behaviour. In the same year, he and the moderate conservative S.L. Rapoport were the only ones of nineteen respondents who negatively answered the Breslau community&#x27;s enquiry on whether the deeply unorthodox Geiger could serve there. In 1843, Frankel clashed with the radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim, who argued that the act of marriage in Judaism was a civic (&quot;memonot&quot;) rather than sanctified () matter and could be subject to the Law of the Land. In December 1843 Frankel launched the magazine &quot;Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums&quot;. In the preamble, he attempted to present his approach to the present plight: &quot;The further development of Judaism cannot be done through Reform that would lead to total dissipation... But must be involved in its study... pursued via scientific research, on a &quot;positive, historical&quot; basis.&quot; The term Positive-Historical became associated with him and his middle way. The &quot;Zeitschrift&quot; was, along the convictions of its publisher, neither dogmatically orthodox nor overly polemic, wholly opposing Biblical criticism and arguing for the antiquity of custom and practice.

In 1844, Geiger and like-minded allies arranged a conference in Braunschweig that was to have enough authority (since 1826, Rabbi Aaron Chorin called for the convocation of a new &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;) to debate and enact thoroughgoing revisions. Frankel was willing to agree only to a meeting without any practical results, and refused the invitation. When the protocols, which contained many radical statements, were published, he denounced the assembly for &quot;applying the scalpel of criticism&quot; and favouring the spirit of the age over tradition. However, he later agreed to attend the second conference, held in Frankfurt am Main on 15 July 1845—in spite of warnings from Rapoport, who cautioned that compromise with Geiger was impossible and he would only damage his reputation among the traditionalists. On the 16th, the issue of Hebrew in the liturgy arose. Most present were inclined to retain it, but with more German segments. A small majority adopted a resolution stating there were subjective, but no objective, imperatives to keep it as the language of service. Frankel then astounded his peers by vehemently protesting, stating it was a breach with the past and that Hebrew was of dire importance and great sentimental value. The others immediately began quoting all passages in rabbinic literature allowing prayer in the vernacular. Frankel could not contend with the &quot;halakhic&quot; validity of their decision, but he perceived it as a sign of profound differences between them. On the 17th he formally withdrew, publishing a lambasting critique of the procedures. &quot;Opponents of the conference, who feared he went to the other side,&quot; noted historian Michael A. Meyer, &quot;now felt reassured of his loyalty&quot;.

The rabbi of Saxony had many sympathizers, who supported a similarly moderate approach and change only on the basis of the authority of the Talmud. When Geiger began preparing a third conference in Breslau, Hirsch Bär Fassel convinced Frankel to organize one of his own in protest. Frankel invited colleagues to an assembly in Dresden, which was to be held on 21 October 1846. He announced that one measure he was willing to countenance was the possible abolition of the second day of festivals, though only if a broad consensus will be reached and not before thorough deliberation. Attendants were to include Rapoport, Fassel, Adolf Jellinek, Leopold Löw, Michael Sachs, Abraham Kohn and others. However, the Dresden assembly soon drew heated Orthodox resistance, especially from Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, and was postponed indefinitely.

In 1854, Frankel was appointed chancellor in the new Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, the first modern rabbinical seminary in Germany. His opponents on both flanks were incensed. Geiger and the Reform camp long accused him of theological ambiguity, hypocrisy and attachment to stagnant remnants, and now protested the &quot;medieval&quot; atmosphere in the seminary, which was mainly concerned with teaching Jewish Law. The hardline Orthodox Samson Raphael Hirsch, who fiercely opposed &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; and emphasized the divine origin of the entire &quot;halakhic&quot; system in the Theophany at Sinai, was deeply suspicious of Frankel&#x27;s beliefs, use of science and constant assertions that Jewish Law was flexible and evolving.

The final schism between Frankel and the Orthodox occurred after the 1859 publication of his &quot;Darke ha-Mishna&quot; (Ways of the Mishna). He heaved praise on the Beatified Sages, presenting them as bold innovators, but not once affirmed the divinity of the Oral Torah. On the ordinances classified as Law given to Moses at Sinai, he quoted Asher ben Jehiel that stated several of those were only apocryphally dubbed as such; he applied the latter&#x27;s conclusion to all, noting they were &quot;so evident &quot;as if&quot; given at Sinai&quot;. Hirsch branded Frankel a heretic, demanding he announce whether he believed that both the Oral and Written Torah were of celestial origin. Rabbis Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, Solomon Klein and others published more complaisant tracts, but also requested an explanation. Rapoport marshaled to Frankel&#x27;s aid, assuring that his words were merely reiterating ben Jehiel&#x27;s and that he would soon release a statement that will belie Hirsch&#x27;s accusations. But then the Chancellor of Breslau issued an ambiguous defence, writing that his book was not concerned with theology and avoiding giving any clear answer. Now even Rapoport joined his critics.

Hirsch succeeded, severely tarnishing Frankel&#x27;s reputation among most concerned. Along with fellow Orthodox Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer, Hirsch launched a protracted public campaign through the 1860s. They ceaselessly stressed the chasm between an Orthodox understanding of &quot;Halakha&quot; as derived and revealed, applied differently to different circumstances and subject to human judgement and possibly error, yet unchanging and divine in principle—as opposed to an evolutionary, historicist and non-dogmatic approach in which past authorities were not just elaborating but consciously innovating, as taught by Frankel. Hildesheimer often repeated that this issue utterly overshadowed any specific technical argument with the Breslau School (the students of which were often more lenient on matters of headcovering for women, Chalav Yisrael and other issues). Hildesheimer was concerned that Jewish public opinion perceived no practical difference between them; though he cared to distinguish the observant acolytes of Frankel from the Reform camp, he noted in his diary: &quot;How meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer.&quot; In 1863, when Breslau faculty member Heinrich Graetz published an article where he appeared to doubt the Messianic belief, Hildesheimer immediately seized upon the occasion to prove once more the dogmatic, rather than practical, divide. He denounced Graetz as a heretic.

The Positive-Historical School was influential, but never institutionalized itself as thoroughly as its opponents. Apart from the many graduates of Breslau, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Adolf Jellinek and Rabbi Moritz Güdemann led the central congregation in Vienna along a similar path. In Jellinek&#x27;s local seminary, Meir Friedmann and Isaac Hirsch Weiss followed Frankel&#x27;s moderate approach to critical research. The rabbinate of the liberal Neolog public in Hungary, which formally separated from the Orthodox, was also permeated with the &quot;Breslau spirit&quot;. Many of its members studied there, and its Jewish Theological Seminary of Budapest was modeled after it, though the assimilationist congregants cared little for rabbinic opinion. In Germany itself, Breslau alumni founded in 1868 a short-lived society, the Jüdisch-Theologische Verein. It was dissolved within a year, boycotted by both Reform and Orthodox. Michael Sachs led the Berlin congregation in a very conservative style, eventually resigning when an organ was introduced in services. Manuel Joël, another of the Frankelist party, succeeded Geiger in Breslau. He maintained his predecessor&#x27;s truncated German translation of the liturgy for the sake of compromise, but restored the full Hebrew text.

The Breslau Seminary and the Reform Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums maintained very different approaches; but on the communal level, the former&#x27;s alumni failure to organize or articulate a coherent agenda, coupled with the declining prestige of Breslau and the conservatism of the Hochschule&#x27;s alumni—a necessity in heterogeneous communities which remained unified, especially after the Orthodox gained the right to secede in 1876—imposed a rather uniform and mild character on what was known in Germany as &quot;Liberal Judaism&quot;. In 1909, 63 rabbis associated with the Breslau approach founded the Freie Jüdische Vereinigung, another brief attempt at institutionalization, but it too failed soon. Only in 1925 did the Religiöse Mittelpartei für Frieden und Einheit succeed in driving the same agenda. It won several seats in communal elections, but was small and of little influence.

===Jewish Theological Seminary===

Jewish immigration to the United States bred an amalgam of loose communities, lacking strong tradition or stable structures. In this free-spirited environment, a multitude of forces was at work. As early as 1866, Rabbi Jonas Bondi of New York wrote that a Judaism of the &quot;golden middleway, which was termed Orthodox by the left and heterodox or reformer by the right&quot; developed in the new country. The rapid ascendancy of Reform Judaism by the 1880s left few who opposed it, merely a handful of congregations and ministers remained outside the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. These included Sabato Morais and Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes of the elitist Sephardi congregations, along with rabbis Bernard Drachman (ordained at Breslau, though he regarded himself as Orthodox) and Henry Schneeberger.

While spearheaded by radical and principled Reformers like Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, the UAHC was also home to more conservative elements. President Isaac Meyer Wise, a pragmatist intent on compromise, hoped to forge a broad consensus that would turn a moderate version of Reform to dominant in America. He kept the dietary laws at home and attempted to assuage traditionalists. On 11 July 1883, apparently due to negligence by the Jewish caterer, non-kosher dishes were served to UAHC rabbis in Wise&#x27;s presence. Known to posterity as the &quot;trefa banquet&quot;, it purportedly made some guests abandon the hall in disgust, but little is factually known about the incident. In 1885, the traditionalist forces were bolstered upon the arrival of Rabbi Alexander Kohut, an adherent of Frankel. He publicly excoriated Reform for disdaining ritual and received forms, triggering a heated polemic with Kohler. The debate was one of the main factors which motivated the latter to compose the Pittsburgh Platform, which unambiguously declared the principles of Reform Judaism: &quot;to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.&quot;

The explicit wording alienated a handful of conservative UAHC ministers: Henry Hochheimer, Frederick de Sola Mendes, Aaron Wise, Marcus Jastrow, and Benjamin Szold. They joined Kohut, Morais and the others in seeking to establish a traditional rabbinic seminary that would serve as a counterweight to Hebrew Union College. In 1886, they founded the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City. Kohut, professor of Talmud who held to the Positive-Historical ideal, was the main educational influence in the early years, prominent among the founders who encompassed the entire spectrum from progressive Orthodox to the brink of Reform; to describe what the seminary intended to espouse, he used the term &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot;, which had no independent meaning at the time and was only in relation to Reform. In 1898, Pereira Mendes, Schneeberger and Drachman also founded the Orthodox Union, which maintained close ties with the seminary.

The JTS was a small, fledgling institution with financial difficulties, and was ordaining merely a rabbi per year. But soon after Chancellor Morais&#x27; death in 1897, its fortunes turned. Since 1881, a wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was inundating the country—by 1920, 2.5 million of them had arrived, increasing American Jewry tenfold. They came from regions where civil equality or emancipation were never granted, while acculturation and modernization made little headway. Whether devout or irreligious, they mostly retained strong traditional sentiments in matters of faith, accustomed to old-style rabbinate; the hardline Agudas HaRabbanim, founded by emigrant clergy, opposed secular education or vernacular sermons, and its members spoke almost only Yiddish. The Eastern Europeans were alienated by the local Jews, who were all assimilated in comparison, and especially aghast by the mores of Reform. The need to find a religious framework that would both accommodate and Americanize them motivated Jacob Schiff and other rich philanthropists, all Reform and of German descent, to donate $500,000 to the JTS. The contribution was solicited by Professor Cyrus Adler. It was conditioned on the appointment of Solomon Schechter as Chancellor. In 1901, the Rabbinical Assembly was established as the fraternity of JTS alumni.

Schechter arrived in 1902, and at once reorganized the faculty, dismissing both Pereira Mendes and Drachman for lack of academic merit. Under his aegis, the institute began to draw famous scholars, becoming a center of learning on par with HUC. Schechter was both traditional in sentiment and quite unorthodox in conviction. He maintained that theology was of little importance and it was practice that must be preserved. He aspired to solicit unity in American Judaism, denouncing sectarianism and not perceiving himself as leading a new denomination: &quot;not to create a new party, but to consolidate an old one&quot;. The need to raise funds convinced him that a congregational arm for the Rabbinical Assembly and the JTS was required. On 23 February 1913, he founded the United Synagogue of America (since 1991: United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), which then consisted of 22 communities. He and Mendes first came to major disagreement; Schechter insisted that any alumnus could be appointed to the USoA&#x27;s managerial board, and not just to serve as communal rabbi, including several the latter did not consider sufficiently devout, or who tolerated mixed seating in their synagogues (though some of those he still regarded as Orthodox). Mendes, president of the Orthodox Union, therefore refused to join. He began to distinguish between the &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot; of himself and his peers in the OU, and &quot;Conservatives&quot; who tolerated what was beyond the pale for him. However, this first sign of institutionalization and separation was far from conclusive. Mendes himself could not clearly differentiate between the two groups, and many he viewed as Orthodox were members of the USoA. The epithets &quot;Conservative&quot; and &quot;Orthodox&quot; remained interchangeable for decades to come. JTS graduates served in OU congregations; many students of the Orthodox Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and members of the OU&#x27;s Rabbinical Council of America, or RCA, attended it. In 1926, RIETS and the JTS even negotiated a possible merger, though it was never materialized. Upon Schechter&#x27;s death in 1915, the first generation of his disciples kept his non-sectarian legacy of striving for a united, traditional American Judaism. He was replaced by Cyrus Adler.

The USoA grew rapidly as the Eastern European immigrant population slowly integrated. In 1923 it already had 150 affiliated communities, and 229 before 1930. Synagogues offered a more modernized ritual: English sermons, choir singing, late Friday evening services which tacitly acknowledging that most had to work until after the Sabbath began, and often mixed-gender seating. Men and women sat separately with no partition, and some houses of prayer already introduced family pews. Motivated by popular pressure and frowned upon by both RA and seminary faculty—in its own synagogue, the institute maintained a partition until 1983—this was becoming common among the OU as well. As both social conditions and apathy turned American Jews away from tradition (barely 20 per cent were attending prayers weekly), a young professor named Mordecai Kaplan promoted the idea of transforming the synagogue into a community center, a &quot;Shul with a Pool&quot;, a policy which indeed stymied the tide somewhat.

In 1927, the RA also established its own Committee of Jewish Law, entrusted with determining &quot;halakhic&quot; issues. Consisting of seven members, it was chaired by the traditionalist Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, who already distinguished himself in 1922, drafting a responsa that allowed the use of grape juice rather than fermented wine for &quot;Kiddush&quot; on the background of Prohibition. Kaplan himself, who rose to become an influential and popular figure within the JTS, concluded that his fellow rabbis&#x27; ambiguity in matters of belief and the contradiction between full observance and critical study were untenable and hypocritical. He formulated his own approach of Judaism as a Civilization, rejecting the concept of Revelation and any supernatural belief in favour of a cultural-ethnic perception. While valuing received mores, he eventually suggested giving the past &quot;a vote, not a veto&quot;. Though popular among students, Kaplan&#x27;s nascent Reconstructionism was opposed by the new traditionalist Chancellor Louis Finkelstein, appointed in 1940, and a large majority among the faculty.

Tensions within the JTS and RA grew. The Committee of Jewish Law consisted mainly of scholars who had little field experience, almost solely from the seminary&#x27;s Talmudic department. They were greatly concerned with &quot;halakhic&quot; licitness and indifferent to the pressures exerted on the pulpit rabbis, who had to contend with an Americanized public which cared little for such considerations or for tradition in general. In 1935, the RA almost adopted a groundbreaking motion: Rabbi Louis Epstein offered a solution to the agunah predicament, a clause that would have had husbands appoint wives as their proxies to issue divorce. It was repealed under pressure from the Orthodox Union. As late as 1947, CJL Chair Rabbi Boaz Cohen, himself a historicist who argued that the Law evolved much through time, rebuked pulpit clergy who requested lenient or radical rulings, stating he and his peers were content to &quot;progress in inches... Free setting up of new premises and the introduction of novel categories of ritual upon the basis of pure reason and thinking would be perilous, if not fatal, to the principles and continuity of Jewish Law.&quot;

===A third movement===
The boundaries between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in America were institutionalized only in the aftermath of World War II. The 1940s saw the younger generation of JTS graduates less patient with the prudence of the CJL and Talmud faculty in face of popular demand. Kaplan&#x27;s Reconstructionism, while its fully committed partisans were few, had much influence. The majority among recent alumni eschewed the epithet &quot;Orthodox&quot; and tended to employ &quot;Conservative&quot; exclusively. Succeeding Schechter&#x27;s direct disciples who headed the RA, JTS and United Synagogue in the interwar period, a new strata of activist leaders was rising. Rabbi Robert Gordis, RA president in 1944–1946, represented the junior members in advocating more flexibility; Rabbi Jacob Agus, a RIETS graduate who joined the body only in 1945, clamored that &quot;we need a law making body, not a law interpreting committee.&quot; Agus argued that the breach between the Jewish public and tradition was too wide to be bridged conventionally, and that the RA would always remain inferior to the Orthodox as long as it retained its policy of merely adopting lenient precedents in rabbinic literature. He offered to extensively apply the tool of &quot;takkanah&quot;, rabbinic ordinance.
In 1946, a committee chaired by Gordis issued the &quot;Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook&quot;, the first clearly Conservative liturgy: references to the sacrificial cult were in the past tense instead of a petition for restoration, and it rephrased blessings such as &quot;who hast made me according to thy will&quot; for women to &quot;who hast made me a woman&quot;. During the movement&#x27;s national conference in Chicago, held 13–17 May 1948, the pulpit rabbis in the RA gained the upper hand. Spurred by Gordis, Agus and fellow leaders, they voted to reorganize the CJL into a Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, enfranchised to issue &quot;takkanot&quot; by a majority. Membership was conditioned on having experience as a congregational rabbi, and unseasoned JTS faculty were thus denied entrance. While the RA was asserting a Conservative distinctive identity, the seminary remained more cautious. Finkelstein opposed sectarianism and preferred the neutral epithet &quot;traditional&quot;, later commenting that &quot;Conservative Judaism is a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism&quot;. He and the very right-wing Talmud professor Saul Lieberman, who maintained ties with the Orthodox while also viewing them as obstructionist and ossified, dominated the JTS, providing a counterweight to the liberals in the Assembly. Kaplan, meanwhile, spent more time on consolidating his Society for Advancement of Judaism. Abraham Joshua Heschel, who espoused a mysticist understanding of Jewish religion, also became an important figure among the faculty.

The CJLS now proceeded to demonstrate its independence. Sabbath was widely desecrated by a large majority of Jews, and the board believed attendance at synagogues should be encouraged. They therefore enacted an ordinance that allowed driving on the Sabbath (for worship alone) and the use of electricity. The driving responsum was later severely criticized by Conservative rabbis, and was charged with imparting that the movement was overly keen to condone the laxity of congregants. It also signified the final break with the Orthodox, who were themselves being bolstered by more strictly observant immigrants from Europe. In 1954, the RCA reversed its 1948 ruling that allowed the use of microphones on Sabbath and festivals and declared that praying without a partition between sexes was banned. Though enforced slowly—in 1997, there were still seven OU congregations with no physical barrier, and so-called &quot;Conservadox&quot; remain extant—these two attributes became a demarcation line between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues. RA converts were denied ablution in Orthodox ritual baths, and rabbis from one movement would gradually cease serving in the other&#x27;s communities.

Rather than a force within American Judaism, the JTS-centered movement emerged as a third movement. The historicist and critical approach to &quot;halakha&quot;, as well as other features, were emphasized by leaders eager to demonstrate their uniqueness. In their efforts to solidify a coherent identity, Conservative thinkers like Mordecai Waxman in his 1957 &quot;Tradition and Change&quot;, ventured beyond Schechter&#x27;s conceptions to Rabbi Zecharias Frankel and Breslau, presenting themselves as its direct inheritors via Alexander Kohut and others. The CJLS continued to issue groundbreaking ordinances and rulings.
The postwar decades were a time of immense growth for the Conservative movement. Most of the 500,000 decommissioned Jewish GIs left the densely populated immigrant neighbourhoods of the East Coast, moving to suburbia. They were Americanized but still retained traditional sentiments, and Reform Judaism was too radical for most. The United Synagogue of America offered Jewish education for children and a familiar religious environment which was also comfortable and not strict. It expanded from 350 communities by 1945 to 832 by 1971, becoming the largest denomination, with some 350,000 dues-paying member households (1.5 million people) at synagogues and over 40 per cent of American Jewry identifying with it in polls, adding an estimated million more non-registered supporters.

Already in a 1955 study, Marshall Sklare defined Conservative Judaism as the quintessential American Jewish movement, but stressed the gap between laity and clergy, noting &quot;rabbis now recognize that they are not making decisions or writing responsa, but merely taking a poll of their membership.&quot; Most congregants, commented Edward S. Shapiro, were &quot;Conservative Jews because their rabbi kept kosher and the Sabbath... Not because of their religious behavior.&quot; The movement established its presence outside the U.S. and Canada: In 1962, the young Rabbi Marshall Meyer founded the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires, which would serve as the basis for Conservative expansion in South America. In 1979, four communities formed the Israel Masorti Movement. Rabbi Louis Jacobs, dismissed in 1964 from the British Orthodox rabbinate on the charge of heresy after espousing a non-literal understanding of the Torah, joined with the Conservatives and founded his country&#x27;s first Masorti community. The new branches were all united within the World Council of Synagogues, later to be named Masorti Olami.

The movement peaked in numbers in the 1970s. During that decade, the tensions between the various elements within it intensified. The right wing, conservative in &quot;halakhic&quot; matters and often adhering to a verbal understanding of revelation, was dismayed by the failure to bolster observance among the laity and the resurgence of Orthodoxy. The left was influenced by the Reconstructionists, who formed their own seminary in 1968 and were slowly coalescing, as well as the growing appeal of Reform, which turned more traditional and threatened to sway congregants. While the rightists opposed further modifications, their left-wing peers demanded them. The Chavurah movement, consisting of nonaligned prayer quorums of young (and frequently, Conservative-raised) worshipers who sought a more intense religious experience, also weakened congregations. In 1972, the liberal wing gained an influential position with the appointment of Gerson D. Cohen as JTS Chancellor. During the same year, after Reform began to ordain female rabbis, a strong lobby rose to advocate the same. The CJLS rapidly enacted an ordinance which allowed women to be tallied for a &quot;minyan&quot;, and by 1976 the percentage of synagogues allowing them to bless during the reading of the Torah grew from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. In 1979, ignoring the denominational leadership, Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County accepted the RRC-ordained Rabbi Linda Joy Holtzman. Pressures to allow women to assume rabbinical positions was mounting from the congregational level, though the RA agreed to delay any action until the JTS scholars would concur.

Female ordination was a matter of great friction until 1983, when Rabbi Joel Roth devised a solution that entailed women voluntarily accepting the obligation to pray regularly. The leadership passed it not by scholarly consensus but via a popular vote of all JTS faculty, including non-specialists. Two years later, the first JTS-ordained female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, was admitted into the RA. David Weiss Halivni, professor of the Talmud faculty, claimed that Roth&#x27;s method must have required waiting until a considerable number of women did prove sufficient commitment. He and his sympathizers regarded the vote as belying any claim to &quot;halakhic&quot; integrity. They formed the Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism in 1985, a right-wing lobby which numbered some 10,000 supporters from the Conservative observant elite. The UTJC withdrew from the movement and erased the word &quot;Conservative&quot; in 1990, attempting to merge with moderate Orthodox organizations.

In the very same year, the Reconstructionist also seceded fully, joining the World Union for Progressive Judaism under observer status. The double defection narrowed the movement&#x27;s spectrum of opinions, at a time when large swaths of congregants were abandoning in favour of Reform, which was more tolerant of intermarriage. RA leaders were engaged in introspection through the later 1980s, resulting in the 1988 &quot;Emet ve-Emunah&quot; platform, while Reform slowly bypassed them and became the largest American Jewish movement.

After the issue of egalitarianism for women subsided, LGBT acceptance replaced it as the main source of contention between the declining right wing and the liberal majority. A first attempt was rebuffed in 1992 by a harsh responsum written by Roth. The retirement of Chancellor Ismar Schorsch, a staunch opponent, allowed the CJLS to endorse a motion which still banned anal intercourse but not any other physical contact, and allowed the ordination of openly LGBT rabbis, in 2006. Roth and three other supporters resigned from the panel in protest, claiming the responsum was not valid; Masorti affiliates in South America, Israel and Hungary objected severely. The Seminario is yet to accept the resolution, while several Canadian congregations seceded from the United Synagogue in 2008 to form an independent union in protest of the slide to the left. Since the 2013 Pew survey, which assessed that only 18 per cent of American Jews identify with it, Conservative leadership is engaged in attempting to solve Conservative Judaism&#x27;s demographic crisis.

<text>The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) is a desktop environment for Unix and OpenVMS, based on the Motif widget toolkit. It was part of the UNIX 98 Workstation Product Standard, and was for a long time the Unix desktop associated with commercial Unix workstations. It helped to influence early implementations of successor projects such as KDE and GNOME, which largely replaced CDE following the turn of the century.

After a long history as proprietary software, CDE was released as free software on August 6, 2012, under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.0 or later. Since its release as free software, CDE has been ported to Linux and BSD derivatives.

== History ==
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, SunSoft, and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. Each development group contributed its own technology to CDE:

* HP contributed the primary environment for CDE, which was based on HP&#x27;s Visual User Environment (VUE). HP VUE was itself derived from the Motif Window Manager.
* IBM contributed its Common User Access model from OS/2&#x27;s Workplace Shell.
* Sun contributed its ToolTalk application interaction framework and a port of its DeskSet productivity tools, including mail and calendar clients, from its OpenWindows environment.
* USL provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from UNIX System V.

After its release, HP endorsed CDE as the new standard desktop for Unix, and provided documentation and software for migrating HP VUE customizations to CDE.

In March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the &quot;new OSF&quot;, a merger of the Open Software Foundation and Unix International;
in September 1995, the merger of Motif and CDE into a single project, CDE/Motif, was announced. OSF became part of the newly formed Open Group in 1996.

In February 1997, the Open Group released their last major version of CDE, version 2.1.

Red Hat Linux was the only Linux distribution that proprietary CDE was ported to. In 1997, Red Hat began offering a version of CDE licensed from TriTeal Corporation. In 1998, Xi Graphics, a company specializing in the X Windowing System, offered a version of CDE bundled with Red Hat Linux, called &quot;Xi Graphics maXimum cde/OS&quot;. These were phased out, and Red Hat moved to the GNOME desktop.

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as GNOME and K Desktop Environment 2 were quickly becoming mature, and became widespread on Linux systems.

In 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard desktop environment in Solaris in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based Java Desktop System. The OpenSolaris project, begun around the same time, did not include CDE, and had no intent to make Solaris CDE available as open-source. The original release of Solaris 11 in November 2011 only contained GNOME as standard desktop, though some CDE libraries, such as Motif and ToolTalk, remained for binary compatibility but Oracle Solaris 11.4, released in August 2018, removed support for the CDE runtime environment and background services.

=== Systems that provided proprietary CDE ===
* IBM AIX
* Digital UNIX
* HP-UX: from version 10.10, released in 1996.
* IRIX: for a short time CDE was an alternative to IRIX Interactive Desktop.
* OpenVMS: available in OpenVMS Alpha V7.1 and onwards, referred to as the &quot;DECWindows Motif New Desktop&quot;
* Solaris: available starting with 2.3, standard in 2.6 to 10.
* Tru64 UNIX
* UnixWare
* UXP/DS
* Red Hat Linux: Two versions ported by Triteal and Xi Graphics

== License history ==
From its launch until 2012, CDE was proprietary software.

Motif, the toolkit on which CDE is built, was released by The Open Group in 2000 as &quot;Open Motif,&quot; under a &quot;revenue sharing&quot; license. That license did not meet either the open source or free software definitions. The Open Group had wished to make Motif open source, but did not succeed doing so at that time.

=== Release under the GNU LGPL ===
In 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license. On August 6, 2012, CDE was released under the LGPL-2.0-or-later license. The CDE source code was then released to SourceForge.

The free software project OpenCDE had been started in 2010 to reproduce the look and feel, organization, and feature set of CDE. In August 2012, when CDE was released as free software, OpenCDE was officially deprecated in favor of CDE.

On October 23, 2012, the Motif widget toolkit was also released under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license. This allowed CDE to become a completely free and open source desktop environment.

Shortly after CDE was released as free software, a Linux live CD was created based on Debian 6 with CDE 2.2.0c pre-installed, called CDEbian. The live CD has since been discontinued.

The Debian-based Linux distribution SparkyLinux offers binary packages of CDE that can be installed with APT. As of March 2023, CDE is also included in the NuTyX GNU/Linux distribution which offers an ISO download image with it, in FreeBSD and in source form in pkgsrc which is the default package manager of NetBSD.

== Development under CDE project ==
In March 2014, the first stable release of CDE, version 2.2.1, was made since its release as free software.

Beginning with version 2.2.2, released in July 2014, CDE is able to compile under FreeBSD 10 with the default Clang compiler.

Since version 2.3.0, released in July 2018, CDE uses TIRPC on Linux, so that the portmapper rpcbind does not need to be run in insecure mode. It does not use Xprint anymore, and can be compiled on the BSDs without installing first a custom version of Motif. Multihead display support with Xinerama has been improved.

Since its release as free software, CDE has been ported to:

* Linux distributions including:
** Debian
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux
** Slackware Linux
** Ubuntu
** Arch Linux
* FreeBSD
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD
* OpenIndiana
* Solaris 11 (x86-64)

Future project goals of the CDE project include:

* Increased portability to more Linux, BSD, and Unix platforms.
* Further internationalization into other languages.

<doc id="6628" wikidata="Q437365" url="?curid=6628" title="Children of Dune">
<text>Children of Dune is a 1976 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the third in his &quot;Dune&quot; series of six novels. Originally serialized in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; in 1976, it was the last &quot;Dune&quot; novel to be serialized before book publication.

At the end of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Paul Atreides walks into the desert, a blind man, leaving his sister Alia to rule the universe as regent for his twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Awakened in the womb by the spice, the children are the heirs to Paul&#x27;s prescient vision of the fate of the universe, a role that Alia desperately craves. House Corrino schemes to return to the throne, while the Bene Gesserit make common cause with the Tleilaxu and Spacing Guild to gain control of the spice and Paul&#x27;s children.

Initially selling over 75,000 copies, it became the first hardcover best-seller in science fiction. The novel was critically well-received for its plot, action, and atmosphere and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1977. &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; were collectively adapted by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003 into a miniseries titled &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;.

==Plot==
Nine years after Emperor Paul &quot;Muad&#x27;Dib&quot; Atreides walked into the desert, the ecological transformation of Dune has reached the point where some Fremen are living without stillsuits in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad&#x27;Dib. The imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the jihad.

Paul&#x27;s young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their aunt and guardian Alia has succumbed to Abomination—possession by her grandfather Baron Vladimir Harkonnen—and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the terraforming of Dune will kill all the sandworms, thus destroying the source of the spice, but the Baron desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will become trapped by his prescience.

Meanwhile, a new religious figure called &quot;The Preacher&quot; has risen in the desert, rallying against the religious government&#x27;s injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. Princess Wensicia of the fallen House Corrino on Salusa Secundus plots to assassinate the twins and regain power for her House.

Lady Jessica returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter is possessed, but finds no signs of Abomination in the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader Stilgar to protect Ghanima if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia&#x27;s son Farad&#x27;n, and in return pledges the Duncan Idaho ghola as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan&#x27;s help, precipitating a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the Corrino assassination plot, faking Leto&#x27;s death. 

Leto leaves to seek out Jacurutu, a mythical Fremen sietch and possible holdout of the Preacher, while Ghanima, changing her memory with self-hypnosis, reports (and believes) that her brother has been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa Secundus, where Jessica begins to mentor Farad&#x27;n in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. He sidelines and publicly denounces his regent mother Wensicia over the assassination attempt, and allies with the Bene Gesserit, who promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid to become Emperor.

A band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the spice trance at the suggestion of Gurney Halleck, who has infiltrated the group on Jessica&#x27;s orders. Leto&#x27;s spice-induced visions show him a myriad of possible futures where humanity becomes extinct and only one where it survives. He names this future &quot;The Golden Path&quot; and resolves to bring it to fruition—something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. He escapes his captors and sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically fusing with a school of sandtrout, the larval form of sandworms, in the process gaining superhuman strength and near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert destroying qanats to slow down the ecological transformation of Dune, and eventually confronts the Preacher, who is indeed Paul.

Duncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him so that Stilgar is forced to take Ghanima and go into hiding. Eventually though, Alia recaptures Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad&#x27;n, planning to exploit the expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother&#x27;s murder. Paul and Leto return to the capital, where Jessica and Farad&#x27;n have arrived for his betrothal to Ghanima, to confront Alia. Upon arriving, Paul is publicly murdered by agents of Alia&#x27;s government, to her horror. Leto reveals himself in a display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima&#x27;s genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her possession, but the Baron resists. Alia, while fighting the Baron&#x27;s possession, manages to throw herself off a high balcony, killing both herself and the Baron.

Leto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen. Farad&#x27;n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino armies and his Sardaukar. In describing the Golden Path to Farad&#x27;n, Leto reveals that he will live for thousands of years due to the sandworm skin and genetics he is encased in. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but because his sandworm skin destroyed his ability to reproduce, he allows Farad&#x27;n to be her true consort so the Atreides line can continue. Ghanima reflects that one twin had to follow the Path, but Leto was always the stronger.

==Publication history==
Parts of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; were written before &quot;Dune&quot; was completed. &quot;Children of Dune&quot; was originally serialized in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; in 1976, and was the last &quot;Dune&quot; novel to be serialized before book publication. &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; were published in one volume by the Science Fiction Book Club in 2002.

==Analysis==
Herbert likened the initial trilogy of novels (&quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;) to a fugue – &quot;Dune&quot; was a heroic melody, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; was its inversion, while &quot;Children of Dune&quot; expands the number of interplaying themes. Paul rises to power in &quot;Dune&quot; by seizing control of the single critical resource in the universe, melange. His enemies are dead or overthrown, and he is set to take the reins of power and bring a hard but enlightened peace to the universe. Herbert chose in the books that followed to undermine Paul&#x27;s triumph with a string of failures and philosophical paradoxes.

==Critical reception==
Initially selling over 75,000 copies, &quot;Children of Dune&quot; became the first hardcover best-seller in the science fiction field. The novel was critically well-received for its gripping plot, action, and atmosphere, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1977.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Children of Dune&quot; &quot;a major event&quot;, and &quot;Challenging Destiny&quot; noted that &quot;Herbert adds enough new twists and turns to the ongoing saga that familiarity with the recurring elements brings pleasure.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Ranging from palace intrigue and desert chases to religious speculation and confrontations with the supreme intelligence of the universe, there is something here for all science fiction fans.&quot; In a 1976 review, Spider Robinson found &quot;Children of Dune&quot; unsatisfying, faulting the ending as unconvincing and thematically overfamiliar. The novel is referred to in &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot; (1980) by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. David Pringle gave the novel a rating of two stars out of four and described the novel as &quot;dark and convoluted stuff.&quot;

==Adaptation==
&quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; were collectively adapted by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2003 into a miniseries titled &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The three-part, six-hour miniseries covers the bulk of the plot of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; in the first installment, and adapts &quot;Children of Dune&quot; in the second and third parts.

<doc id="6629" wikidata="Q215894" url="?curid=6629" title="Candide">
<text>&#x27; ( , ) is a French satire written by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment, first published in 1759. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: Optimism&quot;&quot;&#x27; (1947). A young man, Candide, lives a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise, being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. This lifestyle is abruptly ended, followed by Candide&#x27;s slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes &quot;Candide&quot; with, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, &quot;we must cultivate our garden&quot;, in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, &quot;all is for the best&quot; in the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot;.

&quot;Candide&quot; is characterized by its tone as well as its erratic, fantastical, and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story akin to a serious bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, in a tone that is bitter and matter-of-fact. The events discussed are often based on historical happenings. As philosophers of Voltaire&#x27;s day contended with the problem of evil, so does Candide, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers. Through &quot;Candide&quot;, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.

&quot;Candide&quot; has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned because of its religious blasphemy, political sedition, and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naivety. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has inspired many later authors and artists. Today, &quot;Candide&quot; is considered Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and is often listed as part of the Western canon. It is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. Martin Seymour-Smith listed &quot;Candide&quot; as one of the 100 most influential books ever written.

== Historical and literary background ==
Several historical events inspired Voltaire to write &quot;Candide&quot;, most notably the publication of Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;Monadology&quot;, the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in &quot;Candide&quot;. The earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of All Saints&#x27; Day had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. It had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system founded on the theodicy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, which insisted on God&#x27;s benevolence in spite of such events. This concept is often put in the form, &quot;all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds&quot; (). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into their optimistic world view.
Voltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster, convinced that if this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is. In both &quot;Candide&quot; and (&quot;Poem on the Lisbon Disaster&quot;), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters &quot;in the best of all possible worlds&quot;. Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and &quot;Candide&quot;, has analyzed which sources Voltaire might have referenced. speculating that Voltaire&#x27;s primary source was the 1755 work by Ange Goudar.

Apart from such events, contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text, as they were for , a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen and inspired by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The protagonist of this novel, supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics, is quite similar to the protagonist of &quot;Candide&quot;. These stereotypes, according to Voltaire biographer Alfred Owen Aldridge, include &quot;extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity&quot;, two of Candide&#x27;s and Simplicius&#x27;s defining qualities. Aldridge writes, &quot;Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style, it is quite possible that he knew as well.&quot;

A satirical and parodic precursor of &quot;Candide&quot;, Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726) is one of &quot;Candide&quot;″s closest literary relatives. This satire tells the story of &quot;a gullible ingenue&quot;, Gulliver, who (like Candide) travels to several &quot;remote nations&quot; and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him. As evidenced by similarities between the two books, Voltaire probably drew upon &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; for inspiration while writing &quot;Candide&quot;. Other probable sources of inspiration for &quot;Candide&quot; are (1699) by François Fénelon and (1753) by Louis-Charles Fougeret de Monbron. &quot;Candide&quot;″s parody of the bildungsroman is probably based on , which includes the prototypical parody of the tutor on whom Pangloss may have been partly based. Likewise, Monbron&#x27;s protagonist undergoes a disillusioning series of travels similar to those of Candide.

== Creation ==


By the time of the Lisbon earthquake, Voltaire was already a well-established author. &quot;Candide&quot; became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political, and artistic works expressing these views. It became a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the &quot;contes philosophiques&quot;. This genre included previous works of his such as &quot;Zadig&quot; and &quot;Micromegas&quot;.
It is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote &quot;Candide.&quot; Scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while living at Les Délices near Geneva and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate, at Schwetzingen for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that he wrote &quot;Candide&quot; in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work by Lucien Pereyand Gaston Maugras.
There is only one extant manuscript of &quot;Candide&quot; that was written before the work&#x27;s 1759 publication, discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the &quot;La Vallière Manuscript&quot;. It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The &quot;La Vallière Manuscript&quot;, the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of &quot;Candide&quot;, was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have been another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.
Voltaire published &quot;Candide&quot; simultaneously in five countries no later than 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain. Seventeen versions of &quot;Candide&quot; from 1759, in the original French, are known today, and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest. More versions were published in other languages: &quot;Candide&quot; was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year. The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of &quot;Candide&quot; is described at length in Wade&#x27;s article &quot;The First Edition of &quot;Candide&quot;: A Problem of Identification&quot;. The publication process was extremely secretive, probably the &quot;most clandestine work of the century&quot;, because of the book&#x27;s obviously illicit and irreverent content. The greatest number of copies of &quot;Candide&quot; were published concurrently in Geneva by Cramer, in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey, in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert.

&quot;Candide&quot; underwent one major revision after its initial publication, in addition to some minor ones. In 1761, a version of &quot;Candide&quot; was published that included, along with several minor changes, a major addition by Voltaire to the twenty-second chapter, a section that had been thought weak by the Duke of Vallière. The English title of this edition was &quot;Candide, or Optimism, Translated from the German of Dr. Ralph. With the additions found in the Doctor&#x27;s pocket when he died at Minden, in the Year of Grace 1759.&quot; The last edition of &quot;Candide&quot; authorised by Voltaire was the one included in Cramer&#x27;s 1775 edition of his complete works, known as , in reference to the border or frame around each page.
Voltaire strongly opposed the inclusion of illustrations in his works, as he stated in a 1778 letter to the writer and publisher Charles Joseph Panckoucke:

Despite this protest, two sets of illustrations for &quot;Candide&quot; were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau&#x27;s own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl&#x27;s publication of that year, &quot;Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire&quot;. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading &quot;Candide&quot; that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Candide&quot; contains thirty episodic chapters, which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist&#x27;s hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, the first half of &quot;Candide&quot; constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire&#x27;s additions of 1761.

=== Chapters I–X ===
The tale of &quot;Candide&quot; begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh in Westphalia, home to the Baron&#x27;s daughter, Lady Cunégonde; his bastard nephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; a chambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron&#x27;s family. The protagonist, Candide, is romantically attracted to Cunégonde. He is a young man of &quot;the most unaffected simplicity&quot; (), whose face is &quot;the true index of his mind&quot; (). Dr. Pangloss, professor of &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology&quot;) and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; and that &quot;all is for the best&quot;.
All is well in the castle until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is flogged, nearly executed, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an Anabaptist, who strengthens Candide&#x27;s optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with syphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cunégonde was raped before her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail to Lisbon.

In Lisbon&#x27;s harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the &quot;brutish sailor&quot; who let Jacques drown survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit by an earthquake, tsunami, and fire that kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.

The next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of the Portuguese Inquisition, and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an &quot; set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman, who leads him to a house where Lady Cunégonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cunégonde had been raped and disemboweled. She had been, but Cunégonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corrupt Grand Inquisitor into sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cunégonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and the sabbath day). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas. Along the way, Cunégonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her.

=== Chapters XI–XX ===
The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter of Pope Urban X and the Princess of Palestrina, she was kidnapped and enslaved by Barbary pirates, witnessed violent civil wars in Morocco under the bloodthirsty king Moulay Ismaïl (during which her mother was drawn and quartered), suffered constant hunger, nearly died from a plague in Algiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starving Janissaries during the Russian capture of Azov. After traversing all the Russian Empire, she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cunégonde.

The trio arrives in Buenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d&#x27;Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, an &quot;alcalde&quot; (a Spanish magistrate) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees to Paraguay with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.

At a border post on the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde&#x27;s unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits&#x27; preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.

Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of the Inca nobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.

After a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a geographically isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king&#x27;s jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.

Candide and Cacambo eventually reach Suriname where they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide&#x27;s remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.

=== Chapters XXI–XXX ===
This companion, Martin, is a Manichaean scholar based on the real-life pessimist Pierre Bayle, who was a chief opponent of Leibniz. For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour to Bordeaux and Paris, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based on Admiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot; (to encourage the others). Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival in Venice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a Theatine monk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object since she was forced to become a prostitute, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousand piastres to Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.

Candide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo—now a slave—arrives and informs Candide that Cunégonde is in Constantinople. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for the Carnival of Venice. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III, Emperor Ivan VI of Russia, Charles Edward Stuart (an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne), Augustus III of Poland (deprived, at the time of writing, of his reign in the Electorate of Saxony due to the Seven Years&#x27; War), Stanisław Leszczyński, and Theodore of Corsica.

On the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cunégonde—now horribly ugly—currently washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis as a slave for a fugitive Transylvanian prince by the name of Rákóczi. After arriving at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide&#x27;s surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde&#x27;s brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. They both relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss&#x27;s optimism remains unshaken: &quot;I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I&#x27;m a philosopher, and it wouldn&#x27;t be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter.&quot;

Candide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cunégonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Giroflée—having squandered their three thousand piastres—are reconciled with Candide on a small farm () which he just bought with the last of his finances.

One day, the protagonists seek out a dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Candide asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Candide is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them &quot;free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.&quot; Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this &quot;commendable plan&quot; () on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss&#x27;s insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him &quot;we must cultivate our garden&quot; ().

== Style ==
As Voltaire himself described it, the purpose of &quot;Candide&quot; was to &quot;bring amusement to a small number of men of wit&quot;. The author achieves this goal by combining wit with a parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire&#x27;s matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death &quot;as coolly as a weather report&quot;. The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again. In the end, &quot;Candide&quot; is primarily, as described by Voltaire&#x27;s biographer Ian Davidson, &quot;short, light, rapid and humorous&quot;.

Behind the playful façade of &quot;Candide&quot; which has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for the execution of John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in &quot;Candide&quot;. For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, &quot;[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all …&quot;. Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.

===Satire===
The main method of &quot;Candide&quot;″s satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus &quot;Candide&quot; derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.

A simple example of the satire of &quot;Candide&quot; is seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin in Portsmouth harbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to represent John Byng, being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely &quot;to encourage the others&quot; (, an expression Voltaire is credited with originating). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng&#x27;s death. The dry, pithy explanation &quot;to encourage the others&quot; thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted from &quot;Candide&quot;.

Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero&#x27;s desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of &quot;Candide&quot; is a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of El Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.
Another element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works on &quot;Candide&quot;, calls the &quot;sentimental foibles of the age&quot; and Voltaire&#x27;s attack on them. Flaws in European culture are highlighted as &quot;Candide&quot; parodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking the style of a picaresque novel. A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire&#x27;s work: Candide is supposed to be the drifting rogue of low social class, Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor, and Cacambo the skillful valet. As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters of &quot;Candide&quot; are unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and even marionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical. As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, if not a very serious one.

=== Garden motif ===
Gardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role in &quot;Candide&quot;. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion as Adam and Eve are evicted from the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis. Cyclically, the main characters of &quot;Candide&quot; conclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent &quot;garden&quot; is El Dorado, which may be a false Eden. Other possibly symbolic gardens include the Jesuit pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo&#x27;s garden, and the Turk&#x27;s garden.

These gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, and that Candide&#x27;s conclusion to cultivate &quot;his garden&quot; symbolises Voltaire&#x27;s great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire&#x27;s tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the : the main characters of &quot;Candide&quot; live in seclusion to &quot;cultivate [their] garden&quot;, just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the . Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating &quot;his garden&quot; suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire&#x27;s own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates in Les Délices and Ferney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.

== Philosophy ==
===Optimism===
&quot;Candide&quot; satirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these is Leibnizian optimism (sometimes called &quot;Panglossianism&quot; after its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity. Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire&#x27;s treatment of evil—specifically the theological problem of
its existence—is the focus of the work. Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder—evils of human design—are explored as extensively in &quot;Candide&quot; as are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is &quot;comprehensive&quot; in his enumeration of the world&#x27;s evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.

Fundamental to Voltaire&#x27;s attack is Candide&#x27;s tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss&#x27;s theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss&#x27;s reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss&#x27;s first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:

Following such flawed reasoning even more doggedly than Candide, Pangloss defends optimism. Whatever their horrendous fortune, Pangloss reiterates &quot;all is for the best&quot; (&quot;&quot;) and proceeds to &quot;justify&quot; the evil event&#x27;s occurrence. A characteristic example of such theodicy is found in Pangloss&#x27;s explanation of why it is good that syphilis exists:

Candide, the impressionable and incompetent student of Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and eventually despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his optimism.

This critique of Voltaire&#x27;s seems to be directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. &quot;Candide&quot; does not ridicule Voltaire&#x27;s contemporary Alexander Pope, a later optimist of slightly different convictions. &quot;Candide&quot; does not discuss Pope&#x27;s optimistic principle that &quot;all is right&quot;, but Leibniz&#x27;s that states, &quot;this is the best of all possible worlds&quot;. However subtle the difference between the two, &quot;Candide&quot; is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Poème&quot; may have been written as a more direct response to Pope&#x27;s theories. This work is similar to &quot;Candide&quot; in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the &quot;Poème&quot; embodies a more serious philosophical argument than &quot;Candide&quot;.

=== Conclusion ===
The conclusion of the novel, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor&#x27;s optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of &quot;Candide&quot; has been written about voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.

Voltaire develops no formal, systematic philosophy for the characters to adopt. The conclusion of the novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire&#x27;s ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire&#x27;s negative descriptions of Martin&#x27;s principles and the conclusion of the work in which Martin plays little part.

Within debates attempting to decipher the conclusion of &quot;Candide&quot; lies another primary &quot;Candide&quot; debate. This one concerns the degree to which Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group&#x27;s reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions&#x27; loss of hope for the rest of the human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.

=== Inside vs. outside interpretations ===
Separate from the debate about the text&#x27;s conclusion is the &quot;inside/outside&quot; controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that &quot;Candide&quot; does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire&#x27;s history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) it. This point of view, the &quot;inside&quot;, specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;voice&quot; in the many characters of &quot;Candide&quot; and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as speaking through at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that &quot;Candide&quot; should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire&#x27;s personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently. 

Critics such as Lester Crocker, Henry Stavan, and Vivienne Mylne find too many similarities between &quot;Candide&quot;″s point of view and that of Voltaire to accept the &quot;inside&quot; view; they support the &quot;outside&quot; interpretation. They believe that Candide&#x27;s final decision is the same as Voltaire&#x27;s, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author. Some scholars who support the &quot;outside&quot; view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire. Others see a strong parallel between Candide&#x27;s gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author. Martine Darmon Meyer argues that the &quot;inside&quot; view fails to see the satirical work in context, and that denying that &quot;Candide&quot; is primarily a mockery of optimism (a matter of historical context) is a &quot;very basic betrayal of the text&quot;.

== Reception ==

Though Voltaire did not openly admit to having written the controversial &quot;Candide&quot; until 1768 (until then he signed with a pseudonym: &quot;Monsieur le docteur Ralph&quot;, or &quot;Doctor Ralph&quot;), his authorship of the work was hardly disputed.

Immediately after publication, the work and its author were denounced by both secular and religious authorities, because the book openly derides government and church alike. It was because of such polemics that Omer-Louis-François Joly de Fleury, who was Advocate General to the Parisian parliament when &quot;Candide&quot; was published, found parts of &quot;Candide&quot; to be &quot;contrary to religion and morals&quot;.

Despite much official indictment, soon after its publication, &quot;Candide&quot;″s irreverent prose was being quoted. &quot;Let us eat a Jesuit&quot;, for instance, became a popular phrase for its reference to a humorous passage in &quot;Candide&quot;. By the end of February 1759, the Grand Council of Geneva and the administrators of Paris had banned &quot;Candide&quot;. &quot;Candide&quot; nevertheless succeeded in selling twenty thousand to thirty thousand copies by the end of the year in more than twenty editions, making it a best seller. The Duke de La Vallière speculated near the end of January 1759 that &quot;Candide&quot; might have been the fastest-selling book ever. In 1762, &quot;Candide&quot; was listed in the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;, the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s list of prohibited books.

Bannings of &quot;Candide&quot; lasted into the twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been considered a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, &quot;Candide&quot; was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed &quot;obscene&quot;, from reaching a Harvard University French class. &quot;Candide&quot; was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after &quot;Candide&quot;″s detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office&#x27;s decision to ban it, &quot;But about &#x27;Candide,&#x27; I&#x27;ll tell you. For years we&#x27;ve been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it. It&#x27;s a filthy book&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Candide&quot; is the most widely read of Voltaire&#x27;s many works, and it is considered one of the great achievements of Western literature. William F. Bottiglia opines, &quot;The physical size of &quot;Candide&quot;, as well as Voltaire&#x27;s attitude toward his fiction, precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude, autonomous &#x27;3D&#x27; vitality, emotional resonance, or poetic exaltation. &quot;Candide&quot;, then, cannot in quantity or quality, measure up to the supreme classics&quot; such as the works of Homer or Shakespeare, Sophocles, Chaucer, Dante, Cervantes, Fielding, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Racine, or Molière. Bottiglia instead calls it a miniature classic; but others have been more forgiving of its size. As the only work of Voltaire which has remained popular up to the present day, &quot;Candide&quot; is listed in Harold Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages&quot;. It is included in the Encyclopædia Britannica collection &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;. &quot;Candide&quot; has influenced modern writers of black humour such as Céline, Joseph Heller, John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, and Terry Southern. Its parody and picaresque methods have become favourites of black humorists.

Charles Brockden Brown, an early American novelist, may have been directly affected by Voltaire, whose work he knew well. Mark Kamrath, professor of English, describes the strength of the connection between &quot;Candide&quot; and Brown&#x27;s &quot;Edgar Huntly; or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker&quot; (1799): &quot;An unusually large number of parallels...crop up in the two novels, particularly in terms of characters and plot.&quot; For instance, the protagonists of both novels are romantically involved with a recently orphaned young woman. Furthermore, in both works the brothers of the female lovers are Jesuits, and each is murdered (although under different circumstances). 

Some twentieth-century novels that may have been influenced by &quot;Candide&quot; are some dystopian science-fiction works. Armand Mattelart, a French critic, sees &quot;Candide&quot; in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, and Yevgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;, three canonical works of the genre. Specifically, Mattelart writes that in each of these works, there exist references to &quot;Candide&quot;″s popularisation of the phrase &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot;. He cites as evidence, for example, that the French version of &quot;Brave New World&quot; was entitled ().

Readers of &quot;Candide&quot; often compare it with certain works of the modern genre the Theatre of the Absurd. Haydn Mason, a Voltaire scholar, sees in &quot;Candide&quot; a few similarities to this brand of literature. For instance, he notes commonalities of &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1952). In both of these works, and in a similar manner, friendship provides emotional support for characters when they are confronted with harshness of their existences. However, Mason qualifies, &quot;the must not be seen as a forerunner of the &#x27;absurd&#x27; in modern fiction. Candide&#x27;s world has many ridiculous and meaningless elements, but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability to make sense out of it.&quot; John Pilling, biographer of Beckett, does state that &quot;Candide&quot; was an early and powerful influence on Beckett&#x27;s thinking. Rosa Luxemburg, in the aftermath of the First World War, remarked upon re-reading &quot;Candide&quot;: &quot;Before the war, I would have thought this wicked compilation of all human misery a caricature. Now it strikes me as altogether realistic.&quot;

The American alternative rock band Bloodhound Gang refer to &quot;Candide&quot; in their song &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, from the American edition of their 1999 album &quot;Hooray for Boobies&quot;.

=== Derivative works ===
In 1760, one year after Voltaire published &quot;Candide&quot;, a sequel was published with the name . This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. &quot;Part II&quot; has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of &quot;Candide&quot;, but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of &quot;Candide&quot; or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.

&quot;Candide&quot; was adapted for the radio anthology program &quot;On Stage&quot; in 1953. Richard Chandlee wrote the script; Elliott Lewis, Cathy Lewis, Edgar Barrier, Byron Kane, Jack Kruschen, Howard McNear, Larry Thor, Martha Wentworth, and Ben Wright performed.

The operetta &quot;Candide&quot; was originally conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman, as a play with incidental music. Leonard Bernstein, the American composer and conductor who wrote the music, was so excited about the project that he convinced Hellman to do it as a &quot;comic operetta&quot;. Many lyricists worked on the show, including James Agee, Dorothy Parker, John Latouche, Richard Wilbur, Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, and Hellman. Hershy Kay orchestrated all the pieces except for the overture, which Bernstein did himself. &quot;Candide&quot; first opened on Broadway as a musical on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and conducted by Samuel Krachmalnick. While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman&#x27;s libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire&#x27;s novel. &quot;Candide&quot; has been revised and reworked several times. The first New York revival, directed by Hal Prince, featured an entirely new libretto by Hugh Wheeler and additional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Bernstein revised the work again in 1987 with the collaboration of John Mauceri and John Wells. After Bernstein&#x27;s death, further revised productions of the musical were performed in versions prepared by Trevor Nunn and John Caird in 1999, and Mary Zimmerman in 2010.

The BBC produced a television adaptation in 1973, with Ian Ogilvy as Candide, Emrys James as Dr. Pangloss, and Frank Finlay as Voltaire himself, acting as the narrator.

&quot;&quot; (1977) or simply is a book by Leonardo Sciascia. It was at least partly based on Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;, although the actual influence of &quot;Candide&quot; on is a hotly debated topic. A number of theories on the matter have been proposed. Proponents of one say that is very similar to &quot;Candide&quot;, only with a happy ending; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work, that the two books are quite distinct.

Nedim Gürsel wrote his 2001 novel &quot;Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul&quot; about a minor passage in &quot;Candide&quot; during which its protagonist meets Ahmed III, the deposed Turkish sultan. This chance meeting on a ship from Venice to Istanbul is the setting of Gürsel&#x27;s book. Terry Southern, in writing his popular novel &quot;Candy&quot; with Mason Hoffenberg adapted &quot;Candide&quot; for a modern audience and changed the protagonist from male to female. &quot;Candy&quot; deals with the rejection of a sort of optimism which the author sees in women&#x27;s magazines of the modern era; &quot;Candy&quot; also parodies pornography and popular psychology. This adaptation of &quot;Candide&quot; was adapted for the cinema by director Christian Marquand in 1968.

In addition to the above, &quot;Candide&quot; was made into a number of minor films and theatrical adaptations throughout the twentieth century. For a list of these, see (1989) with preface and commentaries by Pierre Malandain.
In May 2009, a play titled &quot;Optimism&quot;, based on &quot;Candide&quot;, opened at the CUB Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne. It followed the basic story of &quot;Candide&quot;, incorporating anachronisms, music, and stand up comedy from comedian Frank Woodley. It toured Australia and played at the Edinburgh International Festival. In 2010, the Icelandic writer Óttar M. Norðfjörð published a rewriting and modernisation of &quot;Candide&quot;, titled .

<text>In computer architecture, a bus (historically also called a data highway or databus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. It encompasses both hardware (e.g., wires, optical fiber) and software, including communication protocols. At its core, a bus is a shared physical pathway, typically composed of wires, traces on a circuit board, or busbars, that allows multiple devices to communicate. To prevent conflicts and ensure orderly data exchange, buses rely on a communication protocol to manage which device can transmit data at a given time.

Buses are categorized based on their role, such as system buses (also known as internal buses, internal data buses, or memory buses) connecting the CPU and memory. Expansion buses, also called peripheral buses, extend the system to connect additional devices, including peripherals. Examples of widely used buses include PCI Express (PCIe) for high-speed internal connections and Universal Serial Bus (USB) for connecting external devices.

Modern buses utilize both parallel and serial communication, employing advanced encoding methods to maximize speed and efficiency. Features such as direct memory access (DMA) further enhance performance by allowing data transfers directly between devices and memory without requiring CPU intervention.

==Address bus==

An &quot;address bus&quot; is a bus that is used to specify a physical address. When a processor or DMA-enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location, it specifies that memory location on the address bus (the value to be read or written is sent on the data bus). The width of the address bus determines the amount of memory a system can address. For example, a system with a &quot;32-bit&quot; address bus can address &quot;232&quot; (4,294,967,296) memory locations. If each memory location holds one byte, the addressable memory space is about .

=== Address multiplexing ===
Early processors used a wire for each bit of the address width. For example, a 16-bit address bus had 16 physical wires making up the bus. As the buses became wider and lengthier, this approach became expensive in terms of the number of chip pins and board traces. Beginning with the Mostek 4096 DRAM, address multiplexing implemented with multiplexers became common. In a multiplexed address scheme, the address is sent in two equal parts on alternate bus cycles. This halves the number of address bus signals required to connect to the memory. For example, a 32-bit address bus can be implemented by using 16 lines and sending the first half of the memory address, immediately followed by the second half memory address.

Typically two additional pins in the control busrow-address strobe (RAS) and column-address strobe (CAS)are used to tell the DRAM whether the address bus is currently sending the first half of the memory address or the second half.

===Implementation===
Accessing an individual byte frequently requires reading or writing the full bus width (a word) at once. In these instances the least significant bits of the address bus may not even be implemented - it is instead the responsibility of the controlling device to isolate the individual byte required from the complete word transmitted. This is the case, for instance, with the VESA Local Bus which lacks the two least significant bits, limiting this bus to aligned 32-bit transfers.

Historically, there were also some examples of computers that were only able to address wordsword machines.

==Memory bus==

The &quot;memory bus&quot; is the bus that connects the main memory to the memory controller in computer systems. Originally, general-purpose buses like VMEbus and the S-100 bus were used, but to reduce latency, modern memory buses are designed to connect directly to DRAM chips, and thus are defined by chip standards bodies such as JEDEC. Examples are the various generations of SDRAM, and serial point-to-point buses like SLDRAM and RDRAM.

==Implementation details==
Buses can be parallel buses, which carry data words in parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra power and control connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in 1-Wire and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses become more and more difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to double pump the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. Multidrop connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.

The transition from parallel to serial buses was allowed by Moore&#x27;s law which allowed for the incorporation of SerDes in integrated circuits which are used in computers.

Network connections such as Ethernet are not generally regarded as buses, although the difference is largely conceptual rather than practical. An attribute generally used to characterize a bus is that power is provided by the bus for the connected hardware. This emphasizes the busbar origins of bus architecture as supplying switched or distributed power. This excludes, as buses, schemes such as serial RS-232, parallel Centronics, IEEE 1284 interfaces and Ethernet, since these devices also needed separate power supplies. Universal Serial Bus devices may use the bus supplied power, but often use a separate power source. This distinction is exemplified by a telephone system with a connected modem, where the RJ11 connection and associated modulated signalling scheme is not considered a bus, and is analogous to an Ethernet connection. A phone line connection scheme is not considered to be a bus with respect to signals, but the Central Office uses buses with cross-bar switches for connections between phones.

However, this distinctionthat power is provided by the busis not the case in many avionic systems, where data connections such as ARINC 429, ARINC 629, MIL-STD-1553B (STANAG 3838), and EFABus (STANAG 3910) are commonly referred to as &quot;data buses&quot; or, sometimes, &quot;databuses&quot;. Such avionic data buses are usually characterized by having several equipments or Line Replaceable Items/Units (LRI/LRUs) connected to a common, shared media. They may, as with ARINC 429, be simplex, i.e. have a single source LRI/LRU or, as with ARINC 629, MIL-STD-1553B, and STANAG 3910, be duplex, allow all the connected LRI/LRUs to act, at different times (half duplex), as transmitters and receivers of data.

The frequency or the speed of a bus is measured in Hz such as MHz and determines how many clock cycles there are per second; there can be one or more data transfers per clock cycle. If there is a single transfer per clock cycle it is known as Single Data Rate (SDR), and if there are two transfers per clock cycle it is known as Double Data Rate (DDR) although the use of signalling other than SDR is uncommon outside of RAM. An example of this is PCIe which uses SDR. Within each data transfer there can be multiple bits of data. This is described as the width of a bus which is the number of bits the bus can transfer per clock cycle and can be synonymous with the number of physical electrical conductors the bus has if each conductor transfers one bit at a time. The data rate in bits per second can be obtained by multiplying the number of bits per clock cycle times the frequency times the number of transfers per clock cycle. Alternatively a bus such as PCIe can use modulation or encoding such as PAM4 which groups 2 bits into symbols which are then transferred instead of the bits themselves, and allows for an increase in data transfer speed without increasing the frequency of the bus. The effective or real data transfer speed/rate may be lower due to the use of encoding that also allows for error correction such as 128/130b (b for bit) encoding. The data transfer speed is also known as the bandwidth.

=== Bus multiplexing ===
The simplest system bus has completely separate input data lines, output data lines, and address lines.
To reduce cost, most microcomputers have a bidirectional data bus, re-using the same wires for input and output at different times.

Some processors use a dedicated wire for each bit of the address bus, data bus, and the control bus.
For example, the 64-pin STEbus is composed of 8 physical wires dedicated to the 8-bit data bus, 20 physical wires dedicated to the 20-bit address bus, 21 physical wires dedicated to the control bus, and 15 physical wires dedicated to various power buses.

Bus multiplexing requires fewer wires, which reduces costs in many early microprocessors and DRAM chips.
One common multiplexing scheme, address multiplexing, has already been mentioned.
Another multiplexing scheme re-uses the address bus pins as the data bus pins, an approach used by conventional PCI and the 8086.
The various &quot;serial buses&quot; can be seen as the ultimate limit of multiplexing, sending each of the address bits and each of the data bits, one at a time, through a single pin (or a single differential pair).

==History==
Over time, several groups of people worked on various computer bus standards, including the IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee (BASC), the IEEE Superbus study group, the open microprocessor initiative (OMI), the open microsystems initiative (OMI), the Gang of Nine that developed EISA, etc.

===First generation===
Early computer buses were bundles of wire that attached computer memory and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the &quot;digit trunk&quot; in the early Australian CSIRAC computer, they were named after electrical power buses, or busbars. Almost always, there was one bus for memory, and one or more separate buses for peripherals. These were accessed by separate instructions, with completely different timings and protocols.

One of the first complications was the use of interrupts. Early computer programs performed I/O by waiting in a loop for the peripheral to become ready. This was a waste of time for programs that had other tasks to do. Also, if the program attempted to perform those other tasks, it might take too long for the program to check again, resulting in loss of data. Engineers thus arranged for the peripherals to interrupt the CPU. The interrupts had to be prioritized, because the CPU can only execute code for one peripheral at a time, and some devices are more time-critical than others.

High-end systems introduced the idea of channel controllers, which were essentially small computers dedicated to handling the input and output of a given bus. IBM introduced these on the IBM 709 in 1958, and they became a common feature of their platforms. Other high-performance vendors like Control Data Corporation implemented similar designs. Generally, the channel controllers would do their best to run all of the bus operations internally, moving data when the CPU was known to be busy elsewhere if possible, and only using interrupts when necessary. This greatly reduced CPU load, and provided better overall system performance.
To provide modularity, memory and I/O buses can be combined into a unified system bus. In this case, a single mechanical and electrical system can be used to connect together many of the system components, or in some cases, all of them.

Later computer programs began to share memory common to several CPUs. Access to this memory bus had to be prioritized, as well. The simple way to prioritize interrupts or bus access was with a daisy chain. In this case signals will naturally flow through the bus in physical or logical order, eliminating the need for complex scheduling.

===Minis and micros===
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced minicomputers, and mapped peripherals into the memory bus, so that the input and output devices appeared to be memory locations. This was implemented in the Unibus of the PDP-11 around 1969.

Early microcomputer bus systems were essentially a passive backplane connected directly or through buffer amplifiers to the pins of the CPU. Memory and other devices would be added to the bus using the same address and data pins as the CPU itself used, connected in parallel. Communication was controlled by the CPU, which read and wrote data from the devices as if they are blocks of memory, using the same instructions, all timed by a central clock controlling the speed of the CPU. Still, devices interrupted the CPU by signaling on separate CPU pins.

For instance, a disk drive controller would signal the CPU that new data was ready to be read, at which point the CPU would move the data by reading the memory location that corresponded to the disk drive. Almost all early microcomputers were built in this fashion, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system.

In some instances, most notably in the IBM PC, although similar physical architecture can be employed, instructions to access peripherals (codice_1 and codice_2) and memory (codice_3 and others) have not been made uniform at all, and still generate distinct CPU signals, that could be used to implement a separate I/O bus.

These simple bus systems had a serious drawback when used for general-purpose computers. All the equipment on the bus had to talk at the same speed, as it shared a single clock.

Increasing the speed of the CPU becomes harder, because the speed of all the devices must increase as well. When it is not practical or economical to have all devices as fast as the CPU, the CPU must either enter a wait state, or work at a slower clock frequency temporarily, to talk to other devices in the computer. While acceptable in embedded systems, this problem was not tolerated for long in general-purpose, user-expandable computers.

Such bus systems are also difficult to configure when constructed from common off-the-shelf equipment. Typically each added expansion card requires many jumpers in order to set memory addresses, I/O addresses, interrupt priorities, and interrupt numbers.

===Second generation===

Second-generation bus systems like NuBus addressed some of these problems. They typically separated the computer into two address spaces, the CPU and memory on one side, and the various peripheral devices on the other. A &quot;bus controller&quot; accepted data from the CPU side to be moved to the peripherals side, thus shifting the communications protocol burden from the CPU itself. This allowed the CPU and memory side to evolve separately from the peripheral bus. Devices on the bus could talk to each other with no CPU intervention. This led to much better performance but also required the cards to be much more complex. These buses also often addressed speed issues by being bigger in terms of the size of the data path, moving from 8-bit parallel buses in the first generation, to 16 or 32-bit in the second, as well as adding software setup (later standardized as Plug-n-play) to supplant or replace the jumpers.

However, these newer systems shared one quality with their earlier cousins, in that everyone on the bus had to talk at the same speed. While the CPU was now isolated and could increase speed, CPUs and memory continued to increase in speed much faster than the buses they talked to. The result was that the bus speeds were now much slower than what a modern system needed, and the machines were left starved for data. A particularly common example of this problem was that video cards quickly outran even the newer bus systems like PCI, and computers began to include AGP just to drive the video card. By 2004 AGP was outgrown again by high-end video cards and other peripherals and has been replaced by the new PCI Express bus.

An increasing number of external devices started employing their own bus systems as well. When disk drives were first introduced, they would be added to the machine with a card plugged into the bus, which is why computers have so many slots on the bus. But through the 1980s and 1990s, new systems like SCSI and IDE were introduced to serve this need, leaving most slots in modern systems empty. Today there are likely to be about five different buses in the typical machine, supporting various devices.

===Third generation===
Third-generation buses have been emerging into the market since about 2001, including HyperTransport and InfiniBand. They also tend to be very flexible in terms of their physical connections, allowing them to be used both as internal buses, as well as connecting different machines together. This can lead to complex problems when trying to service different requests, so much of the work on these systems concerns software design, as opposed to the hardware itself. In general, these third-generation buses tend to look more like a network than the original concept of a bus, with a higher protocol overhead needed than early systems, while also allowing multiple devices to use the bus at once.

Buses such as Wishbone have been developed by the open source hardware movement in an attempt to further remove legal and patent constraints from computer design.

The Compute Express Link (CXL) is an open standard interconnect for high-speed CPU-to-device and CPU-to-memory, designed to accelerate next-generation data center performance.

<doc id="6635" wikidata="Q1045090" url="?curid=6635" title="Chinese checkers">
<text>Chinese checkers (US) or Chinese chequers (UK), known as Sternhalma in German, is a strategy board game of German origin that can be played by two, three, four, or six people, playing individually or with partners. The game is a modern and simplified variation of the game Halma.

The objective is to be first to race all of one&#x27;s pieces across the hexagram-shaped board into &quot;home&quot;—the corner of the star opposite one&#x27;s starting corner—using single-step moves or moves that over other pieces. The remaining players continue the game to establish second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, and last-place finishers. 
==History and nomenclature==

The game was invented in Germany in 1892 under the name &quot;Stern-Halma&quot; as a variation of the older American game Halma. Like all Halma games, there is a similarity to checkers. The (German for &quot;star&quot;) refers to the board&#x27;s star shape (in contrast to the square board used in Halma). 

The name &quot;Chinese checkers&quot; originated in the United States as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The Pressman company&#x27;s game was originally called &quot;Hop Ching checkers&quot;. 

The game is known as () in Chinese. In Japan, the game has a variation called with slightly different rules.

==Rules==

The aim is to race all one&#x27;s pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board before the opponents do the same. The destination corner is called &quot;home&quot;. Each player has 10 pieces, except in games between two players, when 15 pieces are used. (On bigger star boards, 15 or 21 pieces are used.)

In &quot;hop across&quot;, the most popular variation, each player starts with their colored pieces on one of the six points or corners of the star and attempts to race them all home into the opposite corner. Players take turns moving a single piece, either by moving one step in any direction to an adjacent empty space, or by jumping in one or any number of available consecutive hops over other single pieces. A player may not combine hopping with a single-step move — a move consists of one or the other. There is no capturing in Chinese checkers, so pieces that are hopped over remain active and in play. Turns proceed clockwise around the board.

In the diagram, Blue might move the topmost piece one space diagonally forward as shown. A &quot;hop&quot; consists of jumping over a single adjacent piece, either one&#x27;s own or an opponent&#x27;s, to the empty space directly beyond it in the same line of direction. Red might advance the indicated piece by a chain of seven hops in a single move. It is not mandatory to make the most hops possible. (In some instances a player may choose to stop the jumping sequence part way in order to impede the opponent&#x27;s progress, or to align pieces for planned future moves.)

===Starting layouts===

====Six players====
Can be played &quot;all versus all&quot;, or three teams of two. When playing teams, teammates usually sit at opposite corners of the star, with each team member controlling their own colored set of pieces. The first team to advance both sets to their home destination corners is the winner. The remaining players usually continue play to determine second- and third-place finishers, etc.

====Four players====
The four-player game is the same as the game for six players, except that two opposite corners will be unused.

====Three players====

In a three-player game, all players control either one or two sets of pieces each. If one set is used, pieces race across the board into empty, opposite corners. If two sets are used, each player controls two differently colored sets of pieces at opposite corners of the star.

====Two players====
In a two-player game, each player plays one, two, or three sets of pieces. If one set is played, the pieces usually go into the opponent&#x27;s starting corner, and the number of pieces per side is increased to 15 (instead of the usual 10). If two sets are played, the pieces can either go into the opponent&#x27;s starting corners, or one of the players&#x27; two sets can go into an opposite empty corner. If three sets are played, the pieces usually go into the opponent&#x27;s starting corners.

==Strategy==
A basic strategy is to create or find the longest hopping path that leads closest to home, or immediately into it. (Multiple-jump moves are obviously faster to advance pieces than step-by-step moves.) Since either player can make use of any hopping &#x27;ladder&#x27; or &#x27;chain&#x27; created, a more advanced strategy involves hindering an opposing player, in addition to helping oneself make jumps across the board. Of equal importance are the players&#x27; strategies for emptying and filling their starting and home corners. Games between top players are rarely decided by more than a couple of moves.
Differing numbers of players result in different starting layouts, in turn imposing different best-game strategies. For example, if a player&#x27;s home destination corner starts empty (i.e. is not an opponent&#x27;s starting corner), the player can freely build a &#x27;ladder&#x27; or &#x27;bridge&#x27; with their pieces between the two opposite ends. But if a player&#x27;s opponent occupies the home corner, the player may need to wait for opponent pieces to clear before filling the home vacancies.

== Variants ==

=== Fast-paced or Super Chinese Checkers ===
While the standard rules allow hopping over only a single adjacent occupied position at a time (as in checkers), this version of the game allows pieces to catapult over multiple adjacent occupied positions in a line when hopping.

In the &quot;fast-paced&quot; or &quot;Super Chinese Checkers&quot; variant, popular in France, a piece may hop over a &quot;non-adjacent&quot; piece. A hop consists of jumping over a distant piece (friend or enemy) to a symmetrical position on the opposite side, in the same line of direction. (For example, if there are two empty positions between the jumping piece and the piece being jumped, the jumping piece lands, leaving exactly two empty positions immediately beyond the jumped piece.) As in the standard rules, a jumping move may consist of any number of a chain of hops. (When making a chain of hops, a piece is usually allowed to enter an empty corner, as long as it hops out again before the move is completed.)

Jumping over two or more pieces in a hop is not allowed. Therefore, in this variant, even more than in the standard version, it is sometimes strategically important to keep one&#x27;s pieces bunched in order to prevent a long opposing hop.

An alternative variant allows hops over &quot;any&quot; symmetrical arrangement, including pairs of pieces, pieces separated by empty positions, and so on.

=== Capture ===
In the &quot;capture&quot; variant, all sixty game pieces start out in the hexagonal field in the center of the gameboard. The center position is left unoccupied, so pieces form a symmetric hexagonal pattern. Color is irrelevant in this variant, so players take turns hopping any game piece over any other eligible game piece(s) on the board. The hopped-over pieces are captured (retired from the game, as in English draughts) and collected in the capturing player&#x27;s bin. Only jumping moves are allowed; the game ends when no further jumps are possible. The player with the most captured pieces is the winner.

The board is tightly packed at the start of the game. As more pieces are captured, the board frees up, often allowing multiple captures to take place in a single move.

Two or more players can compete in this variant, but if there are more than six players, not everyone will get a fair turn.

This variant resembles the game Leap Frog. The main difference being that in Leap Frog, the board is a square board.

=== Diamond game ===
Diamond game () is a variant of Chinese checkers played in South Korea and Japan. It uses the same jump rule as in Chinese checkers. The aim of the game is to enter all one&#x27;s pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board, before opponents do the same. Each player has ten or fifteen pieces. Ten-piece diamond uses a smaller gameboard than Chinese checkers, with 73 spaces. Fifteen-piece diamond uses the same board as in Chinese checkers, with 121 spaces. To play diamond, each player selects one color and places their 10 or 15 pieces on a triangle. Two or three players can compete.

Usually, there are one &quot;king piece&quot; () and 14 common pieces () on each side. The king piece is the piece at the apex of each area and can jump over the common pieces, but the common pieces cannot jump over the king piece.

=== Yin and Yang ===
In Yin and Yang, only two players compete and as in chess, Go, and Othello, only the black and the white marbles are used. For more interesting play, at the start of the game, the triangle placement of the opponents&#x27; marbles does not have to be 180 degrees in opposition.

=== Order Out Of Chaos ===
Two or more players select their coloured marbles and then those marbles are randomly placed in the centre of the board. The object of the game is then for the players to move their marbles out of the chaos to their home corners, creating order; the reverse of half a traditional game.

<text>Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. is an American financial services firm that was founded in 1945. It specializes in institutional equity, fixed-income sales and trading, and serving the middle market with investment banking services, prime brokerage, and commercial real estate financing. It is also active in new businesses, including advisory and asset management services, gaming technology, and e-commerce. It has more than 5,000 institutional clients.

Cantor Fitzgerald is one of 24 primary dealers that are authorized to trade US government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Cantor Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1,600 employees work in more than 30 locations, including financial centers in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Together with its affiliates, Cantor Fitzgerald operates in more than 60 offices in 20 countries and has more than 12,500 employees.

Before 2001, the company&#x27;s headquarters were located between the 101st and 105th floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, just above the impact site of American Airlines Flight 11 during the September 11 attacks. 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who were present that day were killed, representing the largest loss of life among any single organization in the attacks.

==Early history==
Cantor Fitzgerald was formed in 1945 by Bernard Gerald Cantor and John Fitzgerald as an investment bank and brokerage business. It later became known for its computer-based bond brokerage, the quality of its institutional distribution business model, and the market&#x27;s premier government securities dealer.

In 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began &quot;large block&quot; sales/trading of equities for institutional customers. It became the world&#x27;s first electronic marketplace for US government securities in 1972, and in 1983, it was the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in US government securities.

In 1991, Howard Lutnick was named president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald; he became chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., in 1996.

==September 11 attacks==


Cantor Fitzgerald&#x27;s corporate headquarters and New York City office, on the 101st to the 105th floors of 1 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan (2 to 6 floors above the impact zone of American Airlines Flight 11), were destroyed during the September 11, 2001 attacks. At 8:46:46 a.m., eighteen seconds after the plane struck the tower, a Goldman Sachs server issued an alert saying that its trading system had gone offline because it could not connect with the server. Since all stairwells leading past the impact zone were destroyed by the initial crash or blocked with smoke, fire, or debris, every employee who reported for work that morning was killed in the attacks; 658 of its 960 New York employees were killed or missing, or 68.5% of its total workforce, which was considerably more than any of the other World Trade Center tenants, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, or the Department of Defense. Forty-six contractors, food service workers, and visitors in the Cantor Fitzgerald offices at the time were also killed. CEO Howard Lutnick was not present that day, but his younger brother, Gary, was among those killed. Lutnick vowed to keep the company alive, and the company was able to bring its trading markets back online within a week.

On September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25% of the firm&#x27;s profits for the next five years, and it committed to paying for ten years of health care for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, eSpeed, and TradeSpark employees (profits that would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald partners). In 2006, the company had completed its promise, having paid a total of $180 million (and an additional $17 million from a relief fund run by Lutnick&#x27;s sister, Edie).

Until the attacks, Cantor had handled about a quarter of the daily transactions in the multi-trillion dollar treasury security market. Cantor Fitzgerald has since rebuilt its infrastructure, partly through the efforts of its London office, and now has its headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. The company&#x27;s effort to regain its footing was the subject of Tom Barbash&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, and 9/11: A Story of Loss and Renewal&quot; as well as a 2012 documentary, &quot;Out of the Clear Blue Sky&quot;.

On September 2, 2004, Cantor and other organizations filed a civil lawsuit against Saudi Arabia for allegedly providing money to the hijackers and al-Qaeda. It was later joined in the suit by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Most of the claims against Saudi Arabia were dismissed on January 18, 2005.

In December 2013, Cantor Fitzgerald settled its lawsuit against American Airlines for $135 million. Cantor Fitzgerald had been suing for loss of property and interruption of business by alleging the airline to have been negligent by allowing hijackers to board Flight 11.

==Recent history==
In 2003, the firm launched its fixed-income sales and trading group. Three years later, the Federal Reserve added Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. to its list of primary dealers. The firm later launched Cantor Prime Services in 2009. It was meant to be a provider of multi-asset, perimeter brokerage prime brokerage platforms to exploit its clearing, financing, and execution capabilities. A year after, Cantor Fitzgerald began building its real estate business with the launch of CCRE. Cantor&#x27;s affiliate, BGC Partners, expanded into commercial real estate services in 2011 by its purchase of Newmark Knight Frank and the assets of Grubb &amp; Ellis, to form Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.

On December 5, 2014, two Cantor Fitzgerald analysts were said to be in the top 25 analysts on TipRanks. Cantor Fitzgerald has a prolific special-purpose acquisition company underwriting practice, having led all banks in SPAC underwriting activity in both 2018 and 2019.

In March 2016, Sage Kelly, formerly of Jefferies &amp; Co., joined the firm as senior managing director and head of its investment-banking division.

==Philanthropy==
Edie wrote &quot;An Unbroken Bond: The Untold Story of How the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald Families Faced the Tragedy of 9/11 and Beyond&quot;. All proceeds from the book&#x27;s sale benefit the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and the charities it assists.

The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund provided $10 million to families affected by Hurricane Sandy. Howard Lutnick and the Relief Fund &quot;adopted&quot; 19 elementary schools in impacted areas by distributing $1,000 prepaid debit cards to each family from the schools. A total of $10 million in funds was given to families affected by the storm.

Two days after the 2013 Moore tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, killing 24 people and injuring hundreds, Lutnick pledged to donate $2 million to families affected by the tornado. The donation was given to families in the form of $1,000 debit cards.

Each year, on September 11, Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate, BGC Partners, donate 100% of their revenue to charitable causes on their annual Charity Day, which was initially established to raise money to assist the families of the Cantor employees who died in the World Trade Center attacks. Since its inception, Charity Day has raised $192 million for charities globally.

<doc id="6641" wikidata="Q321087" url="?curid=6641" title="Cane toad">
<text>The cane toad (Rhinella marina), also known as the giant neotropical toad or marine toad, is a large, terrestrial true toad native to South and mainland Central America, but which has been introduced to various islands throughout Oceania and the Caribbean, as well as Northern Australia. It is a member of the genus &quot;Rhinella&quot;, which includes many true toad species found throughout Central and South America, but it was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Bufo&quot;.

A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene in Colombia is morphologically indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the &quot;R. marina&quot; habitat preferences have long been for open areas. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump spawns with thousands of eggs. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among anurans, of both dead and living matter. Adults average in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of .

The cane toad has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Its toxic skin can kill many animals, both wild and domesticated, and cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs. Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural pest control. The common name of the species is derived from its use against the cane beetle (&quot;Dermolepida albohirtum&quot;), which damages sugar cane. The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions. The 1988 film &quot;Cane Toads: An Unnatural History&quot; documented the trials and tribulations of the introduction of cane toads in Australia.

==Taxonomy==
Historically, the cane toad was used to eradicate pests from sugarcane, giving rise to its common name. The cane toad has many other common names, including &quot;giant toad&quot; and &quot;marine toad&quot;; the former refers to its size, and the latter to the binomial name, &quot;R. marina&quot;. It was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1758). Linnaeus based the specific epithet &quot;marina&quot; on an illustration by Dutch zoologist Albertus Seba, who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments. Other common names include &quot;giant neotropical toad&quot;, &quot;Dominican toad&quot;, &quot;giant marine toad&quot;, and &quot;South American cane toad&quot;. In Trinidadian English, they are commonly called &quot;crapaud&quot;, the French word for toad.

The genus &quot;Rhinella&quot; is considered to constitute a distinct genus of its own, thus changing the scientific name of the cane toad. In this case, the specific name &quot;marinus&quot; (masculine) changes to &quot;marina&quot; (feminine) to conform with the rules of gender agreement as set out by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, changing the binomial name from &quot;Bufo marinus&quot; to &quot;Rhinella marina&quot;; the binomial &quot;Rhinella marinus&quot; was subsequently introduced as a synonym through misspelling by Pramuk, Robertson, Sites, and Noonan (2008). Though controversial (with many traditional herpetologists still using &quot;Bufo marinus&quot;) the binomial &quot;Rhinella marina&quot; is gaining in acceptance with such bodies as the IUCN, Encyclopaedia of Life, Amphibian Species of the World and increasing numbers of scientific publications adopting its usage.

Since 2016, cane toad populations native to Mesoamerica and northwestern South America are sometimes considered to be a separate species, &quot;Rhinella horribilis&quot;.

In Australia, the adults may be confused with large native frogs from the genera &quot;Limnodynastes&quot;, &quot;Cyclorana&quot;, and &quot;Mixophyes&quot;. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad by the absence of large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (&quot;Heleioporus australiacus&quot;), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may be confused with species of the genus &quot;Uperoleia&quot;, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.

In the United States, the cane toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, it could be confused with the southern toad (&quot;Bufo terrestris&quot;), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.

===Taxonomy and evolution===
The cane toad genome has been sequenced and certain Australian academics believe this will help in understanding how the toad can quickly evolve to adapt to new environments, the workings of its infamous toxin, and hopefully provide new options for halting this species&#x27; march across Australia and other places it has spread as an invasive pest.

Studies of the genome confirm its evolutionary origins in northern part of South America and its close genetic relation to &quot;Rhinella diptycha&quot; and other similar species of the genus. Recent studies suggest that &quot;R. marina&quot; diverged between 2.75 and 9.40 million years ago.

A recent split in the species into further subspecies may have occurred approximately 2.7 million years ago following the isolation of population groups by the rising Venezuelan Andes.

==Description==
Considered the largest species in the Bufonidae, the cane toad is very large; the females are significantly longer than males, reaching a typical length of , with a maximum of . Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density. They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years in the wild, and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35 years.

The skin of the cane toad is dry and warty. Distinct ridges above the eyes run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.

Typically, juvenile cane toads have smooth, dark skin, although some specimens have a red wash. Juveniles lack the adults&#x27; large parotoid glands, so they are usually less poisonous. The tadpoles are small and uniformly black, and are bottom-dwellers, tending to form schools. Tadpoles range from in length.

==Ecology, behaviour and life history==

The common name &quot;marine toad&quot; and the scientific name &quot;Rhinella marina&quot; suggest a link to marine life, but cane toads do not live in the sea. However, laboratory experiments suggest that tadpoles can tolerate salt concentrations equivalent to 15% of seawater (~5.4‰), and recent field observations found living tadpoles and toadlets at salinities of 27.5‰ on Coiba Island, Panama. The cane toad inhabits open grassland and woodland, and has displayed a &quot;distinct preference&quot; for areas modified by humans, such as gardens and drainage ditches. In their native habitats, the toads can be found in subtropical forests, although dense foliage tends to limit their dispersal.

The cane toad begins life as an egg, which is laid as part of long strings of jelly in water. A female lays 8,000–25,000 eggs at once and the strings can stretch up to in length. The black eggs are covered by a membrane and their diameter is about . The rate at which an egg grows into a tadpole increases with temperature. Tadpoles typically hatch within 48 hours, but the period can vary from 14 hours to almost a week. This process usually involves thousands of tadpoles—which are small, black, and have short tails—forming into groups. Between 12 and 60 days are needed for the tadpoles to develop into juveniles, with four weeks being typical. Similarly to their adult counterparts, eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals.

When they emerge, toadlets typically are about in length, and grow rapidly. While the rate of growth varies by region, time of year, and sex, an average initial growth rate of per day is seen, followed by an average rate of per day. Growth typically slows once the toads reach sexual maturity. This rapid growth is important for their survival; in the period between metamorphosis and subadulthood, the young toads lose the toxicity that protected them as eggs and tadpoles, but have yet to fully develop the parotoid glands that produce bufotoxin. Only an estimated 0.5% of cane toads reach adulthood, in part because they lack this key defense—but also due to tadpole cannibalism. Although cannibalism does occur in the native population in South America, the rapid evolution occurring in the unnaturally large population in Australia has produced tadpoles 30x more likely to be &quot;interested&quot; in cannibalising their siblings, and 2.6x more likely to actually &quot;do so&quot;. They have also evolved to shorten their tadpole phase in response to the presence of older tadpoles. These changes are likely genetic, although no genetic basis has been determined.

As with rates of growth, the point at which the toads become sexually mature varies across different regions. In New Guinea, sexual maturity is reached by female toads with a snout–vent length between , while toads in Panama achieve maturity when they are between in length. In tropical regions, such as their native habitats, breeding occurs throughout the year, but in subtropical areas, breeding occurs only during warmer periods that coincide with the onset of the wet season.

The cane toad is estimated to have a critical thermal maximum of and a minimum of around . The ranges can change due to adaptation to the local environment. Cane toads from some populations can adjust their thermal tolerance within a few hours of encountering low temperatures. The toad is able to rapidly acclimate to the cold using physiological plasticity, though there is also evidence that more northerly populations of cane toads in the United States are better cold-adapted than more southerly populations. These adaptations have allowed the cane toad to establish invasive populations across the world. The toad&#x27;s ability to rapidly acclimate to thermal changes suggests that current models may underestimate the potential range of habitats that the toad can populate. The cane toad has a high tolerance to water loss; some can withstand a 52.6% loss of body water, allowing them to survive outside tropical environments.

===Diet===
Most frogs identify prey by movement, and vision appears to be the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, it can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, other small mammals, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates (such as ants, beetles, earwigs, dragonflies, grasshoppers, true bugs, crustaceans, and gastropods), they also eat plants, dog food, cat food, feces, and household refuse.

===Defences===
The skin of the adult cane toad is toxic, as well as the enlarged parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across its back. When the toad is threatened, its glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads. Dogs are especially prone to be poisoned by licking or biting toads. Pets showing excessive drooling, extremely red gums, head-shaking, crying, loss of coordination, and/or convulsions require immediate veterinary attention.

Bufotenin, one of the chemicals excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a schedule 9 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and LSD. The effects of bufotenin are thought to be similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.

In addition to releasing toxin, the cane toad is capable of inflating its lungs, puffing up, and lifting its body off the ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator.

Since 2011, experimenters in the Kimberley region of Western Australia have used poisonous sausages containing toad meat in an attempt to protect native animals from cane toads&#x27; deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, along with the University of Sydney, developed these sausage-shaped baits as a tool in order to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals to stay away from the amphibians.

Young cane toads that aren&#x27;t lethal upon ingestion have also been used to teach native predators avoidance, namely yellow-spotted monitors. 200,000 metamorphs, tadpoles, and eggs in total were released in areas ahead of inevitable invasion fronts. Following invasion by wild cane toads, yellow-spotted monitors in control areas bereft of the &quot;teacher toads&quot; were virtually wiped out, but experimental areas still contained substantial populations of yellow-spotted monitors.

===Predators===

Many species prey on the cane toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, including the broad-snouted caiman (&quot;Caiman latirostris&quot;), the banded cat-eyed snake (&quot;Leptodeira annulata&quot;), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, and &quot;Paraponera clavata&quot; (bullet ants).

Predators outside the cane toad&#x27;s native range include the rock flagtail (&quot;Kuhlia rupestris&quot;), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), the whistling kite (&quot;Haliastur sphenurus&quot;), the rakali (&quot;Hydromys chrysogaster&quot;), the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) and the water monitor (&quot;Varanus salvator&quot;). The tawny frogmouth (&quot;Podargus strigoides&quot;) and the Papuan frogmouth (&quot;Podargus papuensis&quot;) have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows (&quot;Corvus&quot; spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their backs. Kookaburras also prey on the amphibians.

Opossums of the genus &quot;Didelphis&quot; likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads&#x27; toxins, so are able to kill them. The cane toad&#x27;s normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill or repel the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad. Saw-shelled turtles have also been seen successfully and safely eating cane toads.

In Australia rakali (Australian water rats) in two years learnt how to eat cane toads safely. They select the largest toads, turn them over, remove the poisonous gallbladder, and eat the heart and other organs with &quot;surgical precision&quot;. They remove the toxic skin and eat the thigh muscle. Other animals such as crows and kites turn cane toads inside out and eat non-poisonous organs, also thus avoiding the skin.

==Distribution==
The cane toad is native to the Americas, and its range stretches from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, and some of the continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.

===As an introduced species===
The cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the world—particularly the Pacific—for the biological control of agricultural pests. These introductions have generally been well documented, and the cane toad may be one of the most studied of any introduced species.

Before the early 1840s, the cane toad had been introduced into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 in an attempt to reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.

As a result, many countries in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. Introduced populations are in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Daitō Islands of Japan, Taiwan Nantou Caotun, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses a serious threat to native animals.

===Australia===
Following the apparent success of the cane toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaiʻi and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad to be released in Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaiʻi and brought to Australia. Queensland&#x27;s sugar scientists released the toad into cane fields in August 1935. After this initial release, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.

However, the toad was generally unsuccessful in reducing the targeted grey-backed cane beetles (&quot;Dermolepida albohirtum&quot;), in part because the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, and in part because the beetles live at the tops of sugar cane—and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards &quot;Varanus mertensi&quot;, &quot;V. mitchelli&quot;, and &quot;V. panoptes&quot;, the land snakes &quot;Pseudechis australis&quot; and &quot;Acanthophis antarcticus&quot;, and the freshwater crocodile species &quot;Crocodylus johnstoni&quot;; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard &quot;Amphibolurus gilberti&quot;—known to be a prey item of &quot;V. panoptes&quot;—has increased. Meat ants, however, are able to kill cane toads. The cane toad has also been linked to decreases in northern quolls in the southern region of Kakadu National Park and even their local extinction.

===Caribbean===
The cane toad was introduced to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While it was able to establish itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.

The earliest recorded introductions were to Barbados and Martinique. The Barbados introductions were focused on the biological control of pests damaging the sugarcane crops, and while the toads became abundant, they have done even less to control the pests than in Australia. The toad was introduced to Martinique from French Guiana before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the mosquito and mole cricket populations. A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no significant effect on the rats, they nevertheless became well established. Other introductions include the release on Antigua—possibly before 1916, although this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date—and Montserrat, which had an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the Soufrière Hills volcano eruption in 1995.

In 1920, the cane toad was introduced into Puerto Rico to control the populations of white grub (&quot;Phyllophaga&quot; spp.), a sugarcane pest. Before this, the pests were manually collected by humans, so the introduction of the toad eliminated labor costs. A second group of toads was imported in 1923, and by 1932, the cane toad was well established. The population of white grubs dramatically decreased, and this was attributed to the cane toad at the annual meeting of the International Sugar Cane Technologists in Puerto Rico. However, there may have been other factors. The six-year period after 1931—when the cane toad was most prolific, and the white grub had a dramatic decline—had the highest-ever rainfall for Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, the cane toad was assumed to have controlled the white grub; this view was reinforced by a &quot;Nature&quot; article titled &quot;Toads save sugar crop&quot;, and this led to large-scale introductions throughout many parts of the Pacific.

The cane toad has been spotted in Carriacou and Dominica, the latter appearance occurring in spite of the failure of the earlier introductions. On September 8, 2013, the cane toad was also discovered on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas.

===The Philippines===
The cane toad was first introduced deliberately into the Philippines in 1930 as a biological control agent of pests in sugarcane plantations, after the success of the experimental introductions into Puerto Rico. It subsequently became the most ubiquitous amphibian in the islands. It still retains the common name of &quot;bakî&quot; or &quot;kamprag&quot; in the Visayan languages, a corruption of &#x27;American frog&#x27;, referring to its origins. It is also commonly known as &quot;bullfrog&quot; in Philippine English.

===Fiji===
The cane toad was introduced into Fiji to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations. The introduction of the cane toad to the region was first suggested in 1933, following the successes in Puerto Rico and Hawaiʻi. After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawaiʻi. Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded, as the toad&#x27;s diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered &quot;economically neutral&quot;. Today, the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions.

===New Guinea===
The cane toad was introduced into New Guinea to control the hawk moth larvae eating sweet potato crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawaiʻi, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of toads being used for human pregnancy tests—many species of toad were found to be effective for this task, and were employed for about 20 years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.

===United States===
The cane toad naturally exists in South Texas, but attempts (both deliberate and accidental) have been made to introduce the species to other parts of the country. These include introductions to Florida and to Hawaiʻi, as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to Louisiana.

Initial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, intended to control sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way. However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at Miami International Airport in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida. Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the Keys to north of Tampa, and they are gradually extending further northward. In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to native species and pets; so much so, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recommends residents to kill them.

Around 150 cane toads were introduced to Oʻahu in Hawaiʻi in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17 months. The toads were sent to the other islands, and more than 100,000 toads were distributed by July 1934; eventually over 600,000 were transported.

==Uses==

Other than the use as a biological control for pests, the cane toad has been employed in a number of commercial and noncommercial applications. Traditionally, within the toad&#x27;s natural range in South America, the Embera-Wounaan would &quot;milk&quot; the toads for their toxin, which was then employed as an arrow poison. The toxins may have been used as an entheogen by the Olmec people. The toad has been hunted as a food source in parts of Peru, and eaten after the careful removal of the skin and parotoid glands. When properly prepared, the meat of the toad is considered healthy and as a source of omega-3 fatty acids. More recently, the toad&#x27;s toxins have been used in a number of new ways: bufotenin has been used in Japan as an aphrodisiac and a hair restorer, and in cardiac surgery in China to lower the heart rates of patients. New research has suggested that the cane toad&#x27;s poison may have some applications in treating prostate cancer.

Other modern applications of the cane toad include pregnancy testing, as pets, laboratory research, and the production of leather goods. Pregnancy testing was conducted in the mid-20th century by injecting urine from a woman into a male toad&#x27;s lymph sacs, and if spermatozoa appeared in the toad&#x27;s urine, the patient was deemed to be pregnant. The tests using toads were faster than those employing mammals; the toads were easier to raise, and, although the initial 1948 discovery employed &quot;Bufo arenarum&quot; for the tests, it soon became clear that a variety of anuran species were suitable, including the cane toad. As a result, toads were employed in this task for around 20 years. As a laboratory animal, the cane toad has numerous advantages: they are plentiful, and easy and inexpensive to maintain and handle. The use of the cane toad in experiments started in the 1950s, and by the end of the 1960s, large numbers were being collected and exported to high schools and universities. Since then, a number of Australian states have introduced or tightened importation regulations.

There are several commercial uses for dead cane toads. Cane toad skin is made into leather and novelty items. Stuffed cane toads, posed and accessorised, are merchandised at souvenir shops for tourists. Attempts have been made to produce fertiliser from toad carcasses.

<text>Croquet ( or ) is a sport which involves hitting wooden, plastic, or composite balls with a mallet through hoops (often called &quot;wickets&quot; in the United States) embedded in a grass playing court.

==Variations==
In all forms of croquet, individual players or teams take turns striking the balls, scoring points by knocking them through a hoop. The game ends when a player or team reaches a predetermined number of points. Several variations exist that differ in when and how a stroke may be legally played, when points are scored, the layout of the lawn, and the target score. Commonly, social games adopt further non-standard variations to adapt play to the conditions. In all versions, players of all ages and genders compete on equal terms and are ranked together.

Two versions of the game are directly governed by the World Croquet Federation, which organises individual and team World Championships. Other regional variants which developed in parallel remain common in parts of the world.

===Association croquet===

Association croquet is played between two individuals or teams, each playing with two balls. The object of the game is to be the first to strike each of their balls through all six hoops in both directions, in a fixed order, and to strike the central peg. Each of these actions scores a point, with the maximum score being 26 points.

The first four turns must be taken to play the four balls onto the lawn from one of two &quot;baulk lines&quot; defined as one yard into the lawn on the western half of the south boundary and the eastern half of the north boundary. After this, players elect at the start of each turn which of their two balls to play for the duration of that turn.

During a turn, a player may earn extra shots in two ways. A player earns a single extra shot by scoring a hoop point (hitting the striker&#x27;s ball through a hoop), or two extra shots by causing their ball to contact another ball-an action called a &quot;roquet&quot;. When a roquet is made, the player may pick up their ball and place it in contact with the roqueted ball. The next shot must move both the player&#x27;s ball and the roqueted ball, and it is the &quot;croquet&quot; stroke that gives the game its name. After a successful croquet stroke, the player has a single further shot, known as the &quot;continuation&quot;. During a turn, each of the other three balls may only be croqueted once between hoop points, but by stringing together a series of roquets, croquets, and scored hoops, several points may be scored in a single turn.

Advanced variants of association croquet give further penalties to dissuade skilled players from running every hoop with a ball on a single , while handicap versions give weaker players chances to continue play after making an error. The extra turns, called &quot;bisques&quot; are effective in levelling the odds of winning.

===Golf croquet===
Golf croquet is played between two individuals or teams, each playing with two balls. The object of the game is to reach a certain number of points, typically seven, earned by being the first to run a hoop.

The game opens by playing each ball into the lawn from the fourth (south-eastern) corner of the lawn. Balls must be played in order (for the primary ball colours, this is blue, red, black, and yellow), and this order of play is maintained throughout the game. Hoops are contested in a fixed order, with a point awarded to the owner of the first ball to pass through the hoop in the correct direction. After a point is awarded, all players move on to contest the next hoop. Balls that are played more than halfway to the next hoop before a point is scored are considered offside, and are moved to penalty areas.

Golf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game, owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness. There is an especially large interest in competitive success among players in Egypt. By comparison with association croquet, golf croquet requires a smaller variety of shots and emphasises strategic skills and accurate shot-making. Games are shorter, balls are more likely to be hit harder, and &#x27;jump&#x27; shots are more likely to be witnessed, where a ball is played to deliberately jump off the ground and over another ball.

===Five hoop croquet===
Five hoop croquet is a variation of Golf Croquet created to provide a simple introduction of Golf Croquet to new players. It follows the key principles of Golf Croquet but only plays the first 5 hoops. The winner is the player or team to reach a score of 3 hoops first. This version takes around 15 minutes to play and is normally played on a quarter size croquet lawn. It was originally created to be used for croquet events but has grown in popularity and is now played by many clubs when introducing new members.

===American six-wicket===
The American-rules version of croquet is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in Canada. It is governed by the United States Croquet Association. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American &quot;backyard&quot; croquet. Official rules were first published in 1894 by the Spalding Athletic Library, as adopted by the National American Croquet Association.

American six-wicket uses the same six-wicket layout as both association croquet and golf croquet, and is also played by two individuals or teams, each owning two balls.

Like association croquet, the object of the game is to be the first to pass each of their balls through all six hoops in both directions and to strike the central peg, for a total of 26 points. Unlike association croquet, balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow). The limitation of roqueting each ball once between hoop points is, unlike in association croquet, carried over from turn to turn until the ball scores the next hoop. In American six-wicket, this is termed &quot;deadness&quot;, and a separate board is required to keep track of the deadness for all four balls. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet. In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop so that the ball goes out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only from the boundary rather than as in association croquet. &quot;Attacking&quot; balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.

===Nine-wicket===
Nine-wicket croquet, sometimes called &quot;backyard croquet&quot;, is played mainly in Canada and the United States and is the game most recreational players in those countries call simply &quot;croquet&quot;. In this version of croquet, there are nine wickets, two stakes, and up to six balls. The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course. Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to end. If playing individually (&quot;Cutthroat&quot;), the first player to stake out is the winner. In partnership play, all members of a team must stake out, and a player might choose to avoid staking out (becoming a &quot;Rover&quot;) in order to help a lagging teammate.

Each time a ball is roqueted, the striker gets two bonus shots.
For the first bonus shot, the player has four options:
* From a mallet-head distance or less away from the ball that was hit (&quot;taking a mallet-head&quot;)
* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker&#x27;s ball held steady by the striker&#x27;s foot or hand (a &quot;foot shot&quot; or &quot;hand shot&quot;)
* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker&#x27;s ball not held by foot or hand (a &quot;croquet shot&quot;)
* From where the striker ball stopped after the roquet
The second bonus shot (&quot;continuation shot&quot;) is an ordinary shot played from where the striker ball came to rest.

An alternative endgame is &quot;poison&quot;: in this variant, a player who has scored the last wicket but not hit the starting stake becomes a &quot;poison ball&quot;, which may eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them. A non-poison ball that roquets a poison ball has the normal options. A poison ball that hits a stake or passes through any wicket (possibly through the action of a non-poison player) is eliminated. The last person remaining is the winner.

The Richmond Virginia Extreme Croquet Club has these rules:

• Revert Rule: If a ball traverses its prior wicket in the opposite direction, this now becomes its current wicket; exceptions: (1) a rover cannot be reverted; (2) until the ball remakes that wicket, it cannot be reverted again.

• Nosering Rule (an admittedly stupid name, the origin lost to history): Once per game, or sometimes once per half, at the end of one&#x27;s turn, one may move one&#x27;s ball exactly one mallet head, except not into or thru any wicket in either direction, and not to be touching either stake. In a team game, one may use a teammate&#x27;s unused nosering move.

• Alzheimer&#x27;s Rule: Before or after hitting the ball, if that player or anyone else realizes that the player forgot their current wicket, stake, or other mandatory objective, the hit is retaken (if in fact it has been taken), except when croqueting another ball; all players have the obligation to point this out before the hit.

• Act of Dog: If a player&#x27;s ball is relocated by an unleashed dog, it shall be played from the location the dog released the ball. If the ball is released out of bounds, then the ball shall be played from the point (after adjusting for a mallet width from the boundary) it was removed from the field.

• Dynamic Starting Order: After lagging to the stake for starting order, the players exercise the option to go or not go in order of closeness; after each player goes, the remaining players re-choose who goes next in the same order.

• McKlintoc Start, an option to start the game: A ball still on start 1-out or 2-out cannot be used to roquet another ball, nor can it be roquet&#x27;d without its owner&#x27;s permission. Nevertheless, such a ball may hit any other ball or be hit by any other ball; however, the hitter&#x27;s go is over and no deadness is established.
==International Croquet==
International Croquet is governed by the World Croquet Federation, often referred to as the WCF. The European Regional Committee is a subsidiary of the WCF set up to manage European croquet tournaments and provide a closer link to European Clubs in the management of international croquet.

As well as club-level games, county-level tournaments, and leagues, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, Spain, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Egypt; many other countries also play. Every four years, the top countries play in the World Team Championships in AC (the MacRobertson Shield) and GC (the Openshaw Shield). The current world rankings show England in top place for AC, followed by Australia in second place, and New Zealand in third place, with the United States in fourth position. The same four countries appear in the top six of the GC country rankings, below Egypt in top position, and with Spain at number six.

Individual World Championships usually take place every two or three years. The 2023 AC World Championships took place in London; the winner was Robert Fulford. The current Women&#x27;s Association Croquet World Champion (2023) is Debbie Lines of England.

The most prestigious international team competition in association croquet is the MacRobertson International Croquet Shield. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, England (formerly Great Britain), the United States, and New Zealand. Other nations compete in Tier 2 and Tier 3 World Team Championships. Teams are promoted and relegated between the lower tiers, but there is no relegation to or promotion from the MacRobertson Shield. The current holders of the MacRobertson Shield are England, who won the title in 2023. At the Golf Croquet World Team Championships, eight nations contest the Openshaw Shield. There is promotion and relegation between Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. The current holders of the Openshaw Shield are New Zealand, who won in 2020. The world&#x27;s top 10 association croquet players as of October 2023 were Robert Fletcher (Australia), Robert Fulford (England), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), Jamie Burch (England), Reg Bamford (South Africa), Matthew Essick (USA), Mark Avery (England), Simon Hockey (Australia), Harry Fisher (England), and Jose Riva (Spain).

In April 2013, Reg Bamford of South Africa beat Ahmed Nasr of Egypt in the final of the Golf Croquet World Championship in Cairo, becoming the first person to simultaneously hold the title in both association croquet and golf croquet. As of 2023, the Golf Croquet World Champion was Matthew Essick (USA), and the Women&#x27;s Golf Croquet World Champion was Jamie Gumbrell (Australia). In 2018, two international championships open to both sexes were won by women: in May, Rachel Gee of England beat Pierre Beaudry of Belgium to win the European Golf Croquet championship, and in October, Hanan Rashad of Egypt beat Yasser Fathy (also from Egypt) to win the World over-50s Golf Croquet championship.

Croquet was an event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Roque, an American variation on croquet, was an event at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Croquet is recognized as the first Olympic sport to include female participants. In the 1900 Olympic croquet events, France claimed victory in all three competitions. Gaston Aumoitte won the one-ball singles, Chrétien Waydelich won the two-ball singles, and the doubles event was won by the pair of Gaston Aumoitte and Georges Johin, securing all the medals as all 10 participants were French.

==History==

The oldest document to bear the word &quot;croquet&quot; with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers&#x27; Company of London. This record is now in the Public Record Office. In 1868, the first croquet all-comers meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, and in the same year, the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon, London.

Regardless of when and by what route it reached the British Isles and the British colonies in its recognizable form, croquet is, like pall-mall and trucco, among the later forms of ground billiards, which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages, with roots in classical antiquity, including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with balls and mallets or other striking sticks (some more akin to modern field hockey sticks). By the 12th century, a team ball game called &#x27; or &#x27;, akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football (depending on whether sticks were used), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283.

In the book &quot;Queen of Games: The History of Croquet&quot;, Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet, which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas.

===French origin theory===
The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1660–1685 reign of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland and was played under the name of &#x27; (among other spellings, today usually &quot;pall-mall&quot;), derived ultimately from Latin words for &#x27;ball and mallet&#x27; (the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game, &#x27;). This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, dated 1877.

In his 1801 book &quot;The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England&quot;, Joseph Strutt described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time:&quot;Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box[wood] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins. It is to be observed that there are two of these arches, that is, one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James&#x27;s Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.&quot;

While the name &quot;pall-mall&quot; and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere (France and Italy), the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century. Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance (as in golf); however, an image in Strutt&#x27;s 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game (balls on the ground, hoop, bats, and peg) being played over a , garden-sized distance. The image&#x27;s caption describes the game as &quot;a curious ancient pastime&quot;, confirming that croquet games were not new in early-19th-century England.
In Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1755 dictionary, his definition of &quot;pall-mall&quot; clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: &quot;A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring&quot;. However, there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke, which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game.

===Irish origin theory===
The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived in Ireland during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from Brittany, where a similar game was played on the beaches. Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. By no later than the early 15th century, the game &quot; (itself ancestral to pall-mall and perhaps to indoor billiards) was popular in France, including in the courts of Henry II in the 16th century and Louis XIV of the 17th.

At least one version of it, &quot; (&#x27;wheel&#x27;), was a multi-ball lawn game. Records show a game called &quot;crookey&quot;, similar to croquet, being played at Castlebellingham in County Louth, Ireland, in 1834, which was introduced to Galway in 1835 and played on the bishop&#x27;s palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of Kingstown (today Dún Laoghaire) where it was first spelled as &quot;croquet&quot;. There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way the game was played; in particular, there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke, which is described above under &quot;Variations: Association&quot;. The noted croquet historian Dr. Prior, in his book of 1872, makes the categorical statement, &quot;One thing only is certain: it is from Ireland that croquet came to England and it was on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale that it was first played in this country.&quot;

John Jaques apparently claimed in a letter to Arthur Lillie in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland, writing, &quot;I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr. Spratt [mentioned above] introduced the subject to me.&quot; Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.

===Heyday and decline===
Croquet became highly popular as a social pastime in England during the 1860s. It was enthusiastically adopted and promoted by the Earl of Essex, who held lavish croquet parties at Cassiobury House, his stately home in Watford, Hertfordshire, and the Earl even launched his own &quot;Cassiobury&quot; brand croquet set. By 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his &quot;Laws and Regulations&quot; of the game. It quickly spread to other Anglophone countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.

It is no coincidence that the game became popular at the same time as the cylinder lawn mower, since croquet can only be played well on a lawn that is flat and finely-cut.
By the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, lawn tennis, and many of the newly created croquet clubs, including the All England Club at Wimbledon, converted some or all of their lawns into tennis courts. There was a revival in the 1890s, but going forward croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. Its championship was won 38 times by Bernard Neal. The English headquarters for the game is now in Cheltenham.
The earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet &quot;The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations&quot;, which was published in the mid-1860s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the Earl of Eglinton. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of &quot;croquet&quot; in full swing.

The croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between Eglinton Castle and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named Captain Moreton&#x27;s Eglinton Castle croquet, which had small bells on the eight hoops &quot;to ring the changes&quot;, two pegs, a double hoop with a bell, and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865, the &#x27;Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet&#x27; was published by Edmund Routledge. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist, and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland.

==Glossary of terms==
;Backward ball: The ball of a side that has scored fewer hoops (compare with &#x27;forward ball&#x27;)
;Ball-in-hand: A ball that the striker can pick up to change its position, for example:
:# Any ball when it leaves the court has to be replaced on the yard-line
:# The striker&#x27;s ball after making a roquet must be placed in contact with the roqueted ball
:# The striker&#x27;s ball when the striker is entitled to a lift
;Ball in play: A ball after it has been played into the game, which is not a ball in hand or pegged out
;Baulk: An imaginary line on which a ball is placed for its first shot in the game, or when taking a lift: The A-baulk coincides with the western half of the yard line along the south boundary; the B-baulk occupies the eastern half of the north boundary yard line.
;Bisque, half-bisque: A bisque is a free turn in a handicap match. A half-bisque is a restricted handicap turn in which no point may be scored.
;Break down: To end a turn by making a mistake
;Cannon: In association croquet, a shot which results after a roqueted ball comes to rest in contact with another ball on the lawn: The laws allow for this third ball to also be moved on the resulting croquet stroke, staying in touch with the roqueted ball (on which the striker is now ball-in-hand). The croquet stroke with the three balls in contact is referred to as a &quot;cannon&quot;.
;Continuation stroke: Either the bonus stroke played after running a hoop in order or the second bonus stroke played after making a roquet
;Corner cannon: In association croquet, a cannon taken from a corner of the court : Corner cannons occur a good deal more frequently than other cannons because skilled players seek them out as a way of getting a ball out of a corner and into a break. The corner is a fairly large target into which to rush and set up a corner cannon.
;Croquet stroke: A stroke taken after making a roquet, in which the striker&#x27;s ball and the roqueted ball are placed together in contact
;Double tap: A fault in which the mallet makes more than one audible sound when it strikes the ball
;Double banking: The practice of playing 2 games of croquet simultaneously on the same lawn/court : This is done by using primary colours and secondary colours. When the two games impinge on each other players mark the balls to allow the other game to proceed.
;Dolly rush: A rush with a very short distance (a foot or less) between the balls; a dolly rush is easy to control and is generally considered quite desirable
;Forward ball: The ball of a player or team that has scored more hoops (compare with &#x27;backward ball&#x27;)
;Hit in: To make a roquet, usually at distance, which starts a break
;Hoop: Metal (inverted) U-shaped gate inserted into ground (also called a wicket in the US, which is of the same etymology as wicket gate)
;Leave: The position of the balls after a successful break, in which a player leaves the balls placed so as to make life as difficult as possible for the opponent and/or easy for themselves on the next turn if the opponent misses
;Lift: A turn in which the player is entitled to remove the ball from its current position and play instead from either baulk line; a lift is permitted when a ball has been placed by the opponent in a position where it is wired from all other balls, and also in advanced play when the opponent has completed a break that includes hoops 1-back or 4-back
;Object ball: A ball which is going to be rushed
;Peg out: To cause a rover ball to strike the peg and conclude its active involvement in the game
;Peel: To send a ball other than the striker&#x27;s ball through its next hoop in order
;Pioneer: A ball placed in a strategic position near the striker&#x27;s next-but-one or next-but-two hoop, to assist in running that hoop later in the break
;Primary colours or first colours: The main croquet ball colours used are blue, red, black and yellow. One player or team plays blue and black, the other red and yellow.
;Push: A fault when the mallet pushes the striker&#x27;s ball with an extended contact, rather than making a clean strike
;Roquet: (Second syllable rhymes with &quot;play&quot;) : When the striker&#x27;s ball hits a ball with which the player is entitled to then take a croquet shot, it is a roquet. At the start of a turn, the striker is entitled to roquet all the other three balls once. Once the striker&#x27;s ball goes through its target hoop, the player is again entitled to roquet the other balls once.
;Rover ball: A ball that has run all 12 hoops in order, and can therefore be pegged out
;Rover hoop: The last hoop, indicated by a red top bar; the first hoop has a blue top
;Run a hoop: To send the striker&#x27;s ball through a hoop; if the hoop is the hoop in order for the striker&#x27;s ball, the striker earns a bonus stroke
;Rush: A roquet when the roqueted ball is sent to a specific position on the court, such as the next hoop for the striker&#x27;s ball or close to a ball that the striker wishes to roquet next.
;Scatter shot: A continuation stroke used to hit a ball which may not be roqueted in order to send it to a less dangerous position
;Secondary colours: (Also known as second colours or alternate colours): The colours of the balls used in the second game played on the same court in double-banking are green, pink, brown and white. Green and brown versus pink and white, are played by the same player or pair.
;Sextuple peel (SXP): To peel the partner ball through its last six hoops in the course of a single turn; very few players have achieved this feat, but it is being seen increasingly at championship level
;Tice: A ball sent to a location that will entice an opponent to shoot at it but miss
;Triple peel (TP): To send a partner ball through its last three hoops, and then peg out both partner ball and striker&#x27;s ball, in the course of a single turn; see also Triple Peel : A variant is the Triple Peel on Opponent (TPO), where the opponent&#x27;s ball, rather than the partner ball, is peeled. The significance of this manoeuvre is that in advanced play, making a break that includes the tenth hoop (called 4-back) is penalized by granting the opponent a lift (entitling him to take the next shot from either baulk line). Therefore, many breaks stop voluntarily with three hoops and the peg still to run.
;Wired: When a hoop or the peg impedes the path of a striker&#x27;s ball, or the swing of the mallet, a player will often endeavour to finish a turn with the opponent&#x27;s balls wired from each other.
;Yard line: An imaginary line from the boundary; balls which go off the boundary are generally replaced on the yard line (but if this happens on a croquet stroke, the turn ends)

==In art and literature==


Croquet is popularly believed to be viciously competitive. That may derive from the fact that (unlike in golf) players will often attempt to move their opponents&#x27; balls to unfavourable positions. However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy; successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents.

The way croquet is depicted in paintings and books says much about popular perceptions of the game, though little about the reality of modern play.
* In 1868 a song titled &quot;Croquet&quot; (essentially anonymous: by M.B.C.S and W.O.F.) was included in a popular song book by W. O. Perkins, &quot;The Golden Robin&quot; (Pub. Oliver Ditson &amp; Company, New York). (&quot;Upon the smoothly shaven lawn, Beneath the skies of May, Oh, boys and girls, this merry morn, Come out and play Croquet ...&quot;); there are four full verses.
* Winslow Homer, Édouard Manet, and Pierre Bonnard all have paintings titled &quot;The Croquet Game.&quot;
* Norman Rockwell often depicted the game, including in his painting &quot;Croquet.&quot;
* Edward Gorey&#x27;s &quot;The Epiplectic Bicycle&quot; features illustrations of the main characters playing with croquet mallets.
* Croquet is popular pastime of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; characters.
* H. G. Wells wrote &quot;The Croquet Player&quot; which uses croquet as a metaphor for the way in which people confront the very problem of their own existence.

* Lewis Carroll featured a nonsense version of the game in the popular children&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;: a hedgehog was used as the ball, a flamingo as the mallet, and playing cards as the hoops.
* In the &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series of novels, notably &quot;Something Rotten&quot;, Jasper Fforde depicts an alternative world in which croquet is a brutal mass spectator sport.
* The cover of the 1971 Genesis album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; shows Cynthia, a character in the song &quot;Musical Box&quot; holding a croquet mallet with a few heads on the playing field including another character of the song Henry&#x27;s head that she removed with said mallet.
* In Stephen King&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Shining&quot;, the main character, Jack Torrance, uses a croquet mallet to chase and attack the other characters. The 1997 miniseries features the use of croquet however, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film adaptation uses a fire axe instead.
* In the 1980s geography game &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, one of the characters, Fast Eddie B, is described as a &quot;world class croquet player&quot;, and two other gang members, Ihor Ihorovich and Scar Graynolt, also play the sport.
* In the 1988 film &quot;Heathers&quot;, Veronica (Winona Ryder) and her friends, the Heathers, are depicted as playing croquet, though at the beginning, the Heathers are playing croquet to hit Veronica on the head. Croquet mallets also feature in the publicity posters for &quot;&quot;.
* Croquet is featured prominently in the music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Not Okay (I Promise)&quot; by My Chemical Romance.
* Croquet is featured in the novel &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck wherein the Joads stay at the government camp in Weedpatch, Ca.
* In the 1951 Woody Woodpecker animated short &quot;Wicket Wacky&quot;, Woody sneaks into a croquet field to play, while a gopher bothered by the noise tries to stop him.

==Clubs==
About 200 croquet clubs across the United States are members of the United States Croquet Association.

Many colleges have croquet clubs as well, such as The University of Virginia, The University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, Bates College, SUNY New Paltz, Harvard University, and Dartmouth College. Notably, St. John&#x27;s College and the US Naval Academy engage in a yearly match in Annapolis, Maryland. Both schools also compete at the collegiate level and the rivalry continues to be an Annapolis tradition, attracting thousands of spectators each April.

In England and Wales, there are over 200 clubs affiliated with Croquet England. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon is famous for its lawn tennis tournament, but retains an active croquet section. There are clubs in many universities and colleges, with an annual varsity match being played between Oxford and Cambridge. With over 1800 participants, the 2011 Oxford University &quot;Cuppers&quot; (inter-college) tournament claimed to be not only the largest croquet tournament ever, but the largest sporting event in the university&#x27;s history.

In Spain there are 37 clubs federated to the Federación Española de Croquet. Croquet is a growing sport in Spain with 4 new clubs joining the FEC in 2024.

There are 112 clubs in New Zealand, affiliated with 19 associations. They are governed by Croquet New Zealand.

<doc id="6644" wikidata="Q136851" url="?curid=6644" title="Curling">
<text>Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area that is segmented into four concentric circles. It is related to bowls, boules, and shuffleboard. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called &quot;rocks&quot;, across the ice &quot;curling sheet&quot; toward the &quot;house&quot;, a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones, with each player throwing two. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a &quot;game&quot;; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each &quot;end&quot;, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones once. A game usually consists of eight or ten ends.

Players induce a curved path, described as &quot;curl&quot;, by causing the stone to slowly rotate as it slides. The path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms or brushes, who accompany it as it slides down the sheet and sweep the ice in front of the stone. &quot;Sweeping a rock&quot; decreases the friction, which makes the stone travel a straighter path (with less curl) and a longer distance. A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result.

== History ==
Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 found (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland. The world&#x27;s oldest curling stone and the world&#x27;s oldest football are now kept in the same museum (the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum) in Stirling. The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, in February 1541. Two paintings, &quot;Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap&quot; and &quot;The Hunters in the Snow&quot; (both dated 1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, depict Flemish peasants curling, albeit without brooms; Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the history of golf.

The word &quot;curling&quot; first appears in print in 1620 in Perth, Scotland, in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson. The sport was (and still is, in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand) also known as &quot;the roaring game&quot; because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the &quot;pebble&quot; (droplets of water applied to the playing surface). The verbal noun &quot;curling&quot; is formed from the Scots (and English) verb &quot;curl&quot;, which describes the motion of the stone.

Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world, having been formally constituted in 1716; it is still in existence today. Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium, in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some in size. The International Olympic Committee recognises the Royal Caledonian Curling Club (founded as the Grand Caledonian Curling Club in 1838) as developing the first official rules for the sport. However, although not written as a &quot;rule book&quot;, this is preceded by Rev James Ramsay of Gladsmuir, a member of the Duddingston Curling Club, who wrote &quot;An Account of the Game of Curling&quot; in 1811, which speculates on its origin and explains the method of play.

In the early history of curling, the playing stones were simply flat-bottomed stones from rivers or fields, which lacked a handle and were of inconsistent size, shape, and smoothness. Some early stones had holes for a finger and the thumb, akin to ten-pin bowling balls. Unlike today, the thrower had little control over the &#x27;curl&#x27; or velocity and relied more on luck than on precision, skill, and strategy. The sport was often played on frozen rivers although purpose-built ponds were later created in many Scottish towns. For example, the Scottish poet David Gray describes whisky-drinking curlers on the Luggie Water at Kirkintilloch.

In Darvel, East Ayrshire, the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms&#x27; &quot;warp beams&quot;, fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose. Central Canadian curlers often used &#x27;irons&#x27; rather than stones until the early 1900s; Canada is the only country known to have done so, while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins.

Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter. Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling, the World Curling Federation in Perth, which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, the mother club of curling.

In the 19th century, several private railway stations in the United Kingdom were built to serve curlers attending bonspiels, such as those at Aboyne, Carsbreck, and Drummuir.

Today, the sport is most firmly established in Canada, having been taken there by Scottish emigrants. The Royal Montreal Curling Club, the oldest established sports club still active in North America, was established in 1807. The first curling club in the United States was established in 1830, and the sport was introduced to Switzerland and Sweden before the end of the 19th century, also by Scots. Today, curling is played all over Europe and has spread to Brazil, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Korea.

The first world championship for curling was limited to men and was known as the &quot;Scotch Cup&quot;, held in Falkirk and Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959. The first world title was won by the Canadian team from Regina, Saskatchewan, skipped by Ernie Richardson. (The &quot;skip&quot; is the team member who calls the shots; see below.)

=== Olympics ===

Curling has been a medal sport in the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics. It currently includes men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and mixed doubles tournaments (the mixed doubles event was held for the first time in 2018).

In February 2002, the International Olympic Committee retroactively decided that the curling competition from the 1924 Winter Olympics (originally called &quot;Semaine des Sports d&#x27;Hiver&quot;, or International Winter Sports Week) would be considered official Olympic events and no longer be considered demonstration events. Thus, the first Olympic medals in curling, which at the time was played outdoors, were retroactively awarded for the 1924 Winter Games, with the gold medal won by Great Britain, two silver medals by Sweden, and the bronze by France. A demonstration tournament was also held during the 1932 Winter Olympic Games between four teams from Canada and four from the United States, with Canada winning 12 games to 4.

Since the sport&#x27;s official addition in the 1998 Olympics, Canada has dominated the sport with their men&#x27;s teams winning gold in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and silver in 1998 and 2002. The women&#x27;s team won gold in 1998 and 2014, a silver in 2010, and a bronze in 2002 and 2006. The mixed doubles team won gold in 2018.

== Equipment ==
=== Curling sheet ===
The playing surface or &quot;curling sheet&quot; is defined by the World Curling Federation Rules of Curling. It is a rectangular area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, in length by in width. The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards.

A target, the &quot;house&quot;, is centred on the intersection of the &quot;centre line&quot;, drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet and the &quot;tee line&quot;, drawn from, and parallel to, the backboard. These lines divide the house into quarters. The house consists of a centre circle (the &quot;button&quot;) and three concentric rings, of diameters 4, 8, and 12 feet, formed by painting or laying a coloured vinyl sheet under the ice and are usually distinguished by colour. A stone must at least touch the outer ring in order to score (see Scoring below); otherwise, the rings are merely a visual aid for aiming and judging which stone is closer to the button.
Two &quot;hog lines&quot; are drawn from, and parallel to, the backboard.

The &quot;hacks&quot;, which give the thrower something to push against when making the throw, are fixed behind each button. On indoor rinks, there are usually two fixed hacks, rubber-lined holes, one on each side of the centre line, with the inside edge no more than from the centre line and the front edge on the hack line. A single moveable hack may also be used.

The ice may be natural, but is usually frozen by a refrigeration plant pumping a brine solution through numerous pipes fixed lengthwise at the bottom of a shallow pan of water. Most curling clubs have an ice maker whose main job is to care for the ice. At the major curling championships, ice maintenance is extremely important. Large events, such as national/international championships, are typically held in an arena that presents a challenge to the ice maker, who must constantly monitor and adjust the ice and air temperatures as well as air humidity levels to ensure a consistent playing surface. It is common for each sheet of ice to have multiple sensors embedded in order to monitor surface temperature, as well as probes set up in the seating area (to monitor humidity) and in the compressor room (to monitor brine supply and return temperatures). The surface of the ice is maintained at a temperature of around .

A key part of the preparation of the playing surface is the spraying of water droplets onto the ice, which form &quot;pebble&quot; on freezing. The pebbled ice surface resembles an orange peel, and the stone moves on top of the pebbled ice. The pebble, along with the concave bottom of the stone, decreases the friction between the stone and the ice, allowing the stone to travel further. As the stone moves over the pebble, any rotation of the stone causes it to &quot;curl&quot;, or travel along a curved path. The amount of curl (commonly referred to as the &quot;feet of curl&quot;) can change during a game as the pebble wears; the ice maker must monitor this and be prepared to scrape and re-pebble the surface prior to each game.

=== Curling stone ===
The curling stone (also sometimes called a &quot;rock&quot; in North America) is made of granite and is specified by the World Curling Federation, which requires a weight between , a maximum circumference of , and a minimum height of . The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the &quot;running surface&quot;, a narrow, flat annulus or ring, wide and about in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring, with the inside of the ring hollowed concave to clear the ice. This concave bottom was first proposed by J. S. Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay.

The granite for the stones comes from two sources: Ailsa Craig, an island located in the Firth of Clyde off the Ayrshire coast of Scotland, and the Trefor Granite Quarry, North of the Llŷn Peninsula, Gwynedd in Wales. These locations provide four variations in colour known as &quot;Ailsa Craig Common Green&quot;, &quot;Ailsa Craig Blue Hone&quot;, &quot;Blue Trefor&quot; and &quot;Red Trefor&quot;.

&quot;Blue Hone&quot; has very low water absorption, which prevents the action of repeatedly freezing water from eroding the stone. &quot;Ailsa Craig Common Green&quot; is a lesser quality granite than &quot;Blue Hone&quot;. In the past, most curling stones were made from &quot;Blue Hone&quot;, but the island is now a wildlife reserve, and the quarry is restricted by environmental conditions that exclude blasting.

Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones in Mauchline, Ayrshire, since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, granted by the Marquess of Ailsa, whose family has owned the island since 1560. According to the 1881 Census, Andrew Kay employed 30 people in his curling stone factory in Mauchline. The last harvest of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2013, after a hiatus of 11 years; 2,000 tons were harvested, sufficient to fill anticipated orders through at least 2020. Kays have been involved in providing curling stones for the Winter Olympics since Chamonix in 1924 and has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics since the 2006 Winter Olympics.

&quot;Trefor&quot; granite comes from the Yr Eifl or Trefor Granite Quarry in the village of Trefor on the north coast of the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales and has produced granite since 1850. &quot;Trefor&quot; granite comes in shades of pink, blue, and grey. The quarry supplies curling stone granite exclusively to the Canada Curling Stone Company, which has been producing stones since 1992 and supplied the stones for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

A handle is attached by a bolt running vertically through a hole in the centre of the stone. The handle allows the stone to be gripped and rotated upon release; on properly prepared ice the rotation will bend (&quot;curl&quot;) the path of the stone in the direction in which the front edge of the stone is turning, especially as the stone slows. Handles are coloured to identify each team, two popular colours in major tournaments being red and yellow.
In competition, an electronic handle known as the Eye on the Hog may be fitted to detect hog line violations. This electronically detects whether the thrower&#x27;s hand is in contact with the handle as it passes the hog line and indicates a violation by lights at the base of the handle (see &quot;delivery&quot; below). The &quot;eye on the hog&quot; eliminates human error and the need for hog line officials. It is mandatory in high-level national and international competition, but its cost, around US$650 each, currently puts it beyond the reach of most curling clubs.

=== Curling broom ===
The &quot;curling broom&quot;, or &quot;brush&quot;, is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone (see &quot;sweeping&quot;) and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.

Prior to the 1950s, most curling brooms were made of corn strands and were similar to household brooms of the day. In 1958, Fern Marchessault of Montreal inverted the corn straw in the centre of the broom. This style of corn broom was referred to as &quot;the Blackjack&quot;.

Artificial brooms made from human-made fabrics rather than corn, such as the &quot;Rink Rat&quot;, also became common later during this time period. Prior to the late sixties, &quot;Scottish&quot; curling brushes were used primarily by some of the Scots, as well as by recreational and elderly curlers, as a substitute for corn brooms, since the technique was easier to learn. In the late sixties, competitive curlers from Calgary, Alberta, such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by Paul Gowsell, proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to corn broom use. During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which sweeping device was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a corn broom on a regular basis.

Curling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads. Modern curling brush handles are usually hollow tubes made of fibreglass or carbon fibre instead of a solid length of wooden dowel. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and more downward force to be applied to the broom head with reduced shaft flex.
 In 2014, new &quot;directional fabric&quot; brooms were introduced, which could influence the path of a curling stone better than the existing brooms. Concerns arose that these brooms would alter the fundamentals of the sport by reducing the level of skill required and giving players an unfair advantage; at least thirty-four elite teams signed a statement pledging not to use them. This was dubbed the &quot;broomgate controversy&quot;. The new brooms were temporarily banned by the World Curling Federation and Curling Canada for the 2015–2016 season. Since 2016, only one standardized brush head is approved by the World Curling Federation for competitive play.

=== Shoes ===

Curling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except for special soles; the &quot;slider shoe&quot; (usually known as a &quot;slider&quot;) is designed for the sliding foot and the &quot;gripper shoe&quot; (usually known as a &quot;gripper&quot;) for the foot that kicks off from the hack.

The &quot;slider&quot; is designed to slide and typically has a Teflon sole. It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly. Stainless steel and &quot;red brick&quot; sliders with lateral blocks of PVC on the sole are also available as alternatives to Teflon. Most shoes have a full-sole sliding surface, but some shoes have a sliding surface covering only the outline of the shoe and other enhancements with the full-sole slider. Some shoes have small disc sliders covering the front and heel portions or only the front portion of the foot, which allow more flexibility in the sliding foot for curlers playing with tuck deliveries. When a player is not throwing, the player&#x27;s slider shoe can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on gripper. Ordinary athletic shoes may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.

The &quot;gripper&quot; is worn by the thrower on the foot that kicks off from the hack during delivery and is designed to grip the ice. It may have a normal athletic shoe sole or a special layer of rubbery material applied to the sole of a thickness to match the sliding shoe. The toe of the hack foot shoe may also have a rubberised coating on the top surface or a flap that hangs over the toe to reduce wear on the top of the shoe as it drags on the ice behind the thrower.

=== Other equipment ===
Other types of equipment include:

* Curling pants, made to be stretchy to accommodate the curling delivery.
* A stopwatch to time the stones over a fixed distance to calculate their speed. Stopwatches can be attached either to clothing or the broom.
* Curling gloves and mittens, to keep the hands warm and improve grip on the broom.

== Gameplay ==
The purpose of a game is to score points by getting stones closer to the house centre, or the &quot;button&quot;, than the other team&#x27;s stones. Players from either team alternate in taking shots from the far side of the sheet. An end is complete when all eight rocks from each team have been delivered, a total of sixteen stones. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, often extra ends are played to break the tie. The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see Scoring below). A game may be conceded if winning the game is infeasible.

International competitive games are generally ten ends, so most of the national championships that send a representative to the World Championships or Olympics also play ten ends. However, there is a movement on the World Curling Tour to make the games only eight ends. Most tournaments on that tour are eight ends, as are the vast majority of recreational games.

In international competition, each side is given 73 minutes to complete all of its throws. Each team is also allowed two minute-long timeouts per 10-end game. If extra ends are required, each team is allowed 10 minutes of playing time to complete its throws and one added 60-second timeout for each extra end. However, the &quot;thinking time&quot; system, in which the delivering team&#x27;s game timer stops as soon as the shooter&#x27;s rock crosses the t-line during the delivery, is becoming more popular, especially in Canada. This system allows each team 38 minutes per 10 ends, or 30 minutes per 8 ends, to make strategic and tactical decisions, with 4 minutes and 30 seconds an end for extra ends. The &quot;thinking time&quot; system was implemented after it was recognized that using shots which take more time for the stones to come to rest was being penalized in terms of the time the teams had available compared to teams which primarily use hits which require far less time per shot.

=== Delivery ===

The process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the &quot;delivery&quot; or &quot;throw&quot;. Players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the lead) throws, the players not delivering (the second and third) sweep (see Sweeping, below). When the skip throws, the vice-skip takes their role.

The &quot;skip&quot;, or the captain of the team, determines the desired stone placement and the required &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, and &quot;line&quot; that will allow the stone to stop there. The placement will be influenced by the tactics at this point in the game, which may involve taking out, blocking, or tapping another stone.
* The &quot;weight&quot; of the stone is its velocity, which depends on the leg drive of the delivery rather than the arm.
* The &quot;turn&quot; or &quot;curl&quot; is the rotation of the stone, which gives it a curved trajectory.
* The &quot;line&quot; is the direction of the throw ignoring the effect of the &quot;turn&quot;.

The skip may communicate the &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, &quot;line,&quot; and other tactics by calling or tapping a broom on the ice. In the case of a takeout, guard, or a tap, the skip will indicate the stones involved.

Before delivery, the running surface of the stone is wiped clean and the path across the ice swept with the broom if necessary, since any dirt on the bottom of a stone or in its path can alter the trajectory and ruin the shot. Intrusion by a foreign object is called a &quot;pick-up&quot; or &quot;pick&quot;.


The thrower starts from the &quot;hack&quot;. The thrower&#x27;s &quot;gripper&quot; shoe (with the non-slippery sole) is positioned against one of the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice versa for a left-hander. The thrower, now &quot;in the hack&quot;, lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip&#x27;s broom at the far end for &quot;line&quot;.

The stone is placed in front of the foot now in the hack. Rising slightly from the hack, the thrower pulls the stone back (some older curlers may actually raise the stone in this backward movement) then lunges smoothly out from the hack pushing the stone ahead while the slider foot is moved in front of the gripper foot, which trails behind. The thrust from this lunge determines the &quot;weight&quot;, and hence the distance the stone will travel. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides. One older writer suggests the player keep &quot;a basilisk glance&quot; at the mark.

There are two common types of delivery currently, the typical flat-foot delivery and the Manitoba tuck delivery where the curler slides on the front ball of their foot.

When the player releases the stone, a rotation (called the &quot;turn)&quot; is imparted by a slight clockwise or counter-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o&#x27;clock position to the twelve o&#x27;clock on release. A typical rate of turn is about rotations before coming to a rest.

The stone must be released before its front edge crosses the near hog line. In major tournaments, the &quot;Eye on the Hog&quot; sensor is commonly used to enforce this rule. The sensor is in the handle of the stone and will indicate whether the stone was released before the near hog line. The lights on the stone handle will either light up green, indicating that the stone has been legally thrown, or red, in which case the illegally thrown stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.

The stone must clear the far hog line or else be removed from play (&quot;hogged&quot;); an exception is made if a stone fails to come to rest beyond the far hog line after rebounding from a stone in play just past the hog line.

=== Sweeping ===

After the stone is delivered, its trajectory is influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to make the stone travel further, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone&#x27;s path. Sweeping is able to make the stone travel further and straighter by slightly melting the ice under the brooms, thus decreasing the friction as the stone travels across that part of the ice. The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance.

One of the basic technical aspects of curling is knowing when to sweep. When the ice in front of the stone is swept, a stone will usually travel both further and straighter, and in some situations one of those is not desirable. For example, a stone may be traveling too fast (said to have too much weight), but require sweeping to prevent curling into another stone. The team must decide which is better: getting by the other stone, but traveling too far, or hitting the stone.

Much of the yelling that goes on during a curling game is the skip and sweepers exchanging information about the stone&#x27;s &quot;line&quot; and &quot;weight&quot; and deciding whether to sweep. The skip evaluates the path of the stone and calls to the sweepers to sweep as necessary to maintain the intended track. The sweepers themselves are responsible for judging the weight of the stone, ensuring that the length of travel is correct and communicating the weight of the stone back to the skip. Many teams use a &quot;number system&quot; to communicate in which of 10 zones the sweepers estimate the stone will stop. Some sweepers use stopwatches to time the stone from the back line or tee line to the nearest hog line to aid in estimating how far the stone will travel.

Usually, the two sweepers will be on opposite sides of the stone&#x27;s path, although depending on which side the sweepers&#x27; strengths lie this may not always be the case. Speed and pressure are vital to sweeping. In gripping the broom, one hand should be one third of the way from the top (non-brush end) of the handle while the other hand should be one third of the way from the head of the broom. The angle of the broom to the ice should be such that the most force possible can be exerted on the ice. The precise amount of pressure may vary from relatively light brushing (&quot;just cleaning&quot; - to ensure debris will not alter the stone&#x27;s path) to maximum-pressure scrubbing.

Sweeping is allowed anywhere on the ice up to the &quot;tee line&quot;; once the leading edge of a stone crosses the tee line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, if a stone is behind the tee line one player from the opposing team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip, but if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.

=== &quot;Burning&quot; a stone ===
Occasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part. This is often referred to as &quot;burning&quot; a stone. Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of good sportsmanship. Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction as long as the stone is struck in such a manner that its position is not altered, and this is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.

When a stone is touched when stones are in play, the remedies vary between leaving the stones as they end up after the touch, replacing the stones as they would have been if no stone were touched, or removal of the touched stone from play. In non-officiated league play, the skip of the non-offending team has the final say on where the stones are placed after the infraction.

=== Types of shots ===

Many different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:

&quot;Guards&quot; are thrown in front of the house in the &quot;free guard zone&quot;, usually to protect a stone or to make the opposing team&#x27;s shot difficult. Guard shots include the &quot;centre-guard&quot;, on the centreline, and the &quot;corner-guards&quot; to the left or right sides of the centre line. See &quot;Free Guard Zone&quot; below.

&quot;Draws&quot; are thrown only to reach the house. Draw shots include &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;come-around&quot;, and &quot;freeze&quot; shots.

&quot;Takeouts&quot; are intended to remove stones from play and include the &quot;peel&quot;, &quot;hit-and-roll&quot;, and &quot;double&quot; shots.

For a more complete listing, see Glossary of curling terms.

=== Free guard zone ===

The &quot;free guard zone&quot; is the area of the curling sheet between the hog line and tee line, excluding the house. Until five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer and two from the side with hammer), stones in the free guard zone may not be removed by an opponent&#x27;s stone, although they can be moved within the playing area. If a stone in the free guard zone is knocked out of play, it is placed back in the position it was in before the shot was thrown and the opponent&#x27;s stone is removed from play. This rule is known as the &quot;five-rock rule&quot; or the &quot;free guard zone rule&quot; (previous versions of the free guard zone rule only limited removing guards from play in the first three or four rocks).

This rule, a relatively recent addition to curling, was added in response to a strategy by teams of gaining a lead in the game and then &quot;peeling&quot; all of the opponents&#x27; stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter&#x27;s stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). By knocking all stones out the opponents could at best score one point, if they had the last stone of the end (called the hammer). If the team peeling the rocks had the hammer they could peel rock after rock which would &quot;blank the end&quot; (leave the end scoreless), keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as ice-makers had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and newer brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. Observers at the time noted that if two teams equally skilled in the peel game faced each other on good ice, the outcome of the game would be predictable from who won the coin flip to have last rock (or had earned it in the schedule) at the beginning of the game. The 1990 Brier (Canadian men&#x27;s championship) was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the amount of peeling and the quick adoption of the free guard zone rule the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.

The free guard zone rule was originally called the Modified Moncton Rule and was developed from a suggestion made by Russ Howard for the Moncton 100 cashspiel in Moncton, New Brunswick, in January 1990. &quot;Howard&#x27;s Rule&quot; (later known as the Moncton Rule), used for the tournament and based on a practice drill his team used, had the first four rocks in play unable to be removed no matter where they were at any time during the end. This method of play was altered by restricting the area in which a stone was protected to the free guard zone only for the first four rocks thrown and adopted as a four-rock free guard zone rule for international competition shortly after. Canada kept to the traditional rules until a three-rock free guard zone rule was adopted for the 1993–94 season. After several years of having the three-rock rule used for the Canadian championships and the winners then having to adjust to the four-rock rule in the World Championships, the Canadian Curling Association adopted the four-rock free guard zone in the 2002–03 season.

One strategy that has been developed by curlers in response to the free guard zone (Kevin Martin from Alberta is one of the best examples) is the &quot;tick&quot; game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use, but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard, but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in it being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in it still being tactically useful for the opposition. There is also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. Steve Gould from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face of the guard stone. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.

With the tick shot reducing the effectiveness of the four-rock rule, the Grand Slam of Curling series of bonspiels adopted a five-rock rule in 2014. In 2017, the five-rock rule was adopted by the World Curling Federation and member organizations for official play, beginning in the 2018–19 season.

=== Hammer === 
The last rock in an end is called the &quot;hammer&quot;, and throwing the hammer gives a team a tactical advantage. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a &quot;draw-to-the-button&quot; contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team&#x27;s win–loss record. In all subsequent ends, the team that did not score in the preceding end gets to throw second, thus having the hammer. In the event that neither team scores, called a &quot;blanked end&quot;, the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip may try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer the next end, giving the team another chance to use the hammer advantage to try to score two points. Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as &quot;stealing&quot;, or &quot;a steal&quot;, and is much more difficult.

=== Strategy ===
Curling is a game of strategy, tactics, and skill. The strategy depends on the team&#x27;s skill, the opponent&#x27;s skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the &quot;hammer&quot;). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and although risky the rewards can be great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.

If a team does not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try to clog up the four-foot zone in the house to deny the opposing team access to the button. This can be done by throwing &quot;centre line&quot; guards in front of the house on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a &quot;corner guard&quot; as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house, but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team&#x27;s shot to remove it more difficult.

Ideally, the strategy in an end for a team with the hammer is to score two points or more. Scoring one point is often a wasted opportunity, as they will then lose last-stone advantage for the next end. If a team cannot score two points, they will often attempt to &quot;blank an end&quot; by removing any leftover opposition stones and rolling out; or, if there are no opposition stones, just throwing the stone through the house so that no team scores any points, and the team with the hammer can try again the next end to score two or more with it. Generally, a team without the hammer would want to either force the team with the hammer to only one point, so that they can get the hammer back, or &quot;steal&quot; the end by scoring one or more points of their own.

Large leads are often defended by displacing the opponent&#x27;s stones to reduce their opportunity to score multiple points. However, a comfortably leading team that leaves their own stones in play becomes vulnerable as the opponent can draw around guard stones, stones in the house can be &quot;tapped back&quot; if they are in front of the tee line, or &quot;frozen onto&quot; if they are behind the tee line. A frozen stone is placed in front of and touching the opponent&#x27;s stone and is difficult to remove. At this point, a team may opt for &quot;peels&quot;; throws with a lot of &quot;weight&quot; that can move opposition stones out of play.

=== Conceding a game ===
It is common at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Competitive games end once the losing team has &quot;run out of rocks&quot;—that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.

=== Dispute resolution ===
Most decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip. No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined. In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button. An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button. When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.

== Scoring ==

The winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent&#x27;s closest stone.

Only stones that are &quot;in the house&quot; are considered in the scoring. A stone is in the house if it lies within the zone or any portion of its edge lies over the edge of the ring. Since the bottom of the stone is rounded, a stone just barely in the house will not have any actual contact with the ring, which will pass under the rounded edge of the stone, but it still counts. This type of stone is known as a &quot;biter&quot;.

It may not be obvious to the eye which of the two rocks is closer to the button (centre) or if a rock is actually biting or not. There are specialized devices to make these determinations, but these cannot be brought out until after an end is completed. Therefore, a team may make strategic decisions during an end based on assumptions of rock position that turn out to be incorrect.

The score is marked on a scoreboard, of which there are two types; the baseball type and the club scoreboard.

&quot;The baseball-style scoreboard&quot; was created for televised games for audiences not familiar with the club scoreboard. The &quot;ends&quot; are marked by columns 1 through to the regulation number of ends for the competition (usually with an extra column to account for the possibility of an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team&#x27;s score for that end and their total score in the right-hand column.

&quot;The club scoreboard&quot; is traditional and used in most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only requires the use of (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like &quot;1&quot; and especially &quot;0&quot;) may be needed. The numbered centre row represents various possible scores, and the numbers placed in the team rows represent the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a &quot;three-ender&quot;), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a &quot;blank end&quot;. The blank end numbers are usually listed in the furthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the &quot;hammer&quot; (last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.

The following example illustrates the difference between the two types. The example illustrates the men&#x27;s final at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Eight points – all the rocks thrown by one team counting – is the highest score possible in an end, and is known as an &quot;eight-ender&quot; or &quot;snowman&quot;. Scoring an eight-ender is very difficult; in curling, it is the equivalent of pitching a perfect game in baseball. Probably the best-known snowman came at the 2006 Players&#x27; Championships. Future (2007) World Champion Kelly Scott scored eight points in one of her games against 1998 World bronze medalist Cathy King.

== Culture ==


Competition teams are normally named after the skip, for example, Team Martin after skip Kevin Martin. Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.

Top curling championships are typically played by all-male or all-female teams. It is known as mixed curling when a team consists of two men and two women. For many years, in the absence of world championship or Olympic mixed curling events, national championships (of which the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship was the most prominent) were the highest-level mixed curling competitions. However, a European Mixed Curling Championship was inaugurated in 2005, a World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship was established in 2008, and the European Mixed Championship was replaced with the World Mixed Curling Championship in 2015. A mixed tournament was held at the Olympic level for the first time in 2018, although it was a doubles tournament, not a four-person.

Curling tournaments may use the Schenkel system for determining the participants in matches.

Curling is played in many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom (especially Scotland), the United States, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, and Japan, all of which compete in the world championships.

Curling has been depicted by many artists including: George Harvey, John Levack, The Dutch School, Charles Martin Hardie, John Elliot Maguire, John McGhie, and John George Brown.

Curling is particularly popular in Canada. Improvements in ice making and changes in the rules to increase scoring and promote complex strategy have increased the already high popularity of the sport in Canada, and large television audiences watch annual curling telecasts, especially the Scotties Tournament of Hearts (the national championship for women), the Montana&#x27;s Brier (the national championship for men), and the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s world championships.

Despite the Canadian province of Manitoba&#x27;s small population (ranked 5th of 10 Canadian provinces), Manitoban teams have won the Brier more times than teams from any other province, except for Alberta. The Tournament of Hearts and the Brier are contested by provincial and territorial champions, and the world championships by national champions.

Curling is the provincial sport of Saskatchewan. From there, Ernie Richardson and his family team dominated Canadian and international curling during the late 1950s and early 1960s and have been considered to be the best male curlers of all time. Sandra Schmirler led her team to the first-ever gold medal in women&#x27;s curling in the 1998 Winter Olympics. When she died two years later from cancer, over 15,000 people attended her funeral, and it was broadcast on national television.

=== Good sportsmanship ===
More so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Curling&quot;, is an integral part of curling. The Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping, or spectacular form. Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses, or gaffes by one&#x27;s opponent (unlike most team sports), and one should not celebrate one&#x27;s own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump, or thumbs-up gesture. Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match. On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship. It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction, or heckling.

A match traditionally begins with players shaking hands with and saying &quot;good curling&quot; or &quot;have a pleasant game&quot; to each member of the opposing team. It is also traditional in some areas for the winning team to buy the losing team a drink after the game. Even at the highest levels of play, players are expected to call their own fouls.

It is not uncommon for a team to concede a curling match after it believes it no longer has any hope of winning. Concession is an honourable act and does not carry the stigma associated with quitting. It also allows for more socializing. To concede a match, members of the losing team offer congratulatory handshakes to the winning team. Thanks, wishes of future good luck, and hugs are usually exchanged between the teams. To continue playing when a team has no realistic chance of winning can be seen as a breach of etiquette.

=== Accessibility ===
Curling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack. These curlers may use a device known as a &quot;delivery stick&quot;. The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler. At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone. The Canadian Curling Association &quot;Rules of Curling&quot; allows the use of a delivery stick in club play, but does not permit it in championships.

The delivery stick was specifically invented for elderly curlers in Canada in 1999. In early 2016 an international initiative started to allow use of the delivery sticks by players over 60 years of age in World Curling Federation Senior Championships, as well as in any projected Masters (60+) Championship that develops in the future.

==Floor curling==
An iceless variation of the sport called &quot;floor curling&quot; was developed by Hong Konger John Li Shek-chong in 2014. Floor curling is governed by the World FloorCurling Federation which was also set up by Li.
== Terminology ==
Terms used to describe the game include:

The ice in the game may be &quot;fast (keen)&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;. If the ice is keen, a rock will travel further with a given amount of weight (throwing force) on it. The speed of the ice is measured in seconds. One such measure, known as &quot;hog-to-hog&quot; time, is the speed of the stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line until it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed can also be used to measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 13 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 8 seconds for peel weight.

&quot;The back line to hog line speed&quot; is used principally by sweepers to get an initial sense of the weight of a stone. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 4.0 seconds for guards, 3.8 seconds for draws, 3.2 for normal hit weight, and 2.9 seconds for peel weight. Especially at the club level, this metric can be misleading, due to amateurs sometimes pushing stones on release, causing the stone to travel faster than the back-to-hog speed.
