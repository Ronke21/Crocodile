<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to engineering:

[[Engineering]] is the scientific discipline and profession that applies scientific theories, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to design, create, and analyze technological solutions cognizant of safety, human factors, physical laws, regulations, practicality, and cost.

== Branches of engineering ==
* Applied engineering – application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization.
**Packaging engineering
* Biological engineering
** Agricultural engineering

<text>The following outline provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

[[Entertainment]] is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to amuse themselves in their leisure time, and may also provide fun, enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play sport as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The [[Show business|entertainment industry]] (informally known as [[show business]] or show biz) is part of the tertiary sector of the economy and includes many sub-industries devoted to entertainment. However, the term is often used in the mass media to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term &quot;show biz&quot; in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially musical theatre, vaudeville, comedy, film, fun, and music. It applies to every aspect of entertainment including cinema, television, radio, theatre, and music.

<text>The following is a list of contemporary ethnic groups. There has been constant debate over the classification of ethnic groups. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be associated with shared ancestry, history, homeland, language or dialect and cultural heritage; where the term &quot;culture&quot; specifically includes aspects such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing (clothing) style and other factors.

By the nature of the concept, ethnic groups tend to be divided into subgroups, may themselves be or not be identified as independent ethnic groups depending on the source consulted.

==Ethnic groups==
The following groups are commonly identified as &quot;ethnic groups&quot;, as opposed to ethno-linguistic phyla, national groups, racial groups or similar.

<text>&quot;Edda&quot; (; Old Norse &quot;Edda&quot;, plural &quot;Eddur&quot;) is an Old Norse term that has been applied by modern scholars to the collective of two Medieval Icelandic literary works: what is now known as the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and an older collection of poems (without an original title) now known as the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The term historically referred only to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, but this usage has fallen out of favour because of confusion with the other work. Both works were recorded in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching back into the Viking Age. The books provide the main sources for medieval skaldic tradition in Iceland and for Norse mythology.

==Etymology==
At least five hypotheses have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;edda&quot;:

* One hypothesis holds that it is identical to a word that means &quot;great-grandmother&quot; appearing in the Eddic poem &quot;Rígsþula.&quot; 
* Another hypothesis holds that &quot;edda&quot; derives from Old Norse &quot;óðr&quot;, &quot;poetry&quot;.
* A third, proposed in 1895 by Eiríkr Magnússon, is that it derives from the Icelandic place name &quot;Oddi&quot;, site of the church and school where students, including Snorri Sturluson, were educated.
* A fourth hypothesis—the derivation of the word &quot;Edda&quot; as the name of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s treatise on poetry from the Latin &quot;edo&quot;, &quot;I compose (poetry)&quot;, by analogy with &quot;kredda&quot;, &quot;superstition&quot;, from Latin &quot;credo&quot;, &quot;creed&quot;—is now widely accepted, although this acceptance might stem from its agreement with modern usage rather than historical accuracy.
* The fifth hypothesis is based on the past fashion of giving Icelandic manuscripts bird titles. Such are the legal codes &quot;Grágás&quot; &#x27;grey goose&#x27;, &quot;Gullfjǫðr&quot; &#x27;gold feather (quill?)&#x27;, and &quot;Hryggjar-stykki&quot; &#x27;a kind of duck&#x27;. Perhaps &quot;Edda&quot; was also one of such titles: &quot;Edda&quot; would be an appropriate &#x27;pet name&#x27; of &quot;æðr&quot; (pronounced as [æ:ðr] f.) &#x27;eider duck&#x27;. Then, &quot;Edda&quot; meant &#x27;little eider duck&#x27; (an analog of &quot;Grágás&quot;).

==The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;==


The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, also known as &quot;Sæmundar Edda&quot; or the &quot;Elder Edda&quot;, is a collection of Old Norse poems from the Icelandic medieval manuscript Codex Regius (&quot;Royal Book&quot;). Along with the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; is the most expansive source on Norse mythology. The first part of the Codex Regius preserves poems that narrate the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Old Norse mythological world as well as individual myths about gods concerning Norse deities. The poems in the second part narrate legends about Norse heroes and heroines, such as Sigurd, Brynhildr and Gunnar.

It consists of two parts. The first part has 10 songs about gods, and the second one has 19 songs about heroes.

The Codex Regius was written in the 13th century, but nothing is known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynjólfur Sveinsson, then the Church of Iceland&#x27;s Bishop of Skálholt. At that time, versions of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; were well known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another &quot;Edda&quot;—an &quot;Elder Edda&quot;—which contained the pagan poems Snorri quotes in his book. When the Codex Regius was discovered, it seemed that this speculation had proven correct. Brynjólfur attributed the manuscript to Sæmundr the Learned, a larger-than-life 12th century Icelandic priest. While this attribution is rejected by modern scholars, the name &quot;Sæmundar Edda&quot; is still sometimes encountered.

Bishop Brynjólfur sent the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; as a present to King Christian IV of Denmark, hence the name &quot;Codex Regius&quot;. For centuries it was stored in the Royal Library in Copenhagen but in 1971 it was returned to Iceland.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Younger Edda&quot; or &quot;Snorri&#x27;s Edda&quot;, is an Icelandic manual of poetics which also contains many mythological stories. Its purpose was to enable Icelandic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of alliterative verse, and to grasp the mythological allusions behind the many kennings that were used in skaldic poetry.

It was written by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around 1220. It survives in four known manuscripts and three fragments, written down from about 1300 to about 1600.

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; consists of a Prologue and three separate books: &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, concerning the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Norse mythical world; &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a dialogue between Ægir, a Norse god connected with the sea, and Bragi, the skaldic god of poetry; and &quot;Háttatal&quot;, a demonstration of verse forms used in Norse mythology.

<text>The term ephemeris time (often abbreviated ET) can in principle refer to time in association with any ephemeris (itinerary of the trajectory of an astronomical object). In practice it has been used more specifically to refer to:

# a former standard astronomical time scale adopted in 1952 by the IAU, and superseded during the 1970s. This time scale was proposed in 1948, to overcome the disadvantages of irregularly fluctuating mean solar time. The intent was to define a uniform time (as far as was then feasible) based on Newtonian theory (see below: Definition of ephemeris time (1952)). Ephemeris time was a first application of the concept of a dynamical time scale, in which the time and time scale are defined implicitly, inferred from the observed position of an astronomical object via the dynamical theory of its motion.
# a modern relativistic coordinate time scale, implemented by the JPL ephemeris time argument Teph, in a series of numerically integrated Development Ephemerides. Among them is the DE405 ephemeris in widespread current use. The time scale represented by Teph is closely related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate) from, the TCB time scale currently adopted as a standard by the IAU (see below: JPL ephemeris time argument Teph).

Most of the following sections relate to the ephemeris time of the 1952 standard.

An impression has sometimes arisen that ephemeris time was in use from 1900: this probably arose because ET, though proposed and adopted in the period 1948–1952, was defined in detail using formulae that made retrospective use of the epoch date of 1900 January 0 and of Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot;.

The ephemeris time of the 1952 standard leaves a continuing legacy, through its historical unit ephemeris second which became closely duplicated in the length of the current standard SI second (see below: Redefinition of the second).

==History (1952 standard)==
Ephemeris time (ET), adopted as standard in 1952, was originally designed as an approach to a uniform time scale, to be freed from the effects of irregularity in the rotation of the Earth, &quot;for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists&quot;, for example for use in ephemerides of the Sun (as observed from the Earth), the Moon, and the planets. It was proposed in 1948 by G M Clemence.

From the time of John Flamsteed (1646–1719) it had been believed that the Earth&#x27;s daily rotation was uniform. But in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with increasing precision of astronomical measurements, it began to be suspected, and was eventually established, that the rotation of the Earth (&quot;i.e.&quot; the length of the day) showed irregularities on short time scales, and was slowing down on longer time scales. The evidence was compiled by W de Sitter (1927) who wrote &quot;If we accept this hypothesis, then the &#x27;astronomical time&#x27;, given by the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and used in all practical astronomical computations, differs from the &#x27;uniform&#x27; or &#x27;Newtonian&#x27; time, which is defined as the independent variable of the equations of celestial mechanics&quot;. De Sitter offered a correction to be applied to the mean solar time given by the Earth&#x27;s rotation to get uniform time.

Other astronomers of the period also made suggestions for obtaining uniform time, including A Danjon (1929), who suggested in effect that observed positions of the Moon, Sun and planets, when compared with their well-established gravitational ephemerides, could better and more uniformly define and determine time.

Thus the aim developed, to provide a new time scale for astronomical and scientific purposes, to avoid the unpredictable irregularities of the mean solar time scale, and to replace for these purposes Universal Time (UT) and any other time scale based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis, such as sidereal time.

The American astronomer G M Clemence (1948) made a detailed proposal of this type based on the results of the English Astronomer Royal H Spencer Jones (1939). Clemence (1948) made it clear that his proposal was intended &quot;for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists only&quot; and that it was &quot;logical to continue the use of mean solar time for civil purposes&quot;.

De Sitter and Clemence both referred to the proposal as &#x27;Newtonian&#x27; or &#x27;uniform&#x27; time. D Brouwer suggested the name &#x27;ephemeris time&#x27;.

Following this, an astronomical conference held in Paris in 1950 recommended &quot;that in all cases where the mean solar second is unsatisfactory as a unit of time by reason of its variability, the unit adopted should be the sidereal year at 1900.0, that the time reckoned in this unit be designated &quot;ephemeris time&quot;&quot;, and gave Clemence&#x27;s formula (see Definition of ephemeris time (1952)) for translating mean solar time to ephemeris time.

The International Astronomical Union approved this recommendation at its 1952 general assembly. Practical introduction took some time (see Use of ephemeris time in official almanacs and ephemerides); ephemeris time (ET) remained a standard until superseded in the 1970s by further time scales (see Revision).

During the currency of ephemeris time as a standard, the details were revised a little. The unit was redefined in terms of the tropical year at 1900.0 instead of the sidereal year; and the standard second was defined first as 1/31556925.975 of the tropical year at 1900.0, and then as the slightly modified fraction 1/31556925.9747 instead, finally being redefined in 1967/8 in terms of the cesium atomic clock standard (see below).

Although ET is no longer directly in use, it leaves a continuing legacy. Its successor time scales, such as TDT, as well as the atomic time scale IAT (TAI), were designed with a relationship that &quot;provides continuity with ephemeris time&quot;. ET was used for the calibration of atomic clocks in the 1950s. Close equality between the ET second with the later SI second (as defined with reference to the cesium atomic clock) has been verified to within 1 part in 1010.

In this way, decisions made by the original designers of ephemeris time influenced the length of today&#x27;s standard SI second, and in turn, this has a continuing influence on the number of leap seconds which have been needed for insertion into current broadcast time scales, to keep them approximately in step with mean solar time.

==Definition (1952)==
Ephemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun (but its practical implementation was usually achieved in another way, see below). Its detailed definition was based on Simon Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot; (1895), implemented in a new way to accommodate certain observed discrepancies:

In the introduction to &quot;Tables of the Sun,&quot; the basis of the tables (p. 9) includes a formula for the Sun&#x27;s mean longitude at a time, indicated by interval T (in units of Julian centuries of 36525 mean solar days), reckoned from Greenwich Mean Noon on 0 January 1900:

: Ls = 279° 41&#x27; 48&quot;.04 + 129,602,768&quot;.13T +1&quot;.089T2 . . . . . (1)

Spencer Jones&#x27; work of 1939 showed that differences between the observed positions of the Sun and the predicted positions given by Newcomb&#x27;s formula demonstrated the need for the following correction to the formula:

: ΔLs = + 1&quot;.00 + 2&quot;.97T + 1&quot;.23T2 + 0.0748B

where &quot;the times of observation are in Universal time, not corrected to Newtonian time,&quot; and 0.0748B represents an irregular fluctuation calculated from lunar observations.

Thus, a conventionally corrected form of Newcomb&#x27;s formula, incorporating the corrections on the basis of mean solar time, would be the sum of the two preceding expressions:

: Ls = 279° 41&#x27; 49&quot;.04 + 129,602,771&quot;.10T +2&quot;.32T2 +0.0748B . . . . . (2)

Clemence&#x27;s 1948 proposal, however, did not adopt such a correction of mean solar time. Instead, the same numbers were used as in Newcomb&#x27;s original uncorrected formula (1), but now applied somewhat prescriptively, to define a new time and time scale implicitly, based on the real position of the Sun:

: Ls = 279° 41&#x27; 48&quot;.04 + 129,602,768&quot;.13E +1&quot;.089E2 . . . . . (3)

With this reapplication, the time variable, now given as E, represents time in ephemeris centuries of 36525 ephemeris days of 86400 ephemeris seconds each. The 1961 official reference summarized the concept as such: &quot;The origin and rate of ephemeris time are defined to make the Sun&#x27;s mean longitude agree with Newcomb&#x27;s expression&quot;

From the comparison of formulae (2) and (3), both of which express the same real solar motion in the same real time but defined on separate time scales, Clemence arrived at an explicit expression, estimating the difference in seconds of time between ephemeris time and mean solar time, in the sense (ET-UT):

formula_1 . . . . . (4)

with the 24.349 seconds of time corresponding to the 1.00&quot; in ΔLs.
Clemence&#x27;s formula (today superseded by more modern estimations) was included in the original conference decision on ephemeris time. In view of the fluctuation term, practical determination of the difference between ephemeris time and UT depended on observation. Inspection of the formulae above shows that the (ideally constant) units of ephemeris time have been, for the whole of the twentieth century, very slightly shorter than the corresponding (but not precisely constant) units of mean solar time (which, besides their irregular fluctuations, tend to lengthen gradually). This finding is consistent with the modern results of Morrison and Stephenson (see article ΔT).

==Implementations==

===Secondary realizations by lunar observations===
Although ephemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun, it was usually measured in practice by the orbital motion of the Moon around the Earth. These measurements can be considered as secondary realizations (in a metrological sense) of the primary definition of ET in terms of the solar motion, after a calibration of the mean motion of the Moon with respect to the mean motion of the Sun.

Reasons for the use of lunar measurements were practically based: the Moon moves against the background of stars about 13 times as fast as the Sun&#x27;s corresponding rate of motion, and the accuracy of time determinations from lunar measurements is correspondingly greater.

When ephemeris time was first adopted, time scales were still based on astronomical observation, as they always had been. The accuracy was limited by the accuracy of optical observation, and corrections of clocks and time signals were published in arrear.

===Secondary realizations by atomic clocks===
A few years later, with the invention of the cesium atomic clock, an alternative offered itself. Increasingly, after the calibration in 1958 of the cesium atomic clock by reference to ephemeris time, cesium atomic clocks running on the basis of ephemeris seconds began to be used and kept in step with ephemeris time. The atomic clocks offered a further secondary realization of ET, on a quasi-real time basis that soon proved to be more useful than the primary ET standard: not only more convenient, but also more precisely uniform than the primary standard itself. Such secondary realizations were used and described as &#x27;ET&#x27;, with an awareness that the time scales based on the atomic clocks were not identical to that defined by the primary ephemeris time standard, but rather, an improvement over it on account of their closer approximation to uniformity. The atomic clocks gave rise to the atomic time scale, and to what was first called Terrestrial Dynamical Time and is now Terrestrial Time, defined to provide continuity with ET.

The availability of atomic clocks, together with the increasing accuracy of astronomical observations (which meant that relativistic corrections were at least in the foreseeable future no longer going to be small enough to be neglected), led to the eventual replacement of the ephemeris time standard by more refined time scales including terrestrial time and barycentric dynamical time, to which ET can be seen as an approximation.

==Revision of time scales==
In 1976, the IAU resolved that the theoretical basis for its then-current (since 1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time would be replaced by two relativistic timescales intended to constitute dynamical timescales: Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) and Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). Difficulties were recognized, which led to these, in turn, being superseded in the 1990s by time scales Terrestrial Time (TT), Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT (TCG) and Barycentric Coordinate Time BCT (TCB).

==JPL ephemeris time argument Teph==
High-precision ephemerides of sun, moon and planets were developed and calculated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) over a long period, and the latest available were adopted for the ephemerides in the Astronomical Almanac starting in 1984. Although not an IAU standard, the ephemeris time argument Teph has been in use at that institution since the 1960s. The time scale represented by Teph has been characterized as a relativistic coordinate time that differs from Terrestrial Time only by small periodic terms with an amplitude not exceeding 2 milliseconds of time: it is linearly related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate which is of the order of 0.5 s/a) from the TCB time scale adopted in 1991 as a standard by the IAU. Thus for clocks on or near the geoid, Teph (within 2 milliseconds), but not so closely TCB, can be used as approximations to Terrestrial Time, and via the standard ephemerides Teph is in widespread use.

Partly in acknowledgement of the widespread use of Teph via the JPL ephemerides, IAU resolution 3 of 2006 (re-)defined Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) as a current standard. As re-defined in 2006, TDB is a linear transformation of TCB. The same IAU resolution also stated (in note 4) that the &quot;independent time argument of the JPL ephemeris DE405, which is called Teph&quot; (here the IAU source cites), &quot;is for practical purposes the same as TDB defined in this Resolution&quot;. Thus the new TDB, like Teph, is essentially a more refined continuation of the older ephemeris time ET and (apart from the periodic fluctuations) has the same mean rate as that established for ET in the 1950s.

==Use in official almanacs and ephemerides==
Ephemeris time based on the standard adopted in 1952 was introduced into the Astronomical Ephemeris (UK) and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, replacing UT in the main ephemerides in the issues for 1960 and after. (But the ephemerides in the Nautical Almanac, by then a separate publication for the use of navigators, continued to be expressed in terms of UT.) The ephemerides continued on this basis through 1983 (with some changes due to adoption of improved values of astronomical constants), after which, for 1984 onwards, they adopted the JPL ephemerides.

Previous to the 1960 change, the &#x27;Improved Lunar Ephemeris&#x27; had already been made available in terms of ephemeris time for the years 1952—1959 (computed by W J Eckert from Brown&#x27;s theory with modifications recommended by Clemence (1948)).

==Redefinition of the second==
Successive definitions of the unit of ephemeris time are mentioned above (History). The value adopted for the 1956/1960 standard second:

:the fraction 1/31 556 925.9747 of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time.

was obtained from the linear time-coefficient in Newcomb&#x27;s expression for the solar mean longitude (above), taken and applied with the same meaning for the time as in formula (3) above. The relation with Newcomb&#x27;s coefficient can be seen from:

:1/31 556 925.9747 = 129 602 768.13 / (360×60×60×36 525×86 400).

Caesium atomic clocks became operational in 1955, and quickly confirmed the evidence that the rotation of the Earth fluctuated irregularly. This confirmed the unsuitability of the mean solar second of Universal Time as a measure of time interval for the most precise purposes. After three years of comparisons with lunar observations, Markowitz et al. (1958) determined that the ephemeris second corresponded to 9 192 631 770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen cesium resonance.

Following this, in 1967/68, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) replaced the definition of the SI second by the following:
The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.

Although this is an independent definition that does not refer to the older basis of ephemeris time, it uses the same quantity as the value of the ephemeris second measured by the cesium clock in 1958. This SI second referred to atomic time was later verified by Markowitz (1988) to be in agreement, within 1 part in 1010, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations.

For practical purposes the length of the ephemeris second can be taken as equal to the length of the second of Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) or Terrestrial Time (TT) or its predecessor TDT.

The difference between ET and UT is called ΔT; it changes irregularly, but the long-term trend is parabolic, decreasing from ancient times until the nineteenth century, and increasing since then at a rate corresponding to an increase in the solar day length of 1.7 ms per century (see leap seconds).

International Atomic Time (TAI) was set equal to UT2 at 1 January 1958 0:00:00. At that time, ΔT was already about 32.18 seconds. The difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) (the successor to ephemeris time) and atomic time was later defined as follows:

:1977 January 1.000 3725 TT = 1977 January 1.000 0000 TAI, &quot;i.e.&quot;

:TT − TAI = 32.184 seconds

This difference may be assumed constant—the rates of TT and TAI are designed to be identical.

<text>EastEnders is a British television soap opera created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland which has been broadcast on BBC One since February 1985. Set in the fictional borough of Walford in the East End of London, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they go about their daily lives. Within eight months of the show&#x27;s original launch, it had reached the number one spot in BARB&#x27;s television ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated series in Britain. Four &quot;EastEnders&quot; episodes are listed in the all-time top 10 most-watched programmes in the UK, including the number one spot, when over 30 million watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode. &quot;EastEnders&quot; has been important in the history of British television drama, tackling many subjects that are considered to be controversial or taboo in British culture, and portraying a social life previously unseen on UK mainstream television.

Since co-creator Holland was from a large family in the East End, a theme heavily featured in &quot;EastEnders&quot; is strong families, and each character is supposed to have their own place in the fictional community. The Watts, Beales/Fowlers, Mitchells, Brannings and the Slaters are some of the families that have been central to the soap&#x27;s notable and dramatic storylines. &quot;EastEnders&quot; has been filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre since its inception, with a set that is outdoors and open to weather. In 2014, the BBC announced plans to rebuild the set entirely. Filming commenced on the new set in January 2022, and it was first used on-screen in March 2022. Demolition on the old set commenced in November 2022.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has received both praise and criticism for many of its storylines, which have dealt with difficult themes including violence, rape, murder and abuse. It has been criticised for various storylines, including the 2010 baby swap storyline, which attracted over 6,000 complaints, as well as complaints of showing too much violence and allegations of national and racial stereotypes. However, &quot;EastEnders&quot; has also been commended for representing real-life issues and spreading awareness on social topics. The cast and crew of the show have received and been nominated for various awards.

== History ==
=== Conception and preparations for broadcast ===
In March 1983, under two years before &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea in the mind of a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what BBC One needed was a popular twice-weekly drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV were getting with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were Julia Smith and Tony Holland, a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year. After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London. It was decided after a report indicated that a show focusing on a working-class London neighbourhood would have the most widespread appeal. Granada Television gave Smith unrestricted access to the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; production for a month so that she could get a sense of how a continuing drama was produced. The show initially had the working title &quot;East 8&quot; and was, at first, to be set in a real street in Hackney, London.

Several cities were considered for the show&#x27;s setting, including Manchester and Birmingham, before ultimately choosing London. There was anxiety at first that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set in the south of England, though research commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the Midlands, as Julia Smith herself pointed out, did not mind where it was set as long as it was somewhere else. This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between &quot;EastEnders&quot; and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something of a revolution in practice.

The show&#x27;s creators were both Londoners, but when they researched Victorian squares, they found massive changes in areas they thought they knew well; however, delving further into the East End of London, they found exactly what they had been searching for: a real East End spirit, an inward-looking quality, a distrust of strangers and authority figures, a sense of territory and community that the creators summed up as &quot;Hurt one of us and you hurt us all&quot;.

When developing &quot;EastEnders&quot;, both Smith and Holland looked at influential models like &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, but they found that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after &quot;EastEnders&quot; began, and featured the characters of Tony Carpenter and Kelvin Carpenter, did &quot;Coronation Street&quot; start to feature black characters, for example. They came to the conclusion that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; had grown old with its audience, and that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would have to attract a younger, more socially extensive audience, ensuring that it had the longevity to retain it for many years thereafter. They also looked at &quot;Brookside&quot;, but found there was a lack of central meeting points for the characters, making it difficult for the writers to intertwine different storylines, so &quot;EastEnders&quot; was set in Albert Square.

A previous UK soap set in an East End market was ATV&#x27;s &quot;Market in Honey Lane&quot;; however, between 1967 and 1969, this show, which graduated from one showing a week to two in three separate series (the latter series being shown in different time slots across the ITV network) was very different in style and approach from &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The British Film Institute described &quot;Market in Honey Lane&quot; thus: &quot;It was not an earth-shaking programme, and certainly not pioneering in any revolutionary ideas in technique and production, but simply proposed itself to the casual viewer as a mildly pleasant affair.&quot;

The target launch date was originally January 1985. Smith and Holland had 11 months in which to write, cast and shoot the whole thing; however, in February 1984, they did not even have a title or a place to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree studios operational, January was the most realistic date; however, this was later to be changed to February.

The project had a number of working titles: &quot;Square Dance&quot;, &quot;Round the Square&quot;, &quot;Round the Houses&quot;, &quot;London Pride&quot; and &quot;East 8&quot;. It was the latter that stuck (E8 is the postcode for Hackney) in the early months of creative process; however, the show was renamed after many casting agents mistakenly thought the show was to be called &quot;Estate&quot;, and the fictional postcode E20 was created, instead of using E8. Julia Smith came up with the name &quot;Eastenders&quot; after she and Holland had spent months telephoning theatrical agents and asking &quot;Do you have any real East Enders on your books?&quot; Smith thought &quot;Eastenders&quot; &quot;looked ugly written down&quot; and was &quot;hard to say&quot;, so decided to capitalise the second &quot;e&quot;.

==== Initial character creation and casting ====

After they decided on the filming location of BBC Elstree Centre in south Hertfordshire, Smith and Holland set about creating the 23 characters needed, in just 14 days. They took a holiday in Playa de los Pocillos, Lanzarote, and started to devise the characters. Holland created the Beale and Fowler family, drawing on his own background. His mother, Ethel Holland, was one of four sisters raised in Walthamstow. Her eldest sister, Lou, had married a man named Albert Beale and had two children, named Peter and Pauline. These family members were the basis for Lou Beale, Pete Beale and Pauline Fowler. Holland also created Pauline&#x27;s unemployed husband Arthur Fowler, their children Mark and Michelle, Pete&#x27;s wife Kathy and their son Ian. Smith used her personal memories of East End residents she met when researching Victorian squares. Ethel Skinner was based on an old woman she met in a pub, with ill-fitting false teeth, and a &quot;face to rival a neon sign&quot;, holding a Yorkshire Terrier in one hand and a pint of Guinness in the other.

Other characters created included Jewish doctor Harold Legg, the Anglo-Cypriot Osman family (Ali, Sue and baby Hassan), black father and son Tony and Kelvin Carpenter, single mother Mary Smith and Bangladeshi couple Saeed and Naima Jeffery. Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring &quot;flash, trash, and melodrama&quot; to the Square (they were later renamed Den, Angie and Sharon). The characters of Andy O&#x27;Brien and Debbie Wilkins were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and Lofty Holloway to show an outsider; someone who did not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland&#x27;s personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.

Once they had decided on their 23 characters, they returned to London for a meeting with the BBC. Everyone agreed that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp—set in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain—and it would start with a bang (namely the death of Reg Cox). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, Nick Cotton was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray. When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors, which also involved the input of lead director Matthew Robinson, who supervised auditions with the other directors at the outset, Vivienne Cozens and Peter Edwards.

==== Final preparations ====

Through the next few months, the set was growing rapidly at Elstree, and a composer and designer had been commissioned to create the title sequence. Simon May wrote the theme music and Alan Jeapes created the visuals. The visual images were taken from an aircraft flying over the East End of London at 1000 feet. Approximately 800 photographs were taken and pieced together to create one big image. The credits were later updated when the Millennium Dome was built.

The launch was delayed until February 1985 due to a delay in the chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;, that was to be a part of the major revamp in BBC1&#x27;s schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as &quot;EastEnders&quot; no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal following before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (which was launching its own market-based soap, &quot;Albion Market&quot;) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7p.m. on 19 February 1985. Neither Holland nor Smith could watch; they both instead returned to the place where it all began, Albertine&#x27;s Wine Bar on Wood Lane. The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17million. The reviews were largely favourable, although, after three weeks on air, BBC1&#x27;s early evening share had returned to the pre-&quot;EastEnders&quot; figure of seven million, though &quot;EastEnders&quot; then climbed to highs of up to 23million later on in the year. Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes.

Press coverage of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, which was already intense, went into overdrive once the show was broadcast. With public interest so high, the media began investigating the private lives of the show&#x27;s popular stars. Within days, a scandalous headline appeared – &quot;EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER&quot;. This referred to Leslie Grantham, and his prison sentence for the murder of a taxi driver in an attempted robbery nearly 20 years earlier. This shocking tell-all style set the tone for relations between Albert Square and the press for the next 20 years.

The show&#x27;s first episode attracted some 17million viewers, and it continued to attract high viewing figures from then on. By Christmas 1985, the tabloids could not get enough of the soap. &quot;Exclusives&quot; about &quot;EastEnders&quot; storylines and the actors on the show became a staple of tabloid buyers&#x27; daily reading.

In 1987, the show featured the first same-sex kiss on a British soap, when Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) kissed boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the forehead. This was followed, in January 1989, by the first on-the-mouth gay kiss in a British soap when Colin kissed a new character, Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan), in an episode that was watched by 17 million people.

Writer Colin Brake suggested that 1989 was a year of big change for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer Keith Harris left the show, and Holland and Smith both decided that the time had come to move on too, their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; most successful characters, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Producer Mike Gibbon was given the task of running the show, and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale.

According to Brake, the departure of two of the soap&#x27;s most popular characters, Den and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled. In addition, several other long-running characters left the show that year, including Sue and Ali Osman (Sandy Ratcliff and Nejdet Salih) and their family; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob) and Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). Brake indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, &quot;it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start&quot;.

By the end of 1989, &quot;EastEnders&quot; had acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who had previously been a successful producer on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Bill&quot;. Brake suggested that Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the previous year.

=== Changes in the 1990s ===
A new era began in 1990, with the introduction of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp)—the Mitchell brothers—successful characters who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter. As the new production team cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, all of the characters introduced under Gibbon were axed from the show at the start of the year. Ferguson introduced other characters and was responsible for storylines including HIV, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and murder. After a successful revamp of the soap, Ferguson decided to leave &quot;EastEnders&quot; in July 1991. Ferguson was succeeded by both Leonard Lewis and Helen Greaves, who initially shared the role as executive producer. Lewis and Greaves formulated a new regime for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, giving the writers of the serial more authority in storyline progression, with the script department providing &quot;guidance rather than prescriptive episode storylines&quot;. By the end of 1992, Greaves had left, and Lewis became executive and series producer. He left &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1994 after the BBC controllers demanded an extra episode a week, taking its weekly airtime from 60 to 90 minutes. Lewis felt that producing an hour of &quot;reasonable quality drama&quot; a week was the maximum that any broadcasting system could generate without loss of integrity. Having set up the transition to the new schedule, the first trio of episodes—dubbed The Vic siege—marked Lewis&#x27;s departure from the programme. Barbara Emile then became the executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, remaining with &quot;EastEnders&quot; until early 1995. She was succeeded by Corinne Hollingworth.

Hollingworth&#x27;s contributions to the soap were awarded in 1997 when &quot;EastEnders&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Drama Series. Hollingworth shared the award with the next executive producer, Jane Harris. Harris was responsible for the critically panned Ireland episodes and Cindy Beale&#x27;s (Michelle Collins) attempted assassination of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), which brought in an audience of 23 million in 1996, roughly four million more than &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In 1998 Matthew Robinson was appointed as the executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. During his reign, &quot;EastEnders&quot; won the BAFTA for &quot;Best Soap&quot; in consecutive years 1999 and 2000 and many other awards. Robinson also earned tabloid soubriquet &quot;Axeman of Albert Square&quot; after sacking a large number of characters in one hit, and several more thereafter. In their place, Robinson introduced new long-running characters including Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite), Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder), Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick).

=== 2000s ===
John Yorke became the executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2000. Yorke was given the task of introducing the soap&#x27;s fourth weekly episode. He axed the majority of the Di Marco family, except Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco), and helped introduce popular characters such as the Slater family. As what Mal Young described as &quot;two of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; most successful years&quot;, Yorke was responsible for highly rated storylines such as &quot;Who Shot Phil?&quot;, Ethel Skinner&#x27;s (Gretchen Franklin) death, Jim Branning (John Bardon) and Dot Cotton&#x27;s (June Brown) marriage, Trevor Morgan&#x27;s (Alex Ferns) domestic abuse of his wife Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth), and Kat Slater&#x27;s (Jessie Wallace) revelation to her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) that she was her mother.

In 2002, Louise Berridge succeeded Yorke as the executive producer. During her time at &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Berridge introduced popular characters such as Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and the critically panned Indian Ferreira family.

Berridge was responsible for some ratings success stories, such as Alfie and Kat Slater&#x27;s (Jessie Wallace) relationship, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) getting her comeuppance, Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns) and Jamie Mitchell&#x27;s (Jack Ryder) death storylines and the return of one of the greatest soap icons, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who had been presumed dead for 14 years. His return in late 2003 was watched by over 16 million viewers, putting &quot;EastEnders&quot; back at number one in the rating war with the &quot;Coronation Street&quot;; however, other storylines, such as one about a kidney transplant involving the Ferreiras, were not well received, and although Den&#x27;s return proved to be a ratings success, the British press branded the plot unrealistic and felt that it questioned the show&#x27;s credibility. A severe press backlash followed after Den&#x27;s actor, Leslie Grantham, was outed in an internet sex scandal, which coincided with a swift decline in viewer ratings. The scandal led to Grantham&#x27;s departure from the soap, but the occasion was used to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, with an episode showing Den&#x27;s murder at the Queen Vic pub.

On 21 September 2004, Berridge quit as executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot; following continued criticism of the show. Kathleen Hutchison was swiftly appointed in her place, and was tasked with quickly turning the fortunes of the soap. During her time at the soap Hutchison axed multiple characters and reportedly ordered the rewriting of numerous scripts. Newspapers reported on employee dissatisfaction with Hutchison&#x27;s tenure at &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In January 2005, Hutchison left the soap and John Yorke (who by this time, was the BBC controller of continuing drama series) took total control of the show himself and became acting executive producer for a short period, before appointing Kate Harwood to the role. Harwood stayed at &quot;EastEnders&quot; for 20 months before being promoted by the BBC. The highly anticipated return of Ross Kemp as Grant Mitchell in October 2005 proved to be a sudden major ratings success, with the first two episodes consolidating to ratings of 13.21 to 13.34 million viewers. On Friday 11 November 2005, &quot;EastEnders&quot; was the first British drama to feature a two-minute silence. This episode later went on to win British Soap Award for &quot;Best Single Episode&quot;. In October 2006, Diederick Santer took over as executive producer. He introduced several characters to the show, including ethnic minority and homosexual characters to make the show &quot;feel more 21st century&quot;. Santer also reintroduced past and popular characters to the programme.

On 2 March 2007, BBC signed a deal with Google to put videos on YouTube. A behind the scenes video of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, hosted by Matt Di Angelo, who played Deano Wicks on the show, was put on the site the same day, and was followed by another on 6 March 2007. In April 2007, &quot;EastEnders&quot; became available to view on mobile phones, via 3G technology, for 3, Vodafone and Orange customers. On 21 April 2007, the BBC launched a new advertising campaign using the slogan &quot;There&#x27;s more to &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The first television advert showed Dot Branning with a refugee baby, Tomas, whom she took in under the pretence of being her grandson. The second and third featured Stacey Slater and Dawn Swann, respectively. There have also been adverts in magazines and on radio.

In 2009, producers introduced a limit on the number of speaking parts in each episode due to budget cuts, with an average of 16 characters per episode. The decision was criticised by Martin McGrath of Equity, who said: &quot;Trying to produce quality TV on the cheap is doomed to fail.&quot; The BBC responded by saying they had been working that way for some time and it had not affected the quality of the show.

=== 2010s ===
From 4 February 2010, CGI was used in the show for the first time, with the addition of computer-generated trains.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; celebrated its 25th anniversary on 19 February 2010. Santer came up with several plans to mark the occasion, including the show&#x27;s first episode to be broadcast live, the second wedding between Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and the return of Bianca&#x27;s relatives, mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), and siblings Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) and Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson). He told entertainment website Digital Spy, &quot;It&#x27;s really important that the feel of the week is active and exciting and not too reflective. There&#x27;ll be those moments for some of our longer-serving characters that briefly reflect on themselves and how they&#x27;ve changed. The characters don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s the 25th anniversary of anything, so it&#x27;d be absurd to contrive too many situations in which they&#x27;re reflective on the past. The main engine of that week is great stories that&#x27;ll get people talking.&quot; The live episode featured the death of Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) at the conclusion of the &quot;Who Killed Archie?&quot; storyline, which saw Bradley&#x27;s wife Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) reveal that she was the murderer. Viewing figures peaked at 16.6 million, which was the highest viewed episode in seven years. Other events to mark the anniversary were a spin-off DVD, &quot;EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford&quot;, and an Internet spin-off, &quot;&quot;.
Santer officially left &quot;EastEnders&quot; in March 2010, and was replaced by Bryan Kirkwood. Kirkwood&#x27;s first signing was the reintroduction of characters Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace), and his first new character was Vanessa Gold, played by Zöe Lucker. In April and May 2010, Kirkwood axed eight characters from the show, Barbara Windsor left her role of Peggy Mitchell, which left a hole in the show, which Kirkwood decided to fill by bringing back Kat and Alfie, which he said would &quot;herald the new era of &quot;EastEnders&quot;.&quot; &quot;EastEnders&quot; started broadcasting in high definition on 25 December 2010. Old sets had to be rebuilt, so The Queen Victoria set was burnt down in a storyline (and in reality) to facilitate this.

In November 2011, a storyline showed character Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick, selected to be a torch bearer for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In reality, Fenwick carried the torch through the setting of Albert Square, with live footage shown in the episode on 23 July 2012. This was the second live broadcast of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 2012, Kirkwood chose to leave his role as executive producer and was replaced by Lorraine Newman. The show lost many of its significant characters during this period. Newman stepped down after 16 months in the job in 2013 after the soap was criticised for its boring storylines and its lowest-ever figures pointing at around 4.8 million. Dominic Treadwell-Collins was appointed as the new executive producer on 19 August 2013 and was credited on 9 December. He axed multiple characters from the show and introduced the extended Carter family. He also introduced a long-running storyline, &quot;Who Killed Lucy Beale?&quot;, which peaked during the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2015 with a week of live episodes. Treadwell-Collins announced his departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot; on 18 February 2016.

Sean O&#x27;Connor, former &quot;EastEnders&quot; series story producer and then-editor of radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;, was announced to be taking over the role. Treadwell-Collins left on 6 May and O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first credited episode was broadcast on 11 July although his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the head of continuing drama series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee &quot;EastEnders&quot; along with O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s approach to the show was to have a firmer focus on realism, which he said was being &quot;true to &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ DNA and [finding] a way of capturing what it would be like if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now.&quot; He said that &quot;&quot;EastEnders&quot; has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we&#x27;ve diluted our unique selling point. I think we need to be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that&#x27;s part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn&#x27;t just be a distraction from your own life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters.&quot; O&#x27;Connor planned to stay with &quot;EastEnders&quot; until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary executive consultant. Kent said, &quot;John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean&#x27;s legacy while we recruit a long-term successor.&quot; Yorke initially returned for three months but his contract was later extended.

In July 2018, a special episode was aired as part of a knife crime storyline. This episode, which showed the funeral of Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) interspersed with real people talking about their true-life experiences of knife crime.
 On 8 August 2018, it was announced that Kate Oates, who has previously been a producer on the ITV soap operas &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, would become senior executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, as well as &quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;. Oates began her role in October, and continued to work with Yorke until the end of the year to &quot;ensure a smooth handover&quot;. It was also announced that Oates was looking for an executive producer to work under her. Jon Sen was announced on 10 December 2018 to be taking on the role.

In late 2016, popularity and viewership of &quot;EastEnders&quot; began to decline, with viewers criticising the storylines during the O&#x27;Connor reign, such as the killing of the Mitchell sisters and a storyline centred on the local bin collection. Since Yorke&#x27;s and Oates&#x27;s reigns, however, opinions towards the storylines have become more favourable, with storylines such as Ruby Allen&#x27;s (Louisa Lytton) sexual consent, which featured a special episode which &quot;broke new ground&quot; and knife crime, both of which have created &quot;vital&quot; discussions. The soap won the award for Best Continuing Drama at the 2019 British Academy Television Awards; its first high-profile award since 2016; however, in June 2019, &quot;EastEnders&quot; suffered its lowest ever ratings of 2.4 million due to its airing at 7 pm because of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. As of 2019, the soap is one of the most watched series on BBC iPlayer and averages around 5 million viewers per episode. The soap enjoyed a record-breaking year on the streaming platform in 2019, with viewers requesting to stream or download the show 234 million times, up 10% on 2018. The Christmas Day episode in 2019 became &quot;EastEnders&quot; biggest ever episode on BBC iPlayer, with 2.14 million viewer requests.

=== 2020s ===
In February 2020, &quot;EastEnders&quot; celebrated its 35th anniversary with a stunt on the River Thames leading to the death of Dennis Rickman Jr (Bleu Landau).

It was announced on 18 March 2020 that production had been suspended on &quot;EastEnders&quot; and other BBC Studios continuing dramas in light of new government guidelines following the COVID-19 pandemic, and that broadcast of the show would be reduced to two 30-minute episodes per week, broadcast on Mondays and Tuesdays. A spokesperson confirmed that the decision was made to use up pre-shot episodes more slowly so that &quot;EastEnders&quot; could remain on-screen for longer. Two months later, Charlotte Moore, the director of content at the BBC, announced plans for a return to production. She confirmed that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would return to filming during June 2020 and that there would be a transmission break between episodes filmed before and after production paused. When production recommenced, social distancing measures were utilised and the show&#x27;s cast were required to do their own hair and make-up, which is normally done by a make-up artist.

It was announced on 3 June 2020 that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would go on a transmission break following the broadcast of episode 6124 on 16 June. A behind-the-scenes show, &quot;EastEnders: Secrets From The Square&quot;, would air in the show&#x27;s place during the transmission break, hosted by television personality Stacey Dooley. The first episode of the week featured exclusive interviews with the show&#x27;s cast, while the second episode was a repeat of &quot;iconic&quot; episodes of the show. Beginning on 22 June 2020, Dooley interviewed two cast members together in the show&#x27;s restaurant set while observing social distancing measures. Kate Phillips, the controller of BBC Entertainment, explained that &quot;EastEnders: Secrets From The Square&quot; would be the &quot;perfect opportunity to celebrate the show&quot; in the absence of the show. Jon Sen, the show&#x27;s executive producer, expressed his excitement at the new series, dubbing it &quot;a unique opportunity to see from the cast themselves just what it is like to be part of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&quot;.

Plans for the show&#x27;s return to transmission were announced on 12 June 2020. It was confirmed that after the transmission break, the show would temporarily broadcast four 20-minute episodes per week, until it could return to its normal output. Sen explained that the challenges in production and filming of the show has led to the show&#x27;s reduced output, but also stated that the crew had been &quot;trialling techniques, filming methods and new ways of working&quot; to prepare the show for its return. Filming recommenced on 29 June, with episodes airing from 7 September 2020.

On 9 April 2021, following the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; that was due to be aired that night was postponed along with the final of &quot;Masterchef&quot;. In May 2021, it was announced that from 14 June 2021, boxsets of episodes would be uploaded to BBC iPlayer each Monday for three weeks. Executive producer Sen explained that the bi-annual scheduling conflicts that the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup cause to the soap, premiering four episodes on the streaming service would be beneficial for fans of the show who want to watch at their own chosen pace. Sen also confirmed that the episodes will still air on BBC One throughout the week. The release of these boxsets was extended for a further five weeks, due to similar impacts caused by the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On 12 October 2021, it was announced that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would partake in a special week-long crossover event involving multiple British soaps to promote the topic of climate change ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. During the week, beginning from 1 November, a social media clip featuring Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) from &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was featured on the programme while Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) from &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; was also referenced. Similar clips featuring the show&#x27;s own characters, Bailey Baker (Kara-Leah Fernandes) and Peter Beale (Dayle Hudson), were featured on &quot;Doctors&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; during the week.

In November 2021, it was announced that Sen would step down from his role as executive producer, and would be succeeded by former story producer Chris Clenshaw. Sen&#x27;s final credited episode as executive producer was broadcast on 10 March 2022 and coincided in a week of episodes that saw the arrest of serial killer Gray Atkins (Toby-Alexander Smith). From the week commencing on 7 March 2022, the show has been broadcast every weekday from Monday to Thursday in a 7:30 pm slot, making it the first time in the show&#x27;s history that the programme began airing permanently on Wednesdays. On 2 June 2022, &quot;EastEnders&quot; aired an episode celebrating the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall guest starred in the episode; it also marked the first executive producer credit for Clenshaw. Clenshaw&#x27;s first major decision as executive producer was the axing of five series regulars: Peter Beale (Dayle Hudson), Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ), Jada Lennox (Kelsey Calladine-Smith), Dana Monroe (Barbara Smith) and Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold). Viewers criticised the decision, feeling that some of the characters had potential to add to the soap. Clenshaw has since overseen the returns of Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) and Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter), the recast of Amy Mitchell (Ellie Dadd), as well as the reintroduction of Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), who returned from the dead after 25 years. Public opinion on Clenshaw then changed and he has been credited for improving ratings and garnering critical acclaim for the soap, with &quot;EastEnders&quot; winning the award for Best British Soap at the 2023 British Soap Awards and the award for Serial Drama at the 28th National Television Awards under his leadership.

On 26 September 2024, it was announced Clenshaw would step down as series executive producer in February 2025, following the soap&#x27;s 40th anniversary; Ben Wadey was announced as his successor.

== Setting ==

The central focus of &quot;EastEnders&quot; is the fictional Victorian square Albert Square in the fictional London Borough of Walford. In the show&#x27;s narrative, Albert Square is a 19th-century street, named after Prince Albert (1819–1861), the husband of Queen Victoria (1819–1901, reigned 1837–1901). Thus, central to Albert Square is The Queen Victoria pub (also known as The Queen Vic or The Vic). The show&#x27;s producers based the square&#x27;s design on Fassett Square in Dalston. There is also a market close to Fassett Square at Ridley Road. The postcode for the area, E8, was one of the working titles for the series. The name &quot;Walford&quot; is both a street in Dalston where Tony Holland lived and a blend of Walthamstow and Stratford—the areas of Greater London where the creators were born. Other parts of the square and set interiors are based on other locations. The railway bridge is based upon one near BBC Television Centre which carries the Hammersmith &amp; City line over Wood Lane W12, and the Queen Vic on the former College Park Hotel pub in Willesden at the end of Scrubs Lane at the junction with Harrow Road NW10 just a couple of miles from BBC Television Centre.

The current residents of The Queen Victoria Public House are landladies Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe), Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), Linda&#x27;s children Johnny (Charlie Suff), Ollie (Harry Farr) and Annie as well as Elaine&#x27;s husband George (Colin Salmon) and his daughter Anna (Molly Rainford). 

Walford East is a fictional London Underground station for Walford, and a tube map that was first seen on air in 1996 showed Walford East between Bow Road and West Ham, in the actual location of Bromley-by-Bow on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines.

Walford has the postal district of E20. It was named as if Walford were part of the actual E postcode area which covers much of east London, the &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;Eastern&quot;. E20 was entirely fictional when it was created, as London East postal districts stopped at E18 at the time. The show&#x27;s creators opted for E20 instead of E19 as it was thought to sound better.

In March 2011, Royal Mail allocated the E20 postal district to the 2012 Olympic Park. In September 2011, the postcode for Albert Square was revealed in an episode as E20 6PQ.

== Characters ==

&quot;EastEnders&quot; is built around the idea of relationships and strong families, with each character having a place in the community. This theme encompasses the whole square, making the entire community a family of sorts, prey to upsets and conflict, but pulling together in times of trouble. Co-creator Tony Holland was from a large East End family, and such families have typified &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The first central family was the combination of the Fowler family, consisting of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), her husband Arthur (Bill Treacher), and teenage children Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Michelle (Susan Tully). Pauline&#x27;s family, the Beales, consisted of Pauline&#x27;s twin brother Pete Beale (Peter Dean), his wife Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) and their teenage son Ian (Adam Woodyatt). Pauline and Pete&#x27;s domineering mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing) lived with Pauline and her family. Holland drew on the names of his own family for the characters.

The Watts and Mitchell families have been central to many notable &quot;EastEnders&quot; storylines, the show having been dominated by the Watts in the 1980s, with the 1990s focusing on the Mitchells and Butchers. The early 2000s saw a shift in attention towards the newly introduced female Slater clan, before a renewal of emphasis upon the restored Watts family beginning in 2003. In 2006, &quot;EastEnders&quot; became largely dominated by the Mitchell, Masood and Branning families, though the early 2010s also saw a renewed focus on the Moon and Slater family, and, from 2013 onwards, the Carters. In 2016, the Fowlers were revived and merged with the Slaters, with Martin Fowler (James Bye) marrying Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). The late 2010s saw the newly introduced Taylor family become central to the show&#x27;s main storylines, and in 2019, the first Sikh family, the Panesars, were introduced. The early 2020s was dominated by the Mitchells, Brannings, Panesars, Slaters, as well as the newly introduced Knight family. Key people involved in the production of &quot;EastEnders&quot; have stressed how important the idea of strong families is to the programme.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has an emphasis on strong family matriarchs, with examples including Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), helping to attract a female audience. John Yorke, the former BBC&#x27;s head of drama production, put this down to Tony Holland&#x27;s &quot;gay sensibility, which showed a love for strong women&quot;. The matriarchal role is one that has been seen in various reincarnations since the programme&#x27;s inception, often depicted as the centre of the family unit. The original matriarch was Lou Beale (Anna Wing), though later examples include Mo Harris (Laila Morse), Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia), Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), and Suki Panesar (Balvinder Sopal). These characters are often seen as being loud and interfering but most importantly, responsible for the well-being of the family.

The show often includes strong, brassy, long-suffering women who exhibit diva-like behaviour and stoically battle through an array of tragedy and misfortune. Such characters include Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Denise Fox (Diane Parish), Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Little Mo Mitchell (Kacey Ainsworth), Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman), Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks). The &quot;tart with a heart&quot; is another recurring character. Often, their promiscuity masks a hidden vulnerability and a desire to be loved. Such characters have included Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement), Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace).

A gender balance in the show is maintained via the inclusion of various &quot;macho&quot; male personalities such as Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), and George Knight (Colin Salmon), &quot;bad boys&quot; such as Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), and Ravi Gulati (Aaron Thiara) and &quot;heartthrobs&quot; such as Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), Joe Wicks (Paul Nicholls), Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), Joey Branning (David Witts), Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) and Zack Hudson (James Farrar). Another recurring male character type is the smartly dressed businessman, often involved in gang culture and crime and seen as a local authority figure. Examples include Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), and Nish Panesar (Navin Chowdhry). Following criticism aimed at the show&#x27;s over-emphasis on &quot;gangsters&quot; in 2005, such characters have been significantly reduced. Another recurring male character seen in &quot;EastEnders&quot; is the &quot;loser&quot; or &quot;soft touch&quot;, males often comically under the thumb of their female counterparts, which have included Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves), Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) and Howie Danes (Delroy Atkinson).

Other recurring character types that have appeared throughout the serial are &quot;cheeky-chappies&quot; Pete Beale (Peter Dean), Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), &quot;lost girls&quot; such as Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), and Hayley Slater (Katie Jarvis), delinquents such as Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington/Clay Milner Russell) and Keegan Baker (Zack Morris), &quot;villains&quot; such as Nick Cotton (John Altman), Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), May Wright (Amanda Drew), Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti), Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) and Gray Atkins (Toby-Alexander Smith), &quot;bitches&quot; such as Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins), Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield/Hetti Bywater), Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Babe Smith (Annette Badland) and Suki Panesar (Balvinder Sopal), &quot;brawlers&quot; or &quot;fighters&quot; such as Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), and Priya Nandra-Hart (Sophie Khan Levy), and cockney &quot;wide boys&quot; or &quot;wheeler dealers&quot; such as Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Kevin Wicks (Phil Daniels), Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), Kheerat Panesar (Jaz Deol) and Tom &quot;Rocky&quot; Cotton (Brian Conley).

Over the years, &quot;EastEnders&quot; has typically featured a number of elderly residents, who are used to show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale (Anna Wing), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Dot Cotton (June Brown). Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher (Edna Doré), Jules Tavernier (Tommy Eytle), Marge Green (Pat Coombs), Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly), Jim Branning (John Bardon), Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), Mo Harris (Laila Morse), Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), Les Coker (Roger Sloman), Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins), Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), Stan Carter (Timothy West), Babe Smith (Annette Badland), Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), Ted Murray (Christopher Timothy), Joyce Murray (Maggie Steed), Arshad Ahmed (Madhav Sharma), Mariam Ahmed (Indira Joshi) and Vi Highway (Gwen Taylor). The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who portrayed Lou Beale in the show. She commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced. It gets too lightweight.&quot;

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has been known to feature a &quot;comedy double-act&quot;, originally demonstrated with the characters of Dot and Ethel, whose friendship was one of the serial&#x27;s most enduring. Other examples include Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton) and Trevor Short (Phil McDermott). In 1989 especially, characters were brought in who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted. Such characters included Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright)—a brassy maneater; Marge Green—a batty older lady played by veteran comedy actress Pat Coombs; Trevor Short (Phil McDermott)—the &quot;village idiot&quot;; his friend, northern heartbreaker Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton); wheeler-dealer Vince Johnson (Hepburn Graham); and Laurie Bates (Gary Powell), who became Pete Beale&#x27;s (Peter Dean) sparring partner. The majority of &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ characters are working-class. Middle-class characters do occasionally become regulars, but have been less successful and rarely become long-term characters. In the main, middle-class characters exist as villains, such as James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde), May Wright (Amanda Drew), Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) and Gray Atkins (Toby-Alexander Smith), or are used to promote positive liberal influences, such as Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May) and Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender).

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has always featured a culturally diverse cast which has included black, Asian, Turkish, Polish and Latvian characters. &quot;The expansion of minority representation signals a move away from the traditional soap opera format, providing more opportunities for audience identification with the characters and hence a wider appeal&quot;. Despite this, the programme has been criticised by the Commission for Racial Equality, which argued in 2002 that &quot;EastEnders&quot; was not giving a realistic representation of the East End&#x27;s &quot;ethnic make-up&quot;. It suggested that the average proportion of visible minority faces on &quot;EastEnders&quot; was substantially lower than the actual ethnic minority population in East London boroughs, and it, therefore, reflected the East End in the 1960s, not the East End of the 2000s. The programme has since attempted to address these issues. A sari shop was opened and various characters of different ethnicities were introduced throughout 2006 and 2007, including the Fox family, the Ahmeds, and various background artists. This was part of producer Diederick Santer&#x27;s plan to &quot;diversify&quot;, to make &quot;EastEnders&quot; &quot;feel more 21st century&quot;. &quot;EastEnders&quot; has had varying success with ethnic minority characters. Possibly the least successful were the Indian Ferreira family, who were not well received by critics or viewers and were dismissed as unrealistic by the Asian community in the UK.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has been praised for its portrayal of characters with disabilities, including Adam Best (David Proud) (spina bifida), Noah Chambers (Micah Thomas) and Frankie Lewis (Rose Ayling-Ellis) (deaf), Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and her daughter Stacey (Lacey Turner) (bipolar disorder), Janet Mitchell (Grace) (Down syndrome), Jim Branning (John Bardon) (stroke) and Dinah Wilson (Anjela Lauren Smith) (multiple sclerosis). The show also features a large number of gay, lesbian and bisexual characters (see list of soap operas with LGBT characters), including Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), Barry Clark (Gary Hailes), Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford), Tony Hills (Mark Homer), Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), Naomi Julien (Petra Letang), Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), Tosh Mackintosh (Rebecca Scroggs), Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Syed Masood (Marc Elliott), Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid/Max Bowden), Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), Iqra Ahmed (Priya Davdra), Ash Panesar (Gurlaine Kaur Garcha), Bernadette Taylor (Clair Norris), Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and Eve Unwin (Heather Peace). Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington), a transgender character, was introduced in 2015.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has a high cast turnover and characters are regularly changed to facilitate storylines or refresh the format. The show has also become known for the return of characters after they have left the show. Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) returned in August 2012 for her third stint on the show. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) returned, 14 years after he was believed to have died, in September 2003, a feat repeated by Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) in 2015, and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) in 2023. Speaking extras, including Tracey the barmaid (Jane Slaughter) (who has been in the show since the first episode in 1985), have made appearances throughout the show&#x27;s duration without being the focus of any major storylines. The character of Nick Cotton (John Altman) gained a reputation for making constant exits and returns since the programme&#x27;s first year until the character died in 2015.

, Gillian Taylforth, Letitia Dean and Adam Woodyatt are the only members of the original cast remaining in the show, in their roles of Kathy Beale, Sharon Watts and Ian Beale respectively. Tracey is the longest-serving female character in the show, having appeared since 1985, albeit as a minor character.

== Storylines ==

&quot;EastEnders&quot; programme makers took the decision that the show was to be about &quot;everyday life&quot; in the inner city &quot;today&quot; and regarded it as a &quot;slice of life&quot;. Creator/producer Julia Smith declared that &quot;We don&#x27;t make life, we reflect it&quot;. She also said, &quot;We decided to go for a realistic, fairly outspoken type of drama which could encompass stories about homosexuality, rape, unemployment, racial prejudice, etc., in a believable context. Above all, we wanted realism&quot;. In 2011, the head of BBC drama, John Yorke, said that the real East End had changed significantly since &quot;EastEnders&quot; started, and the show no longer truly reflected real life, but that it had an &quot;emotional truthfulness&quot; and was partly &quot;true to the original vision&quot; and partly &quot;adapt[ing] to a changing world&quot;, adding that &quot;If it was a show where every house cost a fortune and everyone drove a Lexus, it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;EastEnders&quot;. You have to show shades of that change, but certain things are immutable, I would argue, like The Vic and the market.&quot;

In the 1980s, &quot;EastEnders&quot; featured &quot;gritty&quot; storylines involving drugs and crime, representing the issues faced by working-class Britain under Thatcherism. Storylines included the cot death of 14-month-old Hassan Osman, Nick Cotton&#x27;s (John Altman) homophobia, racism and murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton), Arthur Fowler&#x27;s (Bill Treacher) unemployment reflecting the recession of the 1980s, the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) in 1988 by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) and Michelle Fowler&#x27;s (Susan Tully) teenage pregnancy. The show also dealt with prostitution, mixed-race relationships, shoplifting, sexism, divorce, domestic violence and mugging. In 1989, the programme came under criticism in the British media for being too depressing, and according to writer Colin Brake, the programme makers were determined to change this. In 1989, there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted. Brake suggested that humour was an important element in &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than before. He classed 1989&#x27;s changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of &quot;EastEnders&quot; entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme&#x27;s credibility. Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between &quot;light and heavy storylines&quot; gave the illusion that the show had lost a &quot;certain edge&quot;.

As the show progressed into the 1990s, &quot;EastEnders&quot; still featured hard-hitting issues such as Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) revealing he was HIV positive in 1991, the death of his wife Gill (Susanna Dawson) from an AIDS-related illness in 1992, murder, adoption, abortion, Peggy Mitchell&#x27;s (Barbara Windsor) battle with breast cancer, and Phil Mitchell&#x27;s (Steve McFadden) alcoholism and violence towards wife Kathy. Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler&#x27;s HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community. Still, heterosexual Mark struggled with various issues connected to his HIV status, including public fears of contamination, a marriage breakdown connected to his inability to have children and the side effects of combination therapies.

In the early 2000s, &quot;EastEnders&quot; covered the issue of euthanasia with Ethel Skinner&#x27;s (Gretchen Franklin) death in a pact with her friend Dot Cotton (June Brown), the unveiling of Kat Slater&#x27;s (Jessie Wallace) sexual abuse by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) as a child (which led to the birth of her daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan), who had been brought up to believe that Kat was her sister), the domestic abuse of Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) by husband Trevor (Alex Ferns) (which involved marital rape and culminated in Trevor&#x27;s death after he tried to kill Little Mo in a fire), Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) giving birth at the age of 15 and then putting her baby up for adoption, and Janine Butcher&#x27;s (Charlie Brooks) prostitution, agoraphobia and drug addiction. The soap also tackled the issue of mental illness and carers of people who have mental conditions, illustrated with mother and daughter Jean (Gillian Wright) and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); Jean has bipolar disorder, and teenage daughter Stacey was her carer (this storyline won a Mental Health Media Award in September 2006). Stacey went on to struggle with the disorder herself. The issue of illiteracy was highlighted by the characters of middle-aged Keith (David Spinx) and his young son Darren (Charlie G. Hawkins). &quot;EastEnders&quot; has also covered the issue of Down syndrome, as Billy (Perry Fenwick) and Honey Mitchell&#x27;s (Emma Barton) baby, Janet Mitchell (Grace), was born with the condition in 2006. &quot;EastEnders&quot; covered child abuse with its storyline involving Phil Mitchell&#x27;s (Steve McFadden) 11-year-old son Ben (Charlie Jones) and lawyer girlfriend Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and child grooming involving the characters Tony King (Chris Coghill) as the perpetrator and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) as the victim.

Aside from this, soap opera staples of youthful romance, jealousy, domestic rivalry, gossip and extramarital affairs are regularly featured, with high-profile storylines occurring several times a year. Whodunits also feature regularly, including the &quot;Who Shot Phil?&quot; story arc in 2001 that attracted over 19 million viewers and was one of the biggest successes in British soap television; the &quot;Who Killed Archie?&quot; storyline, which was revealed in a special live episode of the show that drew a peak of 17 million viewers; and the &quot;Who Killed Lucy Beale?&quot; saga. The most recent whodunit happened at Christmas 2023, where The Six storyline saw Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) be murdered by Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), and covered up by five other residents present that night.

== Production ==
=== Set ===

The exterior set for the fictional Albert Square is located in the permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least 15 years at a cost of £750,000. The &quot;EastEnders&quot; lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made to look as if it had been standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.

The walls were intentionally built crooked to give them an aged appearance. The drains around the set are real so rainwater can naturally flow from the streets. The square was built in two phases with only three sides being built, plus Bridge Street, to begin with in 1984, in time to be used for the show&#x27;s first episode. Then in 1986, Harris added an extension to the set, building the fourth side of Albert Square, and in 1987, Turpin Road began to be featured more, which included buildings such as The Dagmar.

In 1993, George Street was added, and soon after Walford East Underground station was built, to create further locations when &quot;EastEnders&quot; went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings.

In February 2008, it was reported that the set would transfer to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, where a new set would be built as the set was looking &quot;shabby&quot;, with its flaws showing up on high-definition television broadcasts; however, by April 2010 a follow-up report confirmed that Albert Square would remain at Elstree Studios for at least another four years, taking the set through its 25th anniversary. The set was consequently rebuilt for high definition on the same site, using mostly real brick with some areas using a new improved plastic brick. Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some storylines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the Queen Vic fire.

In 2014, then executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said that he wanted Albert Square to look like a real-life east London neighbourhood so that the soap would &quot;better reflect the more fashionable areas of east London beloved of young professionals&quot; giving a flavour of the &quot;creeping gentrification&quot; of east London. He added: &quot;It should feel more like London. It&#x27;s been frozen in aspic for too long.&quot; The BBC announced that it would rebuild the &quot;EastEnders&quot; set to secure the long-term future of the show, with completion expected to be in 2018. The set would provide a modern, upgraded exterior filming resource for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and copy the appearance of the existing buildings; however, it would be 20 per cent bigger, in order to enable greater editorial ambition and improve working conditions for staff. A temporary set would be created on-site to enable filming to continue while the permanent structure was rebuilt.

In May 2016, the rebuild was delayed until 2020, and forecast to cost in excess of £15 million, although the main part of the set was scheduled to be able to start filming in May 2019. In December 2018, it was revealed that the new set was now planned to cost £59 million but a National Audit Office (NAO) report stated that it would actually cost £86.7 million and be completed two-and-a-half years later than planned, in 2023; the NAO concluded that the BBC &quot;could not provide value for money on the project&quot;. The NAO&#x27;s forecast cost was more than the annual combined budget for BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2. The BBC said the new set would be more suitable for HD filming, and better reflect the modern East End of London. In March 2019 there was criticism from a group of MPs about how the BBC handled the redevelopment of the set. In March 2020, during the suspension of filming, the interior sets were used for a new adaptation of &quot;Talking Heads&quot;. This marked the first time that it had been used for anything other than &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In January 2022, the new £86.7m exterior set was officially unveiled by the BBC, replacing the original set built in 1984. The new scenes from the new set first appeared in episodes airing in spring that year.

=== Filming ===
The majority of &quot;EastEnders&quot; episodes are filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. In January 1987, &quot;EastEnders&quot; had three production teams each comprising a director, production manager, production assistant and assistant floor manager. Other permanent staff included the producer&#x27;s office, script department and designer, meaning between 30 and 35 people would be working full-time on &quot;EastEnders&quot;, rising to 60 to 70 on filming days. When the number of episodes was increased to four per week, more studio space was needed, so &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was moved from its studio at Elstree to BBC Television Centre in April 2001. Episodes are produced in &quot;quartets&quot; of four episodes, each of which starts filming on a Tuesday and takes nine days to record. Each day, between 25 and 30 scenes are recorded. During the filming week, actors can film for as many as eight to 12 episodes. Exterior scenes are filmed on a specially constructed film lot, and interior scenes take place in six studios. The episodes are usually filmed about six to eight weeks in advance of broadcast. During the winter period, filming can take place up to 12 weeks in advance, due to less daylight for outdoor filming sessions. This time difference has been known to cause problems when filming outdoor scenes. On 8 February 2007, heavy snow fell on the set and filming had to be cancelled as the scenes due to be filmed on the day were to be transmitted in April. &quot;EastEnders&quot; is normally recorded using four cameras. When a quartet is completed, it is edited by the director, videotape editor and script supervisor. The producer then reviews the edits and decides if anything needs to be re-edited, which the director will do. A week later, sound is added to the episodes and they are technically reviewed, and are ready for transmission if they are deemed of acceptable quality.

Although episodes are predominantly recorded weeks before they are broadcast, occasionally, &quot;EastEnders&quot; includes current events. In 1987, &quot;EastEnders&quot; covered the general election. Using a plan devised by co-creators Smith and Holland, five minutes of material was cut from four of the pre-recorded episodes preceding the election. These were replaced by specially recorded election material, including representatives from each major party, and a scene recorded on the day after the election reflecting the result, which was broadcast the following Tuesday. The result of the 2010 general election was referenced on 7 May 2010 episode. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, actors filmed short scenes following the tournament&#x27;s events that were edited into the programme in the following episode. Last-minute scenes have also been recorded to reference the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1995, the two-minute silence on Remembrance Day 2005 (2005 also being the year for the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar), Barack Obama&#x27;s election victory in 2008, the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review, Andy Murray winning the men&#x27;s singles at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the birth of Prince George of Wales, Scotland voting no against independence in 2014, and the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; is often filmed on location, away from the studios in Borehamwood. Sometimes an entire quartet is filmed on location, which has a practical function and are the result of &quot;EastEnders&quot; making a &quot;double bank&quot;, when an extra week&#x27;s worth of episodes are recorded at the same time as the regular schedule, enabling the production of the programme to stop for a two-week break at Christmas. These episodes often air in late June or early July and again in late October or early November. The first time this happened was in December 1985 when Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) travelled to the Southend-on-Sea to find their son Mark, who had run away from home. In 1986, &quot;EastEnders&quot; filmed overseas for the first time, in Venice, and this was also the first time it was not shot on videotape, as a union rule at the time prevented producers taking a video crew abroad and a film crew had to be used instead. In 2011, it was reported that eight per cent of the series is filmed on location.

If scenes during a normal week are to be filmed on location, this is done during the normal recording week. Off-set locations that have been used for filming include Clacton (1989), Devon (September 1990), Hertfordshire (used for scenes set in Gretna Green in July 1991), Portsmouth (November 1991), Milan (1997), Ireland (1997), Amsterdam (December 1999), Brighton (2001) and Portugal (2003). In 2003, filming took place at Loch Fyne Hotel and Leisure Club in Inveraray, The Arkinglass Estate in Cairndow and Grims Dyke Hotel, Harrow Weald, north London, for a week of episodes set in Scotland. The episode shown on 9 April 2007 featured scenes filmed at St Giles Church and The Blacksmiths Arms public house in Wormshill, the Ringlestone Inn, two miles away and Court Lodge Farm in Stansted, Kent. and the Port of Dover, Kent. .

Other locations have included the court house, a disused office block, Evershed House, and St Peter&#x27;s Church, all in St Albans, an abandoned mental facility in Worthing, and a wedding dress shop in Muswell Hill, north London. A week of episodes in 2011 saw filming take place on a beach in Thorpe Bay and a pier in Southend-on-Sea—during which a stuntman was injured when a gust of wind threw him off balance and he fell onto rocks— with other scenes filmed on the Essex coast. In 2012, filming took place in Keynsham, Somerset. In January 2013, on-location filming at Grahame Park in Colindale, north London, was interrupted by at least seven youths who threw a firework at the set and threatened members of the crew. In October 2013, scenes were filmed on a road near London Southend Airport in Essex.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has featured seven live broadcasts. For its 25th anniversary in February 2010, a live episode was broadcast in which Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) was revealed as Archie Mitchell&#x27;s (Larry Lamb) killer. Turner was told only 30 minutes before the live episode and to maintain suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found out at the same time as the public, when the episode was broadcast. On 23 July 2012, a segment of that evening&#x27;s episode was screened live as Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carried the Olympic flame around Walford in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In February 2015, for the soap&#x27;s 30th anniversary, five episodes in a week featured live inserts throughout them. Episodes airing on Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 (which featured an hour long episode and a second episode) all featured at least one live insert. The show revealed that the killer of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was her younger brother, Bobby (Eliot Carrington), during the second episode on Thursday, after a 10-month mystery regarding who killed her. In a flashback episode which revisited the night of the murder, Bobby was revealed to have killed his sister. The aftermath episode, which aired on Friday 20, was completely live and explained in detail Lucy&#x27;s death. Carrington was told he was Lucy&#x27;s killer on Monday 16, while Laurie Brett (who plays Bobby&#x27;s adoptive mother, Jane) was informed in November, due to the character playing a major role in the cover-up of Lucy&#x27;s murder. Bywater only discovered Bobby was responsible for Lucy&#x27;s death on the morning of Thursday, 19 February, several hours before they filmed the scenes revealing Bobby as Lucy&#x27;s killer.

=== Post-production ===
Each episode should run for 27 minutes and 15 seconds; however, if any episode runs over or under then it is the job of post-production to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As noted in the 1994 behind-the-scenes book, &quot;EastEnders: The First 10 Years&quot;, after filming, tapes were sent to the videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director&#x27;s notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made. The episode was then copied onto D3 video. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the BBC&#x27;s technical standard for broadcasting.

Since 2010, &quot;EastEnders&quot; no longer uses tapes in the recording or editing process. After footage is recorded, the material is sent digitally to the post-production team. The editors then assemble all the scenes recorded for the director to view and note any changes that are needed. The sound team also have the capability to access the edited episode, enabling them to dub the sound and create the final version.

=== Budgets and costs ===
According to the book &quot;How to Study Television&quot;, in 1995 &quot;EastEnders&quot; cost the BBC £40,000 per episode on average. A 2012 agreement between the BBC, the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain and the Personal Managers&#x27; Association set out the pay rate for &quot;EastEnders&quot; scripts as £137.70 per minute of transmission time (£4,131 for 30 minutes), which is 85 per cent of the rate for scripts for other BBC television series. The writers would be paid 75 per cent of that fee for any repeats of the episode. In 2011, it was reported that actors receive a per-episode fee of between £400 and £1,200, and are guaranteed a certain number of episodes per year, perhaps as few as 30 or as many as 100, therefore annual salaries could range from £12,000 to £200,000 depending on the popularity of a character. Some actors&#x27; salaries were leaked in 2006, revealing that Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Fowler) was paid £150,000, Cliff Parisi (Minty Peterson) received £220,000, Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) and Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) each received £360,000 and Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler) had a salary of £370,000. In 2017, it was revealed that Danny Dyer (Mick Carter) and Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale) were the highest-paid actors in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, earning between £200,000 and £249,999, followed by Laurie Brett (Jane Beale), Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts), Tameka Empson (Kim Fox), Linda Henry (Shirley Carter), Scott Maslen (Jack Branning), Diane Parish (Denise Fox), Gillian Taylforth (Kathy Beale) and Lacey Turner (Stacey Slater), earning between £150,000 and £199,999.

A 2011 report from the National Audit Office (NAO) showed that &quot;EastEnders&quot; had an annual budget of £29.9 million. Of that, £2.9 million was spent on scripts and £6.9 million went towards paying actors, extras and chaperones for child actors. According to the NAO, BBC executives approved £500,000 of additional funding for the 25th anniversary live episode (19 February 2010). With a total cost of £696,000, the difference was covered from the 2009–2010 series budget for &quot;EastEnders&quot;. When repeats and omnibus editions are shown, the BBC pays additional fees to cast and scriptwriters and incurs additional editing costs, which in the period 2009–2010, amounted to £5.5million. According to a Radio Times article for 212 episodes it works out at £141,000 per episode or 3.5p per viewer hour.

=== Sustainability ===
In 2014, two new studios were built and they were equipped with low-energy lighting which has saved approximately 90,000 kwh per year. A carbon literacy course was run with heads of departments of &quot;EastEnders&quot; attending and as a result, representatives from each department agreed to meet quarterly to share new sustainability ideas. The paper usage was reduced by 50 per cent across script distribution and other weekly documents and 20 per cent across all other paper usage. The production team now uses recycled paper and stationery.

Also changes to working online has also saved transportation cost of distribution 2,500 DVDs per year. Sets, costumes, paste pots and paint are all recycled by the design department. Cars used by the studio are low emission vehicles and the production team take more efficient energy efficient generators out on location. Caterers no longer use polystyrene cups and recycling on location must be provided.

As a result of &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ sustainability, it was awarded albert+, an award that recognises the production&#x27;s commitment to becoming a more eco-friendly television production. The albert+ logo was first shown at the end of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; titles for episode 5281 on 9 May 2016.

== Scheduling ==
=== Broadcast ===
Since 1985, &quot;EastEnders&quot; has remained at the centre of BBC One&#x27;s primetime schedule. From 2001 to 2022, it was broadcast at 7:30pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 8pm on Monday and Friday. &quot;EastEnders&quot; was originally broadcast twice weekly at 7:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 19 February 1985; however, in September 1985 the two episodes were moved to 7:30pm as Michael Grade did not want the soap running in direct competition with &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, and this remained the same until 7 April 1994. The BBC had originally planned to take advantage of the &quot;summer break&quot; that &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; usually took to capitalise on ratings, but ITV added extra episodes and repeats so that &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; was not taken off the air over the summer. Realising the futility of the situation, Grade decided to move the show to the later 7:30pm slot.

The show&#x27;s output then increased to three times a week on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11 April 1994 until 2 August 2001.
From 10 August 2001, &quot;EastEnders&quot; then added its fourth episode (shown on Fridays). This caused some controversy, as the first Friday episode clashed with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which was moved to 8pm to make way for an hour-long episode of rural soap &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. In this first head-to-head battle, &quot;EastEnders&quot; claimed victory over its rival.

In early 2003, viewers could watch episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; on digital channel BBC Three before they were broadcast on BBC One. This was to coincide with the relaunch of the channel and helped BBC Three break the one million viewers mark for the first time with 1.03 million who watched to see Mark Fowler&#x27;s departure. According to the &quot;EastEnders&quot; website, there are, on average, 208 episodes outputted each year.

On 21 February 2022, it was announced that from 7 March 2022, &quot;EastEnders&quot; would begin airing from Monday to Thursday at 7:30pm, therefore no longer airing on a Friday. This meant that &quot;EastEnders&quot; would clash with &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, but the producers stated that due to the importance of online streaming figures, they were not concerned about the soaps clashing on the live television guides.

=== Repeats ===
The omnibus edition, a compilation of the week&#x27;s episodes in a continuous sequence, originally aired on BBC One on Sunday afternoons, until 1 April 2012, when it was changed to a late Friday night or early Saturday morning slot, commencing on 6 April 2012, though the exact time differed. It reverted to a weekend daytime slot from January 2013 on BBC Two. In 2014, the omnibus moved back to around midnight on Friday nights, and in April 2015, the omnibus was axed, following detailed audience research and the introduction of 30-day catch up on BBC iPlayer and the planning of BBC One +1. The last omnibus on the BBC was shown on 24 April 2015. While W was showing same-day repeats of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, they also returned the weekend omnibus, starting on 20 February 2016.

From 20 February to 26 May 1995, as part of the programme&#x27;s 10th anniversary celebrations, episodes from 1985 were repeated each weekday morning at 10am, starting from episode one. Four specially selected episodes from 1985, 1986 and 1987 were also repeated on BBC1 on Friday evenings at 8pm under the banner &quot;The Unforgettable EastEnders&quot;. These included the wedding of Michelle Fowler and Lofty Holloway, the revelation of the father of Michelle&#x27;s baby, a two-hander between Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner and the 1986 Christmas episode featuring Den Watts presenting Angie Watts with divorce papers.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; was regularly repeated at 10pm on BBC Choice from the channel&#x27;s launch in 1998, a practice continued by BBC Three for many years until mid-2012 with the repeat moving to 10:30pm. From 25 December 2010 – 29 April 2011 and 31 July 2012 – 13 August 2012 to the show was repeated on BBC HD in a Simulcast with BBC Three. In 2015, the BBC Three repeat moved back to 10pm. In February 2016, the repeat moved to W, the rebranded Watch, after BBC Three became an online-only channel. W stopped showing &quot;EastEnders&quot; in April 2018. Following the reinstatement of BBC Three as a linear channel in 2022, the nightly &#x27;narrative repeat&#x27; was not reinstated; instead, the channel retransmits that week&#x27;s four BBC One episodes at the weekend, airing two episodes on each of Saturday and Sunday evenings, unless live sports or music/events coverage takes precedence. Episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; were available on-demand through BBC iPlayer for 30 days after their original screening; however, starting with the episode broadcast on 4 April 2022, episodes were made available indefinitely.

On 1 December 2012, the BBC uploaded the first 54 episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; to YouTube, and on 23 July 2013 it uploaded a further 14 episodes bringing the total to 68. These have since been taken down. In April 2018, it was announced that the Drama channel would be showing repeats of the show, starting on 6 August 2018 during weekdays; they are also available on-demand on the U catch-up service for 30 days after the broadcast. In December 2019, Christmas episodes were added to Britbox UK.

=== International broadcast ===

&quot;EastEnders&quot; is broadcast around the world in many English-speaking countries. New Zealand became the first to broadcast &quot;EastEnders&quot; overseas, the first episode being shown on 30 August 1985. This was followed by the Netherlands on 8 December 1986, Australia on 5 January 1987, Norway on 27 April, and Barcelona on 30 June (dubbed into Catalan). On 9 July 1987, it was announced that the show would be aired in the United States on PBS. BBC Worldwide licensed 200 hours of &quot;EastEnders&quot; for broadcast in Serbia on RTS (dubbed into Serbian); it began airing the first episode in December 1997. The series was broadcast in the United States until BBC America ceased broadcasts of the serial in 2003, amidst fan protests. In June 2004, the satellite television provider Dish Network picked up &quot;EastEnders&quot;, broadcasting episodes starting at the point when BBC America had ceased broadcasting them, offering the series as a pay-per-view item. Episodes air two months behind the UK schedule. Episodes from prior years are still shown on various PBS stations in the US. Since 7 March 2017, &quot;EastEnders&quot; has been available in the United States on demand, 24 hours after it has aired in the United Kingdom via BritBox, a joint venture between the BBC and ITV.

The series was screened in Australia by ABC TV from 1987 until 1991. It is aired in Australia on Satellite &amp; Streaming services on BBC UKTV, from Mondays to Thursdays 7:50pm–8:30pm with two advertisement breaks of five minutes each. Episodes are shown roughly one week after their UK broadcast. In New Zealand, it was shown by TVNZ on TVNZ 1 for several years, and then on Prime each weekday afternoon. It is shown on BBC UKTV from Mondays to Thursdays at 8pm. Episodes are roughly two weeks behind the UK.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; is shown on BBC Entertainment (formerly BBC Prime) in Europe and in Africa, where it is approximately six episodes behind the UK. It was also shown on BBC Prime in Asia, but when the channel was replaced by BBC Entertainment, it ceased broadcasting the series. In Canada, &quot;EastEnders&quot; was shown on BBC Canada until 2010, at which point it was picked up by VisionTV.

In Ireland, &quot;EastEnders&quot; was shown on TV3 from September 1998 until March 2001, when it moved over to RTÉ One, after RTÉ lost to TV3 the rights to air rival soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Additionally, episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; are available on-demand through RTÉ Online for seven days after their original screening.

== Overseas versions ==
In 1991 the BBC sold the programme&#x27;s format rights to a Dutch production company IDTV, the programme was renamed &quot;Het Oude Noorden&quot; (Translation: Old North). The Dutch version was re-written from already existing &quot;EastEnders&quot; scripts. The schedule remained the same as &quot;EastEnders&quot; with twice weekly episodes; however, some notable changes included the programme now being set in Rotterdam rather than London, characters being given Dutch names (Den and Angie became Ger and Ankie) and The Queen Victoria pub being renamed Cade Faas.

According to Barbara Jurgen who re-wrote the scripts for a Dutch audience he said &quot;The power of the show is undeniable. The scripts are full of hard, sharp drama, plus great one-liners which will translate well to Holland.&quot; The Dutch version began broadcasting on VARA 13 March 1993 but was cancelled after 20 episodes.

== Spin-offs and merchandise ==

On 26 December 1988, the first &quot;EastEnders&quot; &quot;bubble&quot; was shown, titled &quot;CivvyStreet&quot;. Since then, &quot;Return of Nick Cotton&quot; (2000), &quot;Ricky &amp; Bianca&quot; (2002), &quot;Dot&#x27;s Story&quot; (2003), &quot;Perfectly Frank&quot; (2003) and &quot;Pat and Mo&quot; (2004) have all been broadcast, each episode looking into lives of various characters and revealing part of their backstories or lives since leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 1993, the two-part story &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, a charity cross-over with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, was shown.

In 1998, &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot; was launched on BBC Choice (now BBC Three). The show takes a look behind the scenes of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; and investigates particular places, characters or families within &quot;EastEnders&quot;. An episode of &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot; that was commissioned for BBC Three attracted 611,000 viewers. As part of the BBC&#x27;s digital push, &quot;EastEnders Xtra&quot; was introduced in 2005. The show was presented by Angellica Bell and was available to digital viewers at 8:30 pm on Monday nights. It was also shown after the Sunday omnibus. The series went behind the scenes of the show and spoke to some of the cast members. A new breed of behind-the-scenes programmes have been broadcast on BBC Three since 1 December 2006. These are all documentaries related to current storylines in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, in a similar format to &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot;, though not using the &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot; name.

In October 2009, a 12-part online spin-off series entitled &quot;&quot; was announced. The series was conceived by executive producer Diederick Santer &quot;as a way of nurturing new, young talent, both on- and off-screen, and exploring the stories of the soaps&#x27; anonymous bystanders.&quot; &quot;E20&quot; features a group of sixth-form characters and targets the &quot;&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; demographic&quot;. It was written by a team of young writers and was shown three times a week on the &quot;EastEnders&quot; website from 8 January 2010. A second 10-part series started in September 2010, with twice-weekly episodes available online and an omnibus on BBC Three. A third series of 15 episodes started in September 2011.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; and rival soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; took part in a crossover episode for Children in Need on 19 November 2010 called &quot;East Street&quot;. On 4 April 2015, &quot;EastEnders&quot; confirmed plans for a BBC One series featuring Kat and Alfie Moon. The six-part drama, &quot;Kat &amp; Alfie: Redwater&quot;, was created by executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins and his team. In the spin-off, the Moons visit Ireland where they &quot;search for answers to some very big questions&quot;.

Until its closure, BBC Store released 553 &quot;EastEnders&quot; episodes from various years, including the special episode &quot;CivvyStreet&quot;, available to buy as digital downloads.

== Popularity and viewership ==
An example of &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ popularity is that after episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pickup. Over five minutes, power demand rises by three GW, the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.75 million kettles. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge, asking for additional power from France if necessary.

=== Ratings ===
&quot;EastEnders&quot; is the BBC&#x27;s most consistent programme in terms of ratings, and as of 2024, episodes typically receive between 3 and 4 million viewers. &quot;EastEnders&quot; two biggest ratings rivals are the ITV soaps &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (produced by Granada Television in Manchester) and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (produced by Yorkshire Television in Leeds).

The launch show in 1985 attracted 17.35 million viewers. 25 July 1985 was the first time the show&#x27;s viewership rose to first position in the weekly top 10 shows for BBC One. The highest-rated episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; is the Christmas Day 1986 episode, which attracted a combined 30.15 million viewers who tuned into either the original transmission or the omnibus to see Den Watts hand over divorce papers to his wife Angie. This remains the highest rated episode of a soap in British television history.

In 2001, &quot;EastEnders&quot; clashed with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for the first time. &quot;EastEnders&quot; won the battle with 8.4 million viewers (41% share) whilst &quot;Coronation Street&quot; lagged behind with 7.3 million viewers (34% share). On 21 September 2004, Louise Berridge, the then executive producer, quit following criticism of the show. The following day the show received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; against it. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was watched by 8.1 million viewers. The poor ratings motivated the press into reporting viewers were bored with implausible and ill-thought-out storylines. Under new producers, &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; continued to clash at times, and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; tended to come out on top, giving &quot;EastEnders&quot; lower than average ratings. In 2006, &quot;EastEnders&quot; regularly attracted between 8 and 12 million viewers in official ratings. &quot;EastEnders&quot; received its second lowest ratings on 17 May 2007, when 4.0 million viewers tuned in. This was also the lowest ever audience share, with just 19.6 per cent. This was attributed to a conflicting one-hour special episode of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on ITV1; however, ratings for the 10pm &quot;EastEnders&quot; repeat on BBC Three reached an all-time high of 1.4 million. Despite this, there have been times when &quot;EastEnders&quot; had higher ratings than &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, despite the two going head-to-head.

The ratings increased in 2010, thanks to the &quot;Who Killed Archie?&quot; storyline and second wedding of Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and the show&#x27;s first live episode on 19 February 2010. The live-episode averaged 15.6 million viewers, peaking at 16.6 million in the final five minutes of broadcast. In January 2010, the average audience was higher than that of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for the first time in three years. During the 30th anniversary week, in which there were live elements and the climax of the Who Killed Lucy Beale? storyline, 10.84 million viewers tuned in for the 30th anniversary episode itself in an hour long special on 19 February 2015 (peaking with 11.9 million). Later on in the same evening, a special flashback episode averaged 10.3 million viewers, and peaked with 11.2 million. The following day, the anniversary week was rounded off with another fully live episode (the second after 2010) with 9.97 million viewers watching the aftermath of the reveal, the Beale family finding out the truth of Lucy&#x27;s killer and deciding to keep it a secret. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the soap, &quot;EastEnders&quot; suffered a ratings drop after 2020. Despite once being the highest-rated soap, it dropped to third in the rankings in 2021, behind &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, with 4.09 million viewers. The BBC&#x27;s head of drama, Piers Wenger, explained that since the episode duration had been shortened and the airtime frequently suffered changes, it had led to the audience not knowing when to watch it. Digital Spy opined that the ratings drop was accredited to &quot;lacklustre storylines&quot; and thought that storylines on rival soaps were better. Later that year, &quot;EastEnders&quot; suffered its lowest rating ever, with 1.7 million viewers watching live. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s Jamie Roberts felt that viewers had &quot;turned their back&quot; on the soap due to its lack of interesting stories and iconic characters. Ratings expert Stephen Price also noted that the drop is partly due to the rise of streaming services.

== Criticism ==
&quot;EastEnders&quot; has received both praise and criticism for most of its storylines, which have dealt with difficult themes, such as violence, rape, murder and child abuse.

=== Initial response ===
The show&#x27;s first broadcast saw a mixed reaction from viewers. A &quot;Sunday People&quot; poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents did not enjoy the episode, as the audience were unsure about the show&#x27;s &quot;coarse&quot; and &quot;bawdy&quot; dialogue. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Hugh Herbert wrote that it would &quot;probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right&quot;. The show, regardless, became one of the BBC&#x27;s most successful shows of the 1980s, which was credited with the reveal that Den Watts was the father of Michelle Fowler&#x27;s baby. Following the first broadcast, the show was also criticised by Cockney viewers for lacking humour and realism.

=== Morality and violence ===
Mary Whitehouse, social critic, argued at the time that &quot;EastEnders&quot; represented a violation of &quot;family viewing time&quot; and that it undermined the watershed policy. She regarded &quot;EastEnders&quot; as a fundamental assault on the family and morality itself. She made reference to representation of family life and emphasis on psychological and emotional violence within the show. She was also critical of language such as &quot;bleeding&quot;, &quot;bloody hell&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot; and &quot;for Christ&#x27;s sake&quot;; however, Whitehouse also praised the programme, describing Michelle Fowler&#x27;s decision not to have an abortion as a &quot;very positive storyline&quot;. She also felt that &quot;EastEnders&quot; had been cleaned up as a result of her protests, though she later commented that &quot;EastEnders&quot; had returned to its old ways. Her criticisms were widely reported in the tabloid press as ammunition in its existing hostility towards the BBC. The stars of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in particular aligned themselves with Mary Whitehouse, gaining headlines such as &quot;STREETS AHEAD! RIVALS LASH SEEDY EASTENDERS&quot; and &quot;CLEAN UP SOAP! Street Star Bill Lashes &quot;Steamy&quot; EastEnders&quot;.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; has been criticised for being too violent, most notably during a domestic violence storyline between Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). As &quot;EastEnders&quot; is shown pre-watershed, there were worries that some scenes in this storyline were too graphic for its audience. Complaints against a scene in which Little Mo&#x27;s face was pushed in gravy on Christmas Day were upheld by the Broadcasting Standards Council; however, a helpline after this episode attracted over 2000 calls. Erin Pizzey, who became internationally famous for having started one of the first women&#x27;s refuges, said that &quot;EastEnders&quot; had done more to raise the issue of violence against women in one story than she had done in 25 years. The character of Phil Mitchell (played by Steve McFadden since early 1990) has been criticised on several occasions for glorifying violence and proving a bad role model to children. On one occasion following a scene in an episode broadcast in October 2002, where Phil brutally beat his godson, Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder), 31 complaints came from viewers.

In 2003, cast member Shaun Williamson, who was in the final months of his role of Barry Evans, said that the programme had become much grittier over the past 10 to 15 years, and found it &quot;frightening&quot; that parents let their young children watch.

In 2005, the BBC was accused of anti-religious bias by a House of Lords committee, who cited &quot;EastEnders&quot; as an example. Indarjit Singh, editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths, said: &quot;&quot;EastEnders&quot;″ Dot Cotton is an example. She quotes endlessly from the Bible and it ridicules religion to some extent.&quot; In July 2010, complaints were received following the storyline of Christian minister Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) committing a number of murders that he believed was his duty to God, claiming that the storyline was offensive to Christians.

In 2008, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, along with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, was criticised by Martin McGuinness, then Northern Ireland&#x27;s deputy first minister, for &quot;the level of concentration around the pub&quot; and the &quot;antics portrayed in The [...] Queen Vic&quot;.

In 2017, viewers complained on Twitter about scenes implying that Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) is the father of his 15-year-old sister Bernadette Taylor&#x27;s (Clair Norris) unborn baby, with the pair agreeing to keep the pregnancy secret from their mother, Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley); however, the baby&#x27;s father is revealed as one of Bernadette&#x27;s school friends.

=== Allegations of national and racial stereotypes ===
In 1997, several episodes were shot and set in Ireland, resulting in criticisms for portraying the Irish in a negatively stereotypical way. Ted Barrington, the Irish ambassador to the UK at the time, described the portrayal of Ireland as an &quot;unrepresentative caricature&quot;, stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation. Jana Bennett, the BBC&#x27;s then director of production, later apologised for the episodes, stating on BBC1&#x27;s news bulletin: &quot;It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence.&quot; A year later BBC chairman Christopher Bland admitted that as result of the Irish-set EastEnders episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.

In 2008, the show was criticised for stereotyping their Asian and Black characters, by having a black single mother, Denise Fox (Diane Parish), and an Asian shopkeeper, Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia). There has been criticism that the programme does not authentically portray the ethnic diversity of the population of East London, with the programme being &quot;twice as white&quot; as the real East End.

=== Controversial storylines ===
In 1992, writer David Yallop successfully sued the BBC for £68,000 after it was revealed he had been hired by producer Mike Gibbon in 1989 to pen several controversial storylines in an effort to &quot;slim down&quot; the cast; however, after Gibbon left the programme, executive producers chose not to use Yallop&#x27;s storylines, which put the BBC in breach of the contract Yallop had signed with them. Unused storylines penned by Yallop, which were revealed in the press during the trial, included the death of Cindy Beale&#x27;s (Michelle Collins) infant son Steven; Sufia Karim (Rani Singh) being killed during a shotgun raid at the corner shop; Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) dying of undiscovered cancer; and an IRA explosion at the Walford community centre, killing Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence), and leaving Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) paralysed below the waist. A suicide was also planned, but the character this storyline was assigned to was not revealed.

Some storylines have provoked high levels of viewer complaints. In August 2006, a scene involving Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley) and Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) having sex on the floor of Scarlet nightclub, and another scene involving Owen Turner (Lee Ross) violently attacking Denise Fox (Diane Parish), prompted 129 and 128 complaints, respectively.

In March 2008, scenes showing Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and boyfriend Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) burying Tanya&#x27;s husband Max (Jake Wood) alive attracted many complaints. The UK communications regulator Ofcom later found that the episodes depicting the storyline were in breach of the 2005 Broadcasting Code. They contravened the rules regarding protection of children by appropriate scheduling, appropriate depiction of violence before the 9 p.m. watershed and appropriate depiction of potentially offensive content. In September 2008, &quot;EastEnders&quot; began a grooming and paedophilia storyline involving characters Tony King (Chris Coghill), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) and Peter Beale (Thomas Law). The storyline attracted over 200 complaints.

In December 2010, Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) swapped her newborn baby, who died in cot, with Kat Moon&#x27;s (Jessie Wallace) living baby. Around 3,400 complaints were received, with viewers branding the storyline &quot;insensitive&quot;, &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;desperate&quot;. Roz Laws from the &quot;Sunday Mercury&quot; called the plot &quot;shocking and ridiculous&quot; and asked &quot;are we really supposed to believe that Kat won&#x27;t recognise that the baby looks different?&quot; The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (FSID) praised the storyline, and its director Joyce Epstein explained, &quot;We are very grateful to &quot;EastEnders&quot; for their accurate depiction of the devastating effect that the sudden death of an infant can have on a family. We hope that this story will help raise the public&#x27;s awareness of cot death, which claims 300 babies&#x27; lives each year.&quot; By 7 January, that storyline had generated the most complaints in show history: the BBC received about 8,500 complaints, and media regulator Ofcom received 374; however, despite the controversy, &quot;EastEnders&quot; pulled in rating highs of 9–10 million throughout the duration of the storyline.

In October 2014, the BBC defended a storyline, after receiving 278 complaints about 6 October 2014 episode where pub landlady Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) was raped by Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). On 17 November 2014 it was announced that Ofcom will investigate over the storyline. On 5 January 2015, the investigation was cleared by Ofcom. A spokesman of Ofcom said: &quot;After carefully investigating complaints about this scene, Ofcom found the BBC took appropriate steps to limit offence to viewers. This included a warning before the episode and implying the assault, rather than depicting it. Ofcom also took into account the programme&#x27;s role in presenting sometimes challenging or distressing social issues.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;EastEnders&quot; aired their first male rape scene which saw Lewis Butler (Aidan O&#x27;Callaghan) rape Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden). The BBC received complaints from viewers who were unhappy with the content in the episode. Viewers felt that the scenes were too violent and graphic for a pre-watershed time slot. The BBC responded by stating: &quot;&quot;EastEnders&quot; has been a pre-watershed BBC One staple for over 37 years and has a rich history of dealing with challenging and difficult issues and Ben&#x27;s story is one of these. We have worked closely with organisations and experts in the field to tell this story which we hope will raise awareness of sexual assaults and the issues surrounding them. We are always mindful of the timeslot in which &quot;EastEnders&quot; is shown and we took great care to signpost this storyline prior to transmission, through on-air continuity and publicity as well as providing a BBC Action Line at the end of the episode which offers advice and support to those affected by the issue&quot;.

=== Portrayal of certain professions ===
In 2010, &quot;EastEnders&quot; came under criticism from the police for the way that they were portrayed during the &quot;Who Killed Archie?&quot; storyline. During the storyline, DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) talk to locals about the case and Hughes accepts a bribe. The police claimed that such scenes were &quot;damaging&quot; to their reputation and added that the character DC Deanne Cunningham (Zoë Henry) was &quot;irritatingly inaccurate&quot;. In response to the criticism, &quot;EastEnders&quot; apologised for offending real life detectives and confirmed that it uses a police consultant for such storylines.

In October 2012, a storyline involving Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), forced to hand over her baby Lexi Pearce, was criticised by the charity The Who Cares? Trust, who called the storyline an &quot;unhelpful portrayal&quot; and said it had already received calls from members of the public who were &quot;distressed about the &quot;EastEnders&quot; scene where a social worker snatches a baby from its mother&#x27;s arms&quot;. The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC &quot;too lazy and arrogant&quot; to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken &quot;without sufficient grounds to do so&quot;. Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked &quot;real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs .. &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made a tough job even tougher.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
== In popular culture ==

Since its premiere in 1985, &quot;EastEnders&quot; has had a large impact on British popular culture. It has frequently been referred to in many different media, including songs and television programmes.

== Further reading ==

Many books have been written about &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Notably, from 1985 to 1988, author and television writer Hugh Miller wrote 17 novels, detailing the lives of many of the show&#x27;s original characters before 1985, when events on screen took place.

Kate Lock also wrote four novels centred on more recent characters; Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). Lock also wrote a character guide entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in EastEnders&quot; () in 2000, examining main characters from the first 15 years of the show.

Show creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland also wrote a book about the show in 1987, entitled &quot;EastEnders: The Inside Story&quot; (), telling the story of how the show made it to screen. Two special anniversary books have been written about the show; &quot;EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration&quot; () by Colin Brakein 1995 and &quot;EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square&quot; () by Rupert Smith in 2005.

<text>Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to stitch thread or yarn. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on hats, clothing, blankets, and handbags. Embroidery is available in a wide variety of thread or yarn colour. It is often used to personalize gifts or clothing items.

Some of the basic techniques or stitches of the earliest embroidery are chain stitch, buttonhole or blanket stitch, running stitch, satin stitch, and cross stitch. Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery. Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:

The art of embroidery has been found worldwide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the Warring States period (5th–3rd century BC). In a garment from Migration period Sweden, roughly 300–700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor&#x27;s buttonhole stitch, and Whip stitch, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.

=== Historical applications and techniques ===

Depending on time, location and materials available, embroidery could be the domain of a few experts or a widespread, popular technique. This flexibility led to a variety of works, from the royal to the mundane. Examples of high status items include elaborately embroidered clothing, religious objects, and household items often were seen as a mark of wealth and status. 

In medieval England, Opus Anglicanum, a technique used by professional workshops and guilds in medieval England, was used to embellish textiles used in church rituals. In 16th century England, some books, usually bibles or other religious texts, had embroidered bindings. The Bodleian Library in Oxford contains one presented to Queen Elizabeth I in 1583. It also owns a copy of The Epistles of Saint Paul, whose cover was reputedly embroidered by the Queen.

In 18th-century England and its colonies, with the rise of the merchant class and the wider availability of luxury materials, rich embroideries began to appear in a secular context. These embroideries took the form of items displayed in private homes of well-to-do citizens, as opposed to a church or royal setting. Even so, the embroideries themselves may still have had religious themes. Samplers employing fine silks were produced by the daughters of wealthy families. Embroidery was a skill marking a girl&#x27;s path into womanhood as well as conveying rank and social standing.

Embroidery was an important art and signified social status in the Medieval Islamic world as well. The 17th-century Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi called it the &quot;craft of the two hands&quot;. In cities such as Damascus, Cairo and Istanbul, embroidery was visible on handkerchiefs, uniforms, flags, calligraphy, shoes, robes, tunics, horse trappings, slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on leather belts. Craftsmen embroidered items with gold and silver thread. Embroidery cottage industries, some employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.

In the 16th century, in the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, his chronicler Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak wrote in the famous Ain-i-Akbari:
Conversely, embroidery is also a folk art, using materials that were accessible to nonprofessionals. Examples include Hardanger embroidery from Norway; Merezhka from Ukraine; Mountmellick embroidery from Ireland; Nakshi kantha from Bangladesh and West Bengal; Achachi from Peru; and Brazilian embroidery. Many techniques had a practical use such as Sashiko from Japan, which was used as a way to reinforce clothing.

While historically viewed as a pastime, activity, or hobby, intended just for women, embroidery has often been used as a form of biography. Women who were unable to access a formal education or, at times, writing implements, were often taught embroidery and utilized it as a means of documenting their lives by telling stories through their embroidery. In terms of documenting the histories of marginalized groups, especially women of color both within the United States and around the world, embroidery is a means of studying the everyday lives of those whose lives largely went unstudied throughout much of history.

=== 21st century ===

Since the late 2010s, there has been a growth in the popularity of embroidering by hand. As a result of visual social media such as Pinterest and Instagram, artists can share their work more extensively, which has inspired younger generations to pick up needlework. 

Contemporary embroidery artists believe hand embroidery has grown in popularity as a result of an increasing need for relaxation and digitally disconnecting practices. Many people are also using embroidery to creatively upcycle and repair clothing, to help counteract over-consumption and fashion industry waste.

Modern hand embroidery, as opposed to cross-stitching, is characterized by a more &quot;liberal&quot; approach, where stitches are more freely combined in unconventional ways to create various textures and designs.

Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use of a wide range of stitching patterns in a single piece of work.

=== Climate crisis ===
Training women in traditional embroidery skills in Inner Mongolia, was begun by Bai Jingying as a reaction to the financial pressures caused by the impact of climate change, including desertification, in the region.

== Classification ==

Embroidery can be classified according to what degree the design takes into account the nature of the base material and by the relationship of stitch placement to the fabric. The main categories are free or surface embroidery, counted-thread embroidery, and needlepoint or canvas work.

In free or surface embroidery, designs are applied without regard to the weave of the underlying fabric. Examples include crewel and traditional Chinese and Japanese embroidery.

Counted-thread embroidery patterns are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric. Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an even-weave foundation fabric such as embroidery canvas, aida cloth, or specially woven cotton and linen fabrics. Examples include cross-stitch and some forms of blackwork embroidery.

While similar to counted thread in regards to technique, in canvas work or needlepoint, threads are stitched through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric. Examples of canvas work include bargello and Berlin wool work.

Embroidery can also be classified by the similarity of its appearance. In drawn thread work and cutwork, the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in the same color as the foundation fabric. When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as whitework. However, whitework can either be counted or free. Hardanger embroidery is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric. Conversely, styles such as Broderie anglaise are similar to free embroidery, with floral or abstract designs that are not dependent on the weave of the fabric.

==Traditional hand embroidery around the world==

== Materials and tools ==
=== Materials ===
The fabrics and yarns used in traditional embroidery vary from place to place. Wool, linen, and silk have been in use for thousands of years for both fabric and yarn. Today, embroidery thread is manufactured in cotton, rayon, and novelty yarns as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk. Ribbon embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/organza blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.

Surface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and couching or laid-work are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for goldwork. Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried on the back of the work, use more materials but provide a sturdier and more substantial finished textile.

=== Tools ===

A needle is the main stitching tool in embroidery, and comes in various sizes and types.

In both canvas work and surface embroidery an embroidery hoop or frame can be used to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion.

== Machine embroidery ==
The development of machine embroidery and its mass production came about in stages during the Industrial Revolution. The first embroidery machine was the hand embroidery machine, invented in France in 1832 by Josué Heilmann. The next evolutionary step was the schiffli embroidery machine. The latter borrowed from the sewing machine and the Jacquard loom to fully automate its operation. The manufacture of machine-made embroideries in St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland flourished in the latter half of the 19th century. Both St. Gallen, Switzerland and Plauen, Germany were important centers for machine embroidery and embroidery machine development. Many Swiss and Germans immigrated to Hudson county, New Jersey in the early twentieth century and developed a machine embroidery industry there. Shiffli machines have continued to evolve and are still used for industrial scale embroidery.

Contemporary embroidery is stitched with a computerized embroidery machine using patterns digitized with embroidery software. In machine embroidery, different types of &quot;fills&quot; add texture and design to the finished work. Machine embroidery is used to add logos and monograms to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household items for the bed and bath and other linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.

Machine embroidery is most typically done with rayon thread, although polyester thread can also be used. Cotton thread, on the other hand, is prone to breaking and is avoided.

There has also been a development in free hand machine embroidery, new machines have been designed that allow for the user to create free-motion embroidery which has its place in textile arts, quilting, dressmaking, home furnishings and more. Users can use the embroidery software to digitize the digital embroidery designs. These digitized design are then transferred to the embroidery machine with the help of a flash drive and then the embroidery machine embroiders the selected design onto the fabric.

== In literature ==
In Greek mythology the goddess Athena is said to have passed down the art of embroidery (along with weaving) to humans, leading to the famed competition between herself and the mortal Arachne.

<text>Edward Mitchell Bannister (November 2, 1828January 9, 1901) was a Canadian–American oil painter of the American Barbizon school. Born in colonial New Brunswick, he spent his adult life in New England in the United States. There, along with his wife Christiana Carteaux, he was a prominent member of African-American cultural and political communities, such as the Boston abolition movement. Bannister received national recognition after he won a first prize in painting at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. He was also a founding member of the Providence Art Club and the Rhode Island School of Design.

Bannister&#x27;s style and predominantly pastoral subject matter reflected his admiration for the French artist Jean-François Millet and the French Barbizon school. A lifelong sailor, he also looked to the Rhode Island seaside for inspiration. Bannister continually experimented, and his artwork displays his Idealist philosophy and his control of color and atmosphere. He began his professional practice as a photographer and portraitist before developing his better-known landscape style.

Later in his life, Bannister&#x27;s style of landscape painting fell out of favor. With decreasing painting sales, he and Christiana Carteaux moved out of College Hill in Providence to Boston and then a smaller house on Wilson Street in Providence. Bannister was overlooked in American art historical studies and exhibitions after his death in 1901, until institutions like the National Museum of African Art returned him to national attention in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bannister was born on November 2, 1828, in Saint Andrews, a settlement in the Colony of New Brunswick near the St. Croix River. His father, Edward Bannister, was born in Barbados. His mother, Hannah Bannister (), was also born in colonial New Brunswick, according to Bannister, &quot;a stone&#x27;s throw of my birthplace on the banks of the St. Croix River.&quot; Hannah&#x27;s parents were probably from Barbados. Although both of his parents were black, Bannister was sometimes identified as &quot;Mulatto.&quot; At the time, this designation was based on skin color as perceived by the Census taker, and did not reflect self-identity or family history. Bannister&#x27;s father died in 1832, so Edward and his younger brother William were raised by their mother. Early on, Bannister was apprenticed to a cobbler, but his drawing skill was already noted among his friends and family. Bannister credited his mother with igniting his early interest in art. She died in 1844, after which Bannister and his brother lived on the farm of the wealthy lawyer and merchant Harris Hatch. There, he practiced drawing by reproducing Hatch family portraits and copying British engravings in the family library.

Bannister and his brother found work aboard ships as mates and cooks for several months before immigrating to Boston, sometime in the late 1840s. In the 1850 US census, they are listed as living at the same boarding house, with the Revaleon family, and working as barbers. The brothers&#x27; role as barbers and status as mixed race gave them relatively high standing as middle-class professionals within Boston.

Although he aspired to work as a painter, Bannister had difficulty finding an apprenticeship or academic programs that would accept him, due to racial prejudice. Boston was an abolitionist stronghold, but it was also one of the most segregated cities in the US in 1860. Bannister would later express his frustration with being blocked from artistic education: &quot;Whatever may be my success as an artist is due more to inherited potential than to instruction&quot; and &quot;All I would do I cannot... simply for the want of proper training.&quot;
Bannister received his first oil painting commission, &quot;The Ship Outward Bound&quot;, in 1854 from an African American doctor, John V. DeGrasse. Jacob R. Andrews, a gilder, painter, and member of the Histrionic Club, created the commission&#x27;s gilt frame. DeGrasse later commissioned Bannister to paint portraits of him and his wife. Patronage like DeGrasse&#x27;s was critical to Bannister&#x27;s early career, as the African American community wanted to support and highlight its contributions to high culture. African Americans found portraiture an &quot;ideal medium&quot; for expressing their freedom and opportunity, which is probably why most of Bannister&#x27;s earliest commissions are within that genre.

Through abolitionist newspapers like &quot;The Anglo-African&quot; and &quot;The Liberator&quot; and the writings of Martin R. Delany, Bannister likely learned about other African American artists like Robert S. Duncanson, James Presley Ball, Patrick H. Reason, and David Bustill Bowser. Their work would have made Bannister&#x27;s ambition seem all the more possible. Although most cultural institutions barred Black Bostonians from entrance, Bannister would have had access to several, like the Boston Athenæum library, with collections of European art sources and exhibitions of Luminist marine painters like Robert Salmon and Fitz Hugh Lane.

===Boston activist, artist, and student===

Bannister met Christiana Carteaux, a hairdresser and businesswoman born in Rhode Island to African American and Narragansett parents, in 1853 when he applied to be a barber in her salon. Both were members of Boston&#x27;s diverse abolitionist movement, and barbershops were important meeting places for African American abolitionists. They married on June 10, 1857, and she became, in effect, his most important patron. The couple boarded for two years with Lewis Hayden and Harriet Bell Hayden at 66 Southac Street, a stop on Boston&#x27;s Underground Railroad (a support network for escaped slaves).

In 1855 William Cooper Nell acknowledged Bannister&#x27;s rising artistic status in &quot;The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution&quot; for his &quot;The Ship Outward Bound&quot;. Bannister also received encouragement to continue painting from artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter. By 1858, Bannister was listed as an artist in Boston&#x27;s city directory. Around 1862, he spent a year training in photography in New York, likely to support his painting practice. He then found work as a photographer, taking solar plates and tinting photos. One of Bannister&#x27;s earliest commissioned portraits was of Prudence Nelson Bell in 1864, which is around when he found studio space at the Studio Building in Boston. At the Studio Building, he came into contact with other prominent artists, like Elihu Vedder and John La Farge. Once Bannister was established as an artist, abolitionist William Wells Brown praised him in a 1865 book:
Bannister was part of Boston&#x27;s African American artistic community, which included Edmonia Lewis, William H. Simpson, and Nelson A. Primus. He sang as a tenor in the Crispus Attucks Choir, which performed anti-slavery songs at public events, and acted with the Histrionic Club, as well as serving as a delegate for the New England Colored Citizens Conventions in August 1859 and 1865. His name also appears on several public petitions published in &quot;The Liberator&quot;.
Bannister and Carteaux were devout members of the militant abolitionist Twelfth Baptist Church, located on Southac Street near their home at the Hayden House. In May 1859, Bannister served as the secretary for the church&#x27;s meetings to respond to the Oberlin–Wellington Rescue of imprisoned fugitive slaves and, in 1863, to plan celebrations for the Emancipation Proclamation.

During the US Civil War, Carteaux lobbied for equal pay for African American soldiers and organized the 1864 soldiers&#x27; relief fair for the Massachusetts 54th infantry regiment, 55th infantry regiment, and 5th cavalry regiment, which had gone without pay for over a year and a half. Bannister donated his full-length portrait of Robert Gould Shaw, the commander of the 54th killed in action, to raise money for the cause. Bannister&#x27;s portrait of Gould Shaw was displayed with the label &quot;&quot;Our&quot; Martyr&quot;, according to abolitionist Lydia Maria Child. The portrait was praised in the &quot;New York Weekly Anglo-African&quot; as &quot;a fine specimen of art&quot; and inspired a poem by Martha Perry Lowe entitled &quot;The Picture of Col. Shaw in Boston&quot;. The painting was purchased by the state of Massachusetts and installed in its state house, but its current location is unknown.

The Bannister portrait of Robert Gould Shaw was one of several memorials to Gould Shaw by members of Boston&#x27;s African American artistic community such as Edmonia Lewis. These artworks, put to the practical purpose of raising money for Black soldiers, contradicted the ideals of Boston Brahmin abolitionists, such as the Gould Shaws. Although the Brahmins supported abolition, they saw it as an abstract good rather than a concrete cause in need of material support. The portrait&#x27;s paternalistic praise from Lowe and Child exemplified the divide between Boston&#x27;s white abolitionists and the African American community. Through art like the 1884 Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, the Boston Brahmins rejected the possessive &quot;Our Martyr&quot; label given to him by Black artists like Bannister and Edmonia Lewis.

Bannister&#x27;s activism also took other forms: on June 17, 1865, Bannister marshaled around two hundred members of the Twelfth Baptist Sunday School at a Grand Temperance Celebration on Boston Common. They marched under a banner reading &quot;Equal rights for all men&quot;.

Bannister eventually studied at the Lowell Institute with the artist William Rimmer, while Rimmer taught evening life drawing classes at the Institute between 1863 and 1865. Rimmer was known for his skill in artistic anatomy, an area Bannister knew was one of his weaknesses. Because of Bannister&#x27;s daytime photography business, he mostly took his drawing classes at night. Through Rimmer and the community at the Studio Building, Bannister was inspired by the Barbizon School-influenced paintings of William Morris Hunt, who had studied in Europe and held public exhibitions in Boston around the 1860s. At the Lowell Institute, Bannister formed a lifelong friendship with painter John Nelson Arnold; both later became founding members of the Providence Art Club. Bannister also formed a temporary painting partnership with Asa R. Lewis that lasted from 1868 to 1869. During that partnership of &quot;Bannister &amp; Lewis&quot;, Bannister began to advertise himself as both a portrait and landscape painter.

Despite his early commissions, Bannister still struggled to receive wider recognition for his work due to racism in the US. Following emancipation and the end of the US Civil War, the abolitionists began to disperse and, with them, their patronage. Due to increasing competition, Bannister did little to support Primus, who had come to him seeking an apprenticeship. An article in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; belittled both Bannister and his work: &quot;The negro has an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it.&quot; The article reportedly spurred his desire to achieve success as an artist. At the same time, Bannister had begun to receive more recognition within Boston art circles.

===Providence===
Supported by Carteaux, Bannister became a full-time painter in 1870, shortly after they moved to Providence, Rhode Island, at the end of 1869. He first took a studio in the Mercantile National Bank Building then moved to the Woods Building in Providence, where he shared a floor with artists like Sydney Burleigh and became friends with Providence painter George William Whitaker. He painted more landscapes over timereceiving an 1872 award at the Rhode Island Industrial Exposition for &quot;Summer Afternoon&quot;and began submitting paintings to the Boston Art Club.

Bannister received national commendation for his work when he won first prize for his large oil &quot;Under the Oaks&quot; at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial.
Even then, the judge wanted to rescind the award after learning his identity until other exhibition artists protested; afterwards, Bannister reflected: &quot;I was and am proud to know that the jury of award did not know anything about me, my antecedents, color or race. There was no sentimental sympathy leading to the award of the medal.&quot; Bannister had intentionally submitted his painting with only a signature attached to ensure he would be judged fairly. As his career matured, he received more commissions and accumulated many honors, several from the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association (silver medals in 1881 and 1884). Collectors and local notables Isaac Comstock Bates and Joseph Ely were among his patrons.

He was an original board member of the Rhode Island School of Design in 1878. In 1880 Bannister joined with other professional artists, amateurs, and art collectors to found the Providence Art Club to stimulate the appreciation of art in the community. Their first meeting was in Bannister&#x27;s studio in the Woods Building at the bottom of College Hill. He was the second to sign the club&#x27;s charter, served on its initial executive board, and taught regular Saturday art classes. He continued to show paintings at Boston Art Club exhibitions, as well as in Connecticut and at New York&#x27;s National Academy of Design, and exhibited &quot;A New England Hillside&quot; at the New Orleans Cotton Exposition in 1885. There, Bannister&#x27;s work was segregated and ignored by the judging committees. With that experience in mind, Bannister decided not to submit any works to the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition since they would have to be pre-judged in Boston before they could even be sent to Chicago.

In the 1880s Bannister bought a small sloop, the &quot;Fanchon&quot;, and spent summers sketching, painting watercolors, and sailing Narragansett Bay and up to Bar Harbor in Maine. He would return with his studies and use them as the basis for winter commissions. He supplemented his sailing trips with journeys to exhibitions in New York, but a planned trip to Europe fell through due to lack of money.

In 1885, with other art club members, Bannister helped found the Anne Eliza Club (or &quot;A&amp;E Club&quot;)a communal men&#x27;s discussion group named after the waitress at the Providence Art Club. Through his teaching there and at the Providence Art Club, he became a mentor to younger Providence artists, like Charles Walter Stetson. Stetson often mentioned Bannister in his personal diaries and once praised him by writing, &quot;He is my only confidant in Art matters &amp; I am his.&quot; Rhode Island engineer George Henry Corliss commissioned a painting from Bannister in 1886, as his reputation grew.
Bannister and Carteaux were consistent members of the African American community in Providence. They lived for a time in the boarding house of Ransom Parker, who had participated in the Dorr Rebellion, and were friends with merchant George Henry, Reverend Mahlon Van Horne, Brown graduate John Hope, and abolitionist George T. Downing, an ally from the Bannisters&#x27; political work in Boston. Carteaux founded the Home for Aged Colored Women, which is known as the Bannister Center today. Edward exhibited his painting &quot;Christ Healing the Sick&quot; in the home in 1892 and donated his portrait of Carteaux to it as well. Although he was a respected member of the Providence Art Club, Bannister&#x27;s abolitionism likely led to conflict with its mostly white members, who exhibited art with minstrel stereotypes by E. W. Kemble and W. L. Shephard in 1887 and 1893.

Around 1890, Bannister sold the &quot;Fanchon&quot; to Judge George Newman Bliss. His largest exhibition of works was held in 1891, when he showed 33 works at the Spring Providence Art Club Exhibition. Later in the 1890s, Bannister seems to have sold fewer paintings, perhaps due to waning popularity, and exhibited less often. In 1898 Bannister closed his studio and the couple moved to Boston for a year before returning to a smaller home on Wilson Street, Providence, in 1900.

===Death===
Bannister died of a heart attack on January 9, 1901, while attending an evening prayer meeting at his church, Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. He had experienced heart trouble for some time but had completed two paintings only the previous day. During the service, he offered a prayer and shortly after sat down, gasping. His last words were reportedly &quot;Jesus, help me&quot;.

After his death the Providence Art Club held a memorial exhibition in his name that focused on his artistic achievements, without mentioning his contribution to abolitionism. In the exhibition pamphlet, they wrote: &quot;His gentle disposition, his urbanity of manner, and his generous appreciation of the work of others, made him a welcome guest in all artistic circles. [...] He painted with profound feeling, not for pecuniary results, but to leave upon the canvas his impression of natural scenery, and to express his delight in the wondrous beauty of land and sea and sky.&quot;

He is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, under a stone monument designed by artist Mahler B. Ryder, RISD Illustration professor, and colleagues. In 1975, upon finding Bannister&#x27;s marker damaged beyond repair, Ryder led a fundraising and design campaign to create a new monument, which stands today. The original marker was placed by Bannister&#x27;s friends upon his death. The disparity between Bannister&#x27;s financial difficulties at the end of his life and the support shown by Providence&#x27;s artists after his death led his friend John Nelson Arnold to say about the memorial: &quot;In the labor incident to this work I was constantly reminded of the remark attributed to the mother of Robert Burns on being shown the splendid monument erected to the memory of her gifted son: &#x27;He asked for bread and they gave him a stone.&#x27;&quot;.

Carteaux was admitted to her Home for Aged Colored Women in September 1902; she died in 1903 in a state mental institution in Cranston. She and Bannister are buried together.

==Artistic style==

The young Bannister advertised himself as a portraitist, but later became popular for his landscapes and seascapes. Drawing on his knowledge of poetry, classics, and English literature as an autodidact, he also painted biblical, mythological, and genre scenes. Much like George Inness, his work reflected the composition, mood, and influences of French Barbizon painters Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Jean-François Millet, and Charles-François Daubigny. Defending Millet in &quot;The Artist and His Critics&quot;, Bannister saw him as the most &quot;spiritual artist of our time&quot; who voiced &quot;the sad, uncomplaining life he saw about himand with which he sympathized so deeply.&quot;

Historian Joseph Skerrett has noted the influence of the Hudson River School on Bannister, while maintaining that he consistently experimented throughout his career: &quot;Bannister managed to please a conservative New England taste in art while continuing to try new methods and styles.&quot; For their mutual affinity with the Hudson River School, Bannister has been compared to his contemporary, the Ohio-based African American painter Robert S. Duncanson. Unlike Hudson River School artists, Bannister did not create meticulous landscapes but paid more attention to creating &quot;massive but revealing shapes of trees and mountains&quot; and works more picturesque than sublime. Bannister also avoided the &quot;nationalist grandeur&quot; often found in Hudson River School paintings.
Bannister often made pencil or pastel studies in preparation for larger oil paintings. Several of his compositions refer to classical, mathematical methods like the Golden Ratio or &quot;Harmonic Grid&quot;, and make careful use of symmetry and asymmetry. In other paintings, his contrast of darks and lights create dynamic diagonals or circles that divide the composition. His paintings are known for their delicate use of color to depict shadow and atmosphere and their loose brushwork. His later palette exhibited lighter, more muted colors: the Boston Common scene he painted late in his life is a notable example. This change in style stands in contrast to his earlier stated disapproval of Impressionist painting.

Art historian Traci Lee Costa has argued that a &quot;reductive&quot; emphasis on Bannister&#x27;s biography has taken attention away from scholarly analysis of his artwork. In the lecture &quot;The Artist and His Critics&quot; given to the Anne Eliza Club on April 15, 1886, and published afterward, Bannister spelled out his belief that making art is a highly spiritual practicethe pinnacle of human achievement. In its nearly religious approach and focus on subjective representations of nature, Bannister&#x27;s philosophy has been compared to both German Idealism and American Transcendentalism. In his lecture, Bannister referenced the works of American Transcendentalist Washington Allston. Bannister&#x27;s friend George W. Whitaker referred to him as &quot;The Idealist&quot; in a 1914 article &quot;Reminiscences of Providence Artists&quot;. The lecture and its idealistic view are linked to Bannister&#x27;s &quot;Approaching Storm&quot; (see right), which he completed in the same year. &quot;Approaching Storm&quot; features a human figure at its center, which is nonetheless rendered small by the surrounding landscape. Despite the implied drama, Bannister used a cool color palette of blues and greens, with contrasting yellows that provide warmth against the darker, almost purple sky. The contrast of melancholy elements against more cheerful pastoral themes appears in many of Bannister&#x27;s paintings.

Although committed to freedom and equal rights for African Americans, Bannister did not often directly represent those issues in his paintings. The farms that Bannister painted were reminders of southern Rhode Island&#x27;s history of chattel slavery, unlike French Barbizon scenes. In &quot;Hay Gatherers&quot;, Bannister depicts African American field laborers in a rural landscape. Unlike Bannister&#x27;s idyllic pastorals, &quot;Hay Gatherers&quot; represents racial oppression and labor exploitation in Rhode Island, particularly South County where most of the state&#x27;s plantations were. The women workers are separated from the field of wildflowers at the painting&#x27;s lower left and other field workers in the background by stands of trees, suggesting their closeness to freedom even while they are still within the grasp of plantation labor. Through the geometric composition of &quot;Hay Gatherers&quot;, which divides the figures and the landscapes into triangular sections, Bannister combined his work on seemingly idealized landscapes with his earlier political art, visible in his humanist portraits such as &quot;Newspaper Boy&quot;. Bannister&#x27;s &quot;Fort Dumpling, Jamestown, Rhode Island&quot; uses a similar triangular composition, whereby people relaxing are juxtaposed against but separated from sailboats in the background, a reminder of the &quot;maritime legacy of slavery&quot;.
Bannister often conveyed political meaning in his paintings through allegory and allusion. One of his first commissions, &quot;The Ship Outward Bound&quot;, might have been a veiled reference to the forced return of Anthony Burns to slavery and Virginia under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 in 1854. In African American culture, an image of a ship leaving harbor was a reminder of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Bannister&#x27;s 1885 drawing &quot;The Woodsman&quot; is thought to be Bannister&#x27;s response to the murder of Amasa Sprague, an event that spurred the abolition of capital punishment in Rhode Island after the dubious conviction and hanging of John Gordon. Similarly, his &quot;Governor Sprague&#x27;s White Horse&quot; depicted the horse that William Sprague IV rode into the First Battle of Bull Run.

Bannister has been criticized for not often directly representing African Americans, outside of his early portraiture. He and artists like Henry Ossawa Tanner were deemed inauthentic during the Harlem Renaissance for producing works that appealed to white aesthetics. Many of Bannister&#x27;s works were commissioned landscapes and portraits that reinforced European ideas, even though his art subtly dismantled racial stereotypes. In that way, Bannister has been compared to later Bostonian poet William Stanley Braithwaite, whose writing did not clearly reflect his identity. Bannister&#x27;s work reflected his desire to excel and contribute to racial uplift, while still needing to depend on white patronage to reach a wider audience. Art historian Juanita Holland wrote of Bannister&#x27;s dilemma: &quot;This was a large part of the double bind that [Boston&#x27;s] black artists faced: they needed to both address and represent an African American identity, while finding a way for their white viewers to look past race to a perception of the work in more universal terms.&quot;

==Legacy==
Bannister was the only major African American artist of the late nineteenth century who developed his talents without European exposure; he was well known in the artistic community of Providence and admired within the wider East Coast art world. After his death, he was largely forgotten by art history for almost a century, principally due to racial prejudice. His art was often omitted from 20th-century art histories, and his style of melancholic, serene landscapes also fell out of fashion. Still, he and his paintings are an indelible part of a refigured relationship between African American culture and the landscapes of Reconstruction-era America.

Bannister&#x27;s art continued to be supported by galleries like the Barnett-Aden Gallery and the Art Institute of Chicago. Following the civil rights movement in the 1960s, his work was again celebrated and widely collected. In collaboration with the Rhode Island School of Design and the Frederick Douglass Institute, the National Museum of African Art held an exhibition titled &quot;Edward Mitchell Bannister, 1828–1901: Providence Artist&quot; in 1973. The Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame inducted Bannister in 1976, and Rhode Island College created the Bannister Gallery in 1978 with an inaugural exhibition &quot;Four from Providence : Bannister, Prophet, Alston, Jennings&quot;.

The New York-based Kenkebala Gallery held two exhibitions of Bannister&#x27;s work, one in 1992 curated by Corrinne Jennings in collaboration with the Whitney and one in 2001 on the centennial of Bannister&#x27;s death. From June 9 to October 8, 2018, the Gilbert Stuart Museum held an exhibition honoring Bannister and Carteaux&#x27;s relationship, &quot;&quot;My Greatest Successes Have Come Through Her&quot;: The Artistic Partnership of Edward and Christiana Bannister&quot;, as part of its Rhode Island Masters exhibition series. Bannister&#x27;s portrait of Christiana Carteaux was the center of the exhibition.

In September 2017, a Providence City Council committee unanimously voted to rename Magee Street (which had been named after a Rhode Island slave trader) to Bannister Street, in honor of Edward and Christiana Bannister. The Providence Art Club unveiled a bronze bust of Bannister made by Providence artist Gage Prentiss in May 2021. As of 2018, art historian Anne Louise Avery is compiling the first catalogue raisonné and a major biography of Bannister&#x27;s work.

In September 2023, a bronze sculpture of Bannister by artist Gage Prentiss was unveiled in Providence&#x27;s Market Square. Bannister is depicted in life size, sitting on a bench.

==House==
In 1884 Bannister and Carteaux moved from the boarding house of Ransom Parker to 93 Benevolent Street, and lived there until 1899. The two-and-a-half-story wooden house was built circa 1854 by engineer Charles E. Paine and is now known as &quot;The Vault&quot; or &quot;The Bannister House&quot;. Euchlin Reeves and Louise Herreshoff purchased the house in the late 1930s and renovated it to add a brick exterior. The renovation was made to create consistency with their next-door property, so both houses could hold their &quot;little museum&quot; of antiques. Herreshoff died in 1967 and the porcelain collection filling the Bannister House was donated to Washington and Lee University.

The house is now listed as contributing to College Hill&#x27;s historical designation. Brown University bought the property in 1989 and used it to store refrigerators. Due to a lack of plans for its preservation and use, the Providence Preservation Society put the Bannister House on its 2001 list of most endangered buildings in Providence. Brown University president Ruth Simmons assured historian and former Rhode Island deputy secretary of state Ray Rickman that the house would be preserved, although the university debated whether to sell the house to a third party.

Because its disrepair and long disuse made the house unsuitable for residence, Brown renovated the property in 2015 and restored it to its original appearance. It was sold in 2016 as part of the Brown to Brown Home Ownership Programthe program specifies that if the house is ever sold, it has to be sold back to the university.

<doc id="10002" wikidata="Q76828" url="?curid=10002" title="Emil Kraepelin">
<text>Emil Wilhelm Georg Magnus Kraepelin (; ; 15 February 1856 – 7 October 1926) was a German psychiatrist. H. J. Eysenck&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Psychology identifies him as the founder of modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology and psychiatric genetics.

Kraepelin believed the chief origin of psychiatric disease to be biological and genetic malfunction. His theories dominated psychiatry at the start of the 20th century and, despite the later psychodynamic influence of Sigmund Freud and his disciples, enjoyed a revival at century&#x27;s end. While he proclaimed his own high clinical standards of gathering information &quot;by means of expert analysis of individual cases&quot;, he also drew on reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry.

His textbooks do not contain detailed case histories of individuals but mosaic-like compilations of typical statements and behaviors from patients with a specific diagnosis. He has been described as &quot;a scientific manager&quot; and &quot;a political operator&quot;, who developed &quot;a large-scale, clinically oriented, epidemiological research programme&quot;. He developed racist psychiatric theories.

== Family and early life ==
Kraepelin, whose father, Karl Wilhelm, was a former opera singer, music teacher, and later successful story teller, was born in 1856 in Neustrelitz, in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Germany. He was first introduced to biology by his brother Karl, 10 years older and, later, the director of the Zoological Museum of Hamburg.

==Education and career==

Kraepelin began his medical studies in 1874 at the University of Leipzig and completed them at the University of Würzburg (1877–78). At Leipzig, he studied neuropathology under Paul Flechsig and experimental psychology with Wilhelm Wundt. Kraepelin would be a disciple of Wundt and had a lifelong interest in experimental psychology based on his theories. While there, Kraepelin wrote a prize-winning essay, &quot;The Influence of Acute Illness in the Causation of Mental Disorders&quot;.

At Würzburg he completed his &quot;Rigorosum&quot; (roughly equivalent to a PhD level viva-voce examination, literally &quot;rigorous exam&quot;) in March 1878, his &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; (licensing examination) in July 1878, and his &quot;Approbation&quot; (his license to practice medicine; roughly equivalent to an MBBS) on 9 August 1878. From August 1878 to 1882, he worked with Bernhard von Gudden at the University of Munich.

Returning to the University of Leipzig in February 1882, he worked in Wilhelm Heinrich Erb&#x27;s neurology clinic and in Wundt&#x27;s psychopharmacology laboratory. He completed his &quot;habilitation&quot; thesis - major postdoc publication and process - at Leipzig; it was entitled &quot;The Place of Psychology in Psychiatry&quot;. On 3 December 1883 he completed his &quot;umhabilitation&quot; (&quot;habilitation&quot; at another institution than originally applied for = habilitation recognition procedure) at Munich.

Kraepelin&#x27;s major work, &quot;Compendium der Psychiatrie: Zum Gebrauche für Studirende und Aerzte&quot; (&quot;Compendium of Psychiatry: For the Use of Students and Physicians&quot;), was first published in 1883 and was expanded in subsequent multivolume editions to &quot;Ein Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie&quot; (&quot;A Textbook: Foundations of Psychiatry and Neuroscience&quot;). In it, he argued that psychiatry was a branch of medical science and should be investigated by observation and experimentation like the other natural sciences. He called for research into the physical causes of mental illness, and started to establish the foundations of the modern classification system for mental disorders. Kraepelin proposed that by studying case histories and identifying specific disorders, the progression of mental illness could be predicted, after taking into account individual differences in personality and patient age at the onset of disease.

In 1884, he became senior physician in the Prussian provincial town of Leubus, Silesia Province, and the following year he was appointed director of the Treatment and Nursing Institute in Dresden. On 1 July 1886, at the age of 30, Kraepelin was named Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Dorpat (today the University of Tartu) in what is today Tartu, Estonia (see Burgmair et al., vol. IV). Four years later, on 5 December 1890, he became department head at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained until 1904. While at Dorpat he became the director of the 80-bed University Clinic, where he began to study and record many clinical histories in detail and &quot;was led to consider the importance of the course of the illness with regard to the classification of mental disorders&quot;.

In 1903, Kraepelin moved to Munich to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Munich.

In 1908, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 1912, at the request of the DVP (Deutscher Verein für Psychiatrie; German Association for Psychiatry), of which he was the head from 1906 to 1920, he began plans to establish a centre for research. Following a large donation from the Jewish German-American banker James Loeb, who had at one time been a patient, and promises of support from &quot;patrons of science&quot;, the German Institute for Psychiatric Research was founded in 1917 in Munich. Initially housed in existing hospital buildings, it was maintained by further donations from Loeb and his relatives. In 1924 it came under the auspices of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science. The German-American Rockefeller family&#x27;s Rockefeller Foundation made a large donation enabling the development of a new dedicated building for the institute along Kraepelin&#x27;s guidelines, which was officially opened in 1928.

Kraepelin spoke out against the barbarous treatment that was prevalent in the psychiatric asylums of the time, and crusaded against alcohol, capital punishment and the imprisonment rather than treatment of the insane. For the sedation of agitated patients, Kraepelin recommended potassium bromide. He rejected psychoanalytical theories that posited innate or early sexuality as the cause of mental illness, and he rejected philosophical speculation as unscientific. He focused on collecting clinical data and was particularly interested in neuropathology (e.g., diseased tissue).

He also firmly rejected the assumption of natural difference in relation to homosexuality, which he regarded as a vice caused by masturbation. In 1918 he called for &quot;educational discipline&quot; such as those introduced by the Nazi party after 1933: severe punishments for the crime of &#x27;corruption&#x27; (seduction), applicable to any act related to sexual gratification. This extended the anti-gay policy of the time, which only punished sexual intercourse between men. These ideas eventually went on to lend legitimacy to Nazi policies that persecuted gay people, allowing the Nazi party to do so under the guise of conforming to scientific opinions. His work legitimized the persecution and inhumane treatment of gay people in Nazi Germany.

In the later period of his career, as a convinced champion of social Darwinism, he actively promoted a policy and research agenda in racial hygiene and eugenics.

Kraepelin retired from teaching at the age of 66, spending his remaining years establishing the institute. The ninth and final edition of his &quot;Textbook&quot; was published in 1927, shortly after his death. It comprised four volumes and was ten times larger than the first edition of 1883.

In the last years of his life, Kraepelin was preoccupied with Buddhist teachings and was planning to visit Buddhist shrines at the time of his death, according to his daughter, Antonie Schmidt-Kraepelin.

== Theories and classification schemes ==
Kraepelin announced that he had found a new way of looking at mental illness, referring to the traditional view as &quot;symptomatic&quot; and to his view as &quot;clinical&quot;. This turned out to be his paradigm-setting synthesis of the hundreds of mental disorders classified by the 19th century, grouping diseases together based on classification of syndrome—common &quot;patterns&quot; of symptoms over time—rather than by simple similarity of major symptoms in the manner of his predecessors.

Kraepelin described his work in the 5th edition of his textbook as a &quot;decisive step from a symptomatic to a clinical view of insanity. . . . The importance of external clinical signs has . . . been subordinated to consideration of the conditions of origin, the course, and the terminus which result from individual disorders. Thus, all purely symptomatic categories have disappeared from the nosology&quot;.

=== Psychosis and mood ===
Kraepelin is specifically credited with the classification of what was previously considered to be a unitary concept of psychosis, into two distinct forms (known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy):

* manic depression (although commonly presented as synonym with bipolar disorder that is inaccurate; manic depressive illness encompasses a broader spectrum of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression, and
* dementia praecox.

Drawing on his long-term research, and using the criteria of course, outcome and prognosis, he developed the concept of dementia praecox, which he defined as the &quot;sub-acute development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at a youthful age&quot;. When he first introduced this concept as a diagnostic entity in the fourth German edition of his &quot;Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie&quot; in 1893, it was placed among the degenerative disorders alongside, but separate from, catatonia and dementia paranoides. At that time, the concept corresponded by and large with Ewald Hecker&#x27;s hebephrenia. In the sixth edition of the &quot;Lehrbuch&quot; in 1899 all three of these clinical types are treated as different expressions of one disease, dementia praecox.

One of the cardinal principles of his method was the recognition that any given symptom may appear in virtually any one of these disorders; e.g., there is almost no single symptom occurring in dementia praecox which cannot sometimes be found in manic depression. What distinguishes each disease symptomatically (as opposed to the underlying pathology) is not any particular (pathognomonic) symptom or symptoms, but a specific pattern of symptoms. In the absence of a direct physiological or genetic test or marker for each disease, it is only possible to distinguish them by their specific pattern of symptoms. Thus, Kraepelin&#x27;s system is a method for pattern recognition, not grouping by common symptoms.

It has been claimed that Kraepelin also demonstrated specific patterns in the genetics of these disorders and patterns in their course and outcome, but no specific biomarkers have yet been identified. Generally speaking, there tend to be more people with schizophrenia among the relatives of schizophrenic patients than in the general population, while manic depression is more frequent in the relatives of manic depressives. Though, of course, this does not demonstrate genetic linkage, as this might be a socio-environmental factor as well.

He also reported a pattern to the course and outcome of these conditions. Kraepelin believed that schizophrenia had a deteriorating course in which mental function continuously (although perhaps erratically) declines, while manic-depressive patients experienced a course of illness which was intermittent, where patients were relatively symptom-free during the intervals which separate acute episodes. This led Kraepelin to name what we now know as schizophrenia, dementia praecox (the dementia part signifying the irreversible mental decline). It later became clear that dementia praecox did not necessarily lead to mental decline and was thus renamed schizophrenia by Eugen Bleuler to correct Kraepelin&#x27;s misnomer.

In addition, as Kraepelin accepted in 1920, &quot;It is becoming increasingly obvious that we cannot satisfactorily distinguish these two diseases&quot;; however, he maintained that &quot;On the one hand we find those patients with irreversible dementia and severe cortical lesions. On the other are those patients whose personality remains intact&quot;. Nevertheless, overlap between the diagnoses and neurological abnormalities (when found) have continued, and in fact a diagnostic category of schizoaffective disorder would be brought in to cover the intermediate cases.

Kraepelin devoted very few pages to his speculations about the etiology of his two major insanities, dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity. However, from 1896 to his death in 1926 he held to the speculation that these insanities (particularly dementia praecox) would one day probably be found to be caused by a gradual systemic or &quot;whole body&quot; disease process, probably metabolic, which affected many of the organs and nerves in the body but affected the brain in a final, decisive cascade.

=== Psychopathic personalities ===
In the first through sixth edition of Kraepelin&#x27;s influential psychiatry textbook, there was a section on moral insanity, which meant then a disorder of the emotions or moral sense without apparent delusions or hallucinations, and which Kraepelin defined as &quot;lack or weakness of those sentiments which counter the ruthless satisfaction of egotism&quot;. He attributed this mainly to degeneration. This has been described as a psychiatric redefinition of Cesare Lombroso&#x27;s theories of the &quot;born criminal&quot;, conceptualised as a &quot;moral defect&quot;, though Kraepelin stressed it was not yet possible to recognise them by physical characteristics.

In fact from 1904 Kraepelin changed the section heading to &quot;The born criminal&quot;, moving it from under &quot;Congenital feeble-mindedness&quot; to a new chapter on &quot;Psychopathic personalities&quot;. They were treated under a theory of degeneration. Four types were distinguished: born criminals (inborn delinquents), pathological liars, querulous persons, and Triebmenschen (persons driven by a basic compulsion, including vagabonds, spendthrifts, and dipsomaniacs).

The concept of &quot;psychopathic inferiorities&quot; had been recently popularised in Germany by Julius Ludwig August Koch, who proposed congenital and acquired types. Kraepelin had no evidence or explanation suggesting a congenital cause, and his assumption therefore appears to have been simple &quot;biologism&quot;. Others, such as Gustav Aschaffenburg, argued for a varying combination of causes. Kraepelin&#x27;s assumption of a moral defect rather than a positive drive towards crime has also been questioned, as it implies that the moral sense is somehow inborn and unvarying, yet it was known to vary by time and place, and Kraepelin never considered that the moral sense might just be different.

Kurt Schneider criticized Kraepelin&#x27;s nosology on topics such as Haltlose for appearing to be a list of behaviors that he considered undesirable, rather than medical conditions, though Schneider&#x27;s alternative version has also been criticised on the same basis. Nevertheless, many essentials of these diagnostic systems were introduced into the diagnostic systems, and remarkable similarities remain in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. The issues would today mainly be considered under the category of personality disorders, or in terms of Kraepelin&#x27;s focus on psychopathy.

Kraepelin had referred to psychopathic conditions (or &quot;states&quot;) in his 1896 edition, including compulsive insanity, impulsive insanity, homosexuality, and mood disturbances. From 1904, however, he instead termed those &quot;original disease conditions, and introduced the new alternative category of psychopathic personalities. In the eighth edition from 1909 that category would include, in addition to a separate &quot;dissocial&quot; type, the excitable, the unstable, the Triebmenschen driven persons, eccentrics, the liars and swindlers, and the quarrelsome. It has been described as remarkable that Kraepelin now considered mood disturbances to be not part of the same category, but only attenuated (more mild) phases of manic depressive illness; this corresponds to current classification schemes.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Kraepelin postulated that there is a specific brain or other biological pathology underlying each of the major psychiatric disorders. As a colleague of Alois Alzheimer, he was a co-discoverer of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and his laboratory discovered its pathological basis. Kraepelin was confident that it would someday be possible to identify the pathological basis of each of the major psychiatric disorders.

=== Eugenics ===

Upon moving to become Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Munich in 1903, Kraepelin increasingly wrote on social policy issues. He was a strong and influential proponent of eugenics and racial hygiene. His publications included a focus on alcoholism, crime, degeneration and hysteria.

Kraepelin was convinced that such institutions as the education system and the welfare state, because of their trend to break the processes of natural selection, undermined the Germans&#x27; biological &quot;struggle for survival&quot;. He was concerned to preserve and enhance the German people, the Volk, in the sense of nation or race. He appears to have held Lamarckian concepts of evolution, such that cultural deterioration could be inherited. He was a strong ally and promoter of the work of fellow psychiatrist (and pupil and later successor as director of the clinic) Ernst Rüdin to clarify the mechanisms of genetic inheritance as to make a so-called &quot;empirical genetic prognosis&quot;.

Martin Brune has pointed out that Kraepelin and Rüdin also appear to have been ardent advocates of a self-domestication theory, a version of social Darwinism which held that modern culture was not allowing people to be weeded out, resulting in more mental disorder and deterioration of the gene pool. Kraepelin saw a number of &quot;symptoms&quot; of this, such as &quot;weakening of viability and resistance, decreasing fertility, proletarianisation, and moral damage due to &quot;penning up people&quot; [&quot;Zusammenpferchung&quot;]. He also wrote that &quot;the number of idiots, epileptics, psychopaths, criminals, prostitutes, and tramps who descend from alcoholic and syphilitic parents, and who transfer their inferiority to their offspring, is incalculable&quot;. He felt that &quot;the well-known example of the Jews, with their strong disposition towards nervous and mental disorders, teaches us that their extraordinarily advanced domestication may eventually imprint clear marks on the race&quot;. Brune states that Kraepelin&#x27;s nosological system &quot;was, to a great deal, built on the degeneration paradigm&quot;.

Kraepelin&#x27;s great contribution in classifying schizophrenia and manic depression remains relatively unknown to the general public, and his work, which had neither the literary quality nor paradigmatic power of Freud&#x27;s, is little read outside scholarly circles. Kraepelin&#x27;s contributions were also to a large extent marginalized throughout a good part of the 20th century during the success of Freudian etiological theories. However, his views now dominate many quarters of psychiatric research and academic psychiatry. His fundamental theories on the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders form the basis of the major diagnostic systems in use today, especially the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM-IV and the World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD system, based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria and earlier Feighner Criteria developed by espoused &quot;neo-Kraepelinians&quot;, though Robert Spitzer and others in the DSM committees were keen not to include assumptions about causation as Kraepelin had.

Kraepelin has been described as a &quot;scientific manager&quot; and political operator, who developed a large-scale, clinically oriented, epidemiological research programme. In this role he took in clinical information from a wide range of sources and networks. Despite proclaiming high clinical standards for himself to gather information &quot;by means of expert analysis of individual cases&quot;, he would also draw on the reported observations of officials not trained in psychiatry. The various editions of his textbooks do not contain detailed case histories of individuals, however, but mosaiclike compilations of typical statements and behaviors from patients with a specific diagnosis.

Kraepelin wrote in a &quot;knapp und klar&quot; (concise and clear) style that made his books useful tools for physicians. Abridged and clumsy English translations of the sixth and seventh editions of his textbook in 1902 and 1907 (respectively) by Allan Ross Diefendorf (1871–1943), an assistant physician at the Connecticut Hospital for the Insane at Middletown, inadequately conveyed the literary quality of his writings that made them so valuable to practitioners.

Among the doctors trained by Alois Alzheimer and Emil Kraepelin at Munich at the beginning of the 20th century were the Spanish neuropathologists and neuropsychiatrists Nicolás Achúcarro and Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora, two distinguished disciples of Santiago Ramón y Cajal and members of the Spanish Neurological School.

== Dreaming for psychiatry&#x27;s sake ==
In the Heidelberg and early Munich years he edited &quot;Psychologische Arbeiten&quot;, a journal on experimental psychology. One of his own famous contributions to this journal also appeared in the form of a monograph (105 pp.) entitled &quot;Über Sprachstörungen im Traume&quot; (&quot;On Language Disturbances in Dreams&quot;). Kraepelin, on the basis of the dream-psychosis analogy, studied for more than 20 years language disorder in dreams in order to study indirectly schizophasia. The dreams Kraepelin collected are mainly his own. They lack extensive comment by the dreamer. In order to study them the full range of biographical knowledge available today on Kraepelin is necessary (see, e.g., Burgmair et al., I-IX).

<text>The Evoluon is a UFO-shaped building located in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. It was built in 1966 as a science museum by the electronics and electrical company Philips. It quickly became a landmark in Eindhoven, where Philips was headquartered at the time. The museum closed in 1989 and the building became a conference centre and exhibition venue in 1998. In 2022 it reopened for the general public again as the Next Nature Museum.

The building is unique due to its very futuristic design, resembling a landed flying saucer. It was designed by architects Leo de Bever and Louis Christiaan Kalff, while the exhibition it housed was conceived by James Gardner. De Bever and Kalff only got two demands for the design of the building, it had to be &quot;spectacular&quot; and it had to be possible to hold exhibitions in the building.

Its concrete dome is in diameter and is held in place by of reinforcing steel bars.

In the 1960s and 1970s the Evoluon attracted large numbers of visitors due to its innovative interactive exhibitions. When competing science museums opened in other cities, the number of visitors declined and the original museum closed down in 1989. The building was converted into a conference centre which opened in 1998.

In the UK the Evoluon is chiefly remembered from Bert Haanstra&#x27;s wordless short film entitled simply &quot;Evoluon&quot;, commissioned by Philips to publicise the museum, and shown as a trade test colour film on BBC television from 1968 to 1972.

In October 2013 the Evoluon was used to stage four 3D-concerts by the German electronic band Kraftwerk, each before an audience of 1,200 spectators. Key band member Ralf Hütter handpicked the venue for its retro-futuristic look. Bespoke 3D-visuals of the saucer section of the building descending from space were used in the live rendition of their track &quot;Spacelab&quot;.

On September 24, 2022, the Evoluon reopened to the public with the &quot;RetroFuture&quot; exhibition.

<text>Educational essentialism is an educational philosophy whose adherents believe that children should learn the traditional basic subjects thoroughly. In this philosophical school of thought, the aim is to instill students with the &quot;essentials&quot; of academic knowledge, enacting a back-to-basics approach. Essentialism ensures that the accumulated wisdom of our civilization as taught in the traditional academic disciplines is passed on from teacher to student. Such disciplines might include Reading, Writing, Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Mathematics, Classical Languages, Science, Art, and Music. Moreover, this traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture.

==Principles of essentialism==

Essentialism is a relatively conservative stance to education that strives to teach students the knowledge of a society and civilization through a core curriculum. This core curriculum involves such areas that include; the study of the surrounding environment, basic natural laws, and the disciplines that promote a happier, more educated living. Other non-traditional areas are also integrated as well in moderation to balance the education. Essentialists&#x27; goals are to instill students with the &quot;essentials&quot; of academic knowledge, patriotism, and character development through traditional (or back-to-basic) approaches. This is to promote reasoning, train the mind, and ensure a common culture for all citizens.

Essentialism is the most typically enacted philosophy in American classrooms today. Traces of this can be found in the organized learning centered on teachers and textbooks, in addition to the regular assignments and evaluations.

===Essentialism as a teacher-centered philosophy===

The role of the teacher as the leader of the classroom is a very important tenet of Educational essentialism. The teacher is the center of the classroom, so they should be rigid and disciplinary. Establishing order in the classroom is crucial for student learning; effective teaching cannot take place in a loud and disorganized environment. It is the teacher&#x27;s responsibility to keep order in the classroom. The teacher must interpret essentials of the learning process, take the leadership position and set the tone of the classroom. These needs require an educator who is academically well-qualified with an appreciation for learning and development. The teacher must control the students with distributions of rewards and penalties. It has been argued that recent teacher education policies in some countries extend essentialism to teacher education policy frameworks.

==History of essentialism==
The Essentialist movement first began in the United States in the year 1938. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, a group met for the first time called &quot;The Essentialist&#x27;s Committee for the Advancement of Education.&quot; Their emphasis was to reform the educational system to a rationality-based system.

The term essentialist first appeared in the book &quot;An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education&quot; which was written by Michael John Demiashkevich. In his book, Demiashkevich labels some specific educators (including William C. Bagley) as “essentialists.&quot; Demiashkevich compared the essentialists to the different viewpoints of the Progressive Education Association. He described how the Progressives preached a “hedonistic doctrine of change” whereas the essentialists stressed the moral responsibility of man for his actions and looked toward permanent principles of behavior (Demiashkevich likened the arguments to those between the Socratics and the Sophists in Greek philosophy). In 1938 Bagley and other educators met together where Bagley gave a speech detailing the main points of the essentialism movement and attacking the public education in the United States. One point that Bagley noted was that students in the U.S. were not getting an education on the same levels as students in Europe who were the same age.

A recent branch has emerged within the essentialist school of thought called &quot;neoessentialism.&quot; Emerging in the eighties as a response to the essentialist ideals of the thirties as well as to the criticism of the fifties and the advocates for education in the seventies, neoessentialism was created to try to appease the problems facing the United States at the time. The most notable change within this school of thought is that it called for the creation of a new discipline, computer science.

===Renowned essentialists===

William Bagley (1874–1946) was an important historical essentialist. William C. Bagley completed his undergraduate degree at Michigan Agricultural College in 1895. It wasn&#x27;t until after finishing his undergraduate studies that he truly wanted to be a teacher. Bagley did his Graduate studies at the University of Chicago and at Cornell University. He acquired his Ph.D. in 1900, after which he took his first school job as a Principal in a St. Louis, Missouri Elementary School. Bagley&#x27;s devotion increased during his work at Montana State Normal School in Dillon, Montana. It was here where he decided to dedicate his time to the education of teachers and where he published &quot;The Educative Process&quot;, launching his name across the nation. Throughout his career Bagley argued against the conservative position that teachers were not in need of special training for their work. He believed that liberal arts material was important in teacher education. Bagley also believed the dominant theories of education of the time were weak and lacking.

In April 1938, he published the &quot;Essentialist&#x27;s Platform&quot;, in which he outlined three major points of essentialism. He described the right of students to a well-educated and culturally knowledgeable teacher. Secondly, he discussed the importance of teaching the ideals of community to each group of students. Lastly, Bagley wrote of the importance of accuracy, thoroughness and effort on the part of the student in the classroom.

Another important essentialist is E. D. Hirsch (1928-). Hirsch was Founder and Chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation and authored several books concerning fact-based approaches to education. Now retired, he spent many years teaching at the University of Virginia while also being an advocate for the &quot;back to basics&quot; movement. In his most popular book, &quot;Cultural Literacy — What Every American Needs To Know&quot;, he offers lists, quotations, and information regarding what he believes is essential knowledge.

==Schools enacting an essentialist curriculum==
The Core Knowledge Schools were founded on the philosophy of essentialist E.D. Hirsch. Although it is difficult to maintain a pure and strict essentialist-only curriculum, these schools have the central aim of establishing a common knowledge base for all citizens. To do so, they follow a nationwide, content-specific, and teacher-centered curriculum. The Core Knowledge curriculum also allows for local variance above and beyond the core curriculum. Central curricular aims are academic excellence and the learning of knowledge, and teachers who are masters of their knowledge areas serve this aim.

==Criticism of essentialism==

Because Essentialism is largely teacher-centered, the role of the student is often called into question. Presumably, in an essentialist classroom, the teacher is the one designing the curriculum for the students based upon the core disciplines. Moreover, he or she is enacting the curriculum and setting the standards which the students must meet. The teacher&#x27;s evaluative role may undermine students&#x27; interest in study. As a result, the students begin to take on more of a passive role in their education as they are forced to meet and learn such standards and information.

Furthermore, there is also speculation that an essentialist education helps in promoting the cultural lag. This philosophy of education is very traditional in the mindset of passing on the knowledge of the culture via the academic disciplines. Thus, students are forced to think in the mindset of the larger culture, and individual creativity, and subversive investigation are often not emphasized, or even outright discouraged.

<doc id="10005" wikidata="Q834933" url="?curid=10005" title="Progressive education">
<text>Progressive education, or educational progressivism, is a pedagogical movement that began in the late 19th century and has persisted in various forms to the present. In Europe, progressive education took the form of the New Education Movement. The term &quot;progressive&quot; was engaged to distinguish this education from the traditional curricula of the 19th century, which was rooted in classical preparation for the early-industrial university and strongly differentiated by social class. By contrast, progressive education finds its roots in modern, post-industrial experience. Most progressive education programs have these qualities in common: 

* Emphasis on learning by doing – hands-on projects, expeditionary learning, experiential learning
* Integrated curriculum focused on thematic units
* Strong emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking
* Group work and development of social skills
* Understanding and action as the goals of learning as opposed to rote knowledge
* Collaborative and cooperative learning projects
* Education for social responsibility and democracy
* Integration of community service and service learning projects into the daily curriculum
* Selection of subject content by looking forward to ask what skills will be needed in future society
* De-emphasis on textbooks in favor of varied learning resources
* Emphasis on lifelong learning and social skills
* Assessment by evaluation of child&#x27;s projects and productions

== History ==

Progressive education can be traced back to the works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by theorists such as John Dewey. Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, Locke believed that &quot;truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas&quot;. He further discussed the need for children to have concrete experiences in order to learn. Rousseau deepened this line of thinking in Emile, or On Education, where he argued that subordination of students to teachers and memorization of facts would not lead to an education.

===Johann Bernhard Basedow===
In Germany, Johann Bernhard Basedow (1724–1790) established the Philanthropinum at Dessau in 1774. He developed new teaching methods based on conversation and play with the child, and a program of physical development. Such was his success that he wrote a treatise on his methods, &quot;On the best and hitherto unknown method of teaching children of noblemen&quot;.

===Christian Gotthilf Salzmann===
Christian Gotthilf Salzmann (1744–1811) was the founder of the Schnepfenthal institution, a school dedicated to new modes of education (derived heavily from the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau). He wrote &quot;Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children&quot;, one of the first books translated into English by Mary Wollstonecraft.

=== Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi ===
Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827) was a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer who exemplified Romanticism in his approach. He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was &quot;Learning by head, hand and heart&quot;. His research and theories closely resemble those outlined by Rousseau in Emile. He is further considered by many to be the &quot;father of modern educational science&quot; His psychological theories pertain to education as they focus on the development of object teaching, that is, he felt that individuals best learned through experiences and through a direct manipulation and experience of objects. He further speculated that children learn through their own internal motivation rather than through compulsion. (See Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic motivation). A teacher&#x27;s task will be to help guide their students as individuals through their learning and allow it to unfold naturally.

===Friedrich Fröbel===
Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel (1782–1852) was a student of Pestalozzi who laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He believed in &quot;self-activity&quot; and play as essential factors in child education. The teacher&#x27;s role was not to indoctrinate but to encourage self-expression through play, both individually and in group activities. He created the concept of kindergarten.

===Johann Friedrich Herbart===
Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841) emphasized the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice, and Equity or Recompense. According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. In order to develop a child to lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilize a methodology with five formal steps: &quot;Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back, and deductively summed up the lesson&#x27;s achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living&quot;.

===John Melchior Bosco===
John Melchior Bosco (1815–1888) was concerned about the education of street children who had left their villages to find work in the rapidly industrialized city of Turin, Italy. Exploited as cheap labor or imprisoned for unruly behavior, Bosco saw the need for creating a space where they would feel at home. He called it an &#x27;Oratory&#x27; where they could play, learn, share friendships, express themselves, develop their creative talents and pick up skills for gainful self-employment. With those who had found work, he set up a mutual-fund society (an early version of the Grameen Bank) to teach them the benefits of saving and self-reliance. The principles underlying his educational method that won over the hearts and minds of thousands of youth who flocked to his oratory were: &#x27;be reasonable&#x27;, &#x27;be kind&#x27;, &#x27;believe&#x27; and &#x27;be generous in service&#x27;. Today his method of education is practiced in nearly 3000 institutions set up around the world by the members of the Salesian Society he founded in 1873.

===Cecil Reddie===
While studying for his doctorate in Göttingen in 1882–1883, Cecil Reddie was greatly impressed by the progressive educational theories being applied there. Reddie founded Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire, England, in 1889. Its curriculum enacted the ideas of progressive education. Reddie rejected rote learning, classical languages and corporal punishment. He combined studies in modern languages and the sciences and arts with a program of physical exercise, manual labour, recreation, crafts and arts. Schools modeling themselves after Abbotsholme were established throughout Europe, and the model was particularly influential in Germany. Reddie often engaged foreign teachers, who learned its practices, before returning home to start their own schools. Hermann Lietz an Abbotsholme teacher founded five schools (Landerziehungsheime für Jungen) on Abbotsholme&#x27;s principles. Other people he influenced included Kurt Hahn, Adolphe Ferrière and Edmond Demolins. His ideas also reached Japan, where it turned into &quot;Taisho-era Free Education Movement&quot; (Taisho Jiyu Kyoiku Undo)

===John Dewey===
Education according to John Dewey is the &quot;participation of the individual in the social consciousness of the race&quot; (Dewey, 1897, para. 1). As such, education should take into account that the student is a social being. The process begins at birth with the child unconsciously gaining knowledge and gradually developing their knowledge to share and partake in society.

For Dewey, education, which regulates &quot;the process of coming to share in the social consciousness,&quot; is the &quot;only sure&quot; method of ensuring social progress and reform (Dewey, 1897, para. 60). In this respect, Dewey foreshadows Social Reconstructionism, whereby schools are a means to reconstruct society. As schools become a means for social reconstruction, they must be given the proper equipment to perform this task and guide their students.

===Helen Parkhurst===
The American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886–1973) developed the Dalton Plan at the beginning of the twentieth century with the goal of reforming the then current pedagogy and classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912, Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine- to fourteen-year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students&#x27; own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students&#x27; reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject.

In the nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties, Dalton education spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan.

===Rudolf Steiner===
Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925) first described the principles of what was to become Waldorf education in 1907. He established a series of schools based on these principles beginning in 1919. The focus of the education is on creating a developmentally appropriate curriculum that holistically integrates practical, artistic, social, and academic experiences. There are more than a thousand schools and many more early childhood centers worldwide; it has also become a popular form of homeschooling.

===Maria Montessori===
Maria Montessori (1870–1952) began to develop her philosophy and methods in 1897. She based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as &quot;scientific pedagogy&quot;, arguing for the need to go beyond observation and measurement of students, to developing new methods to transform them. Although Montessori education spread to the United States in 1911 there were conflicts with the American educational establishment and was opposed by William Heard Kilpatrick. However Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there.

In 1914 the Montessori Society in England organised its first conference. Hosted by Rev Bertram Hawker, who had set up, in partnership with his local elementary school in the Norfolk coastal village of East Runton, the first Montessori School in England. Pictures of this school, and its children, illustrated the &#x27;Montessori&#x27;s Own Handbook&#x27; (1914). Hawker had been impressed by his visit to Montessori&#x27;s Casa dei Bambini in Rome, he gave numerous talks on Montessori&#x27;s work after 1912, assisting in generating a national interest in her work. He organised the Montessori Conference 1914 in partnership with Edmond Holmes, ex-Chief Inspector of Schools, who had written a government report on Montessori. The conference decided that its remit was to promote the &#x27;liberation of the child in the school&#x27;, and though inspired by Montessori, would encourage, support and network teachers and educationalists who sought, through their schools and methods, that aim. They changed their name the following year to New Ideals in Education. Each subsequent conference was opened with reference to its history and origin as a Montessori Conference recognising her inspiration, reports italicized the members of the Montessori Society in the delegate lists, and numerous further events included Montessori methods and case studies. Montessori, through New Ideals in Education, its committee and members, events and publications, greatly influenced progressive state education in England. (references to be added).

===Robert Baden-Powell===
In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Robert Baden-Powell a copy of his book &quot;The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians&quot;. Seton was a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States. They shared ideas about youth training programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called &quot;Boy Patrols&quot;. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in England. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader. Baden Powell then wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; (London, 1908). The Brownsea camp and the publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement which spread throughout the world. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910.

===Comparison with traditional education===
Traditional education uses extrinsic motivation, such as grades and prizes. Progressive education is more likely to use intrinsic motivation, basing activities on the interests of the child. Praise may be discouraged as a motivator. Progressive education is a response to traditional methods of teaching. It is defined as an educational movement which gives more value to experience than formal learning. It is based more on experiential learning that concentrate on the development of a child&#x27;s talents.

===21st century skills===

21st century skills are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in the rapidly changing, digital society and workplaces. Many of these skills are also defining qualities of &quot;progressive education&quot; as well as being associated with deeper learning, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork. These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based. The focus of progressive pedagogies on fostering 21st-century skills may also explain why these schools maintain their appeal, particularly among a segment of highly-educated, middle-class parents.

== In the West ==
===Germany===
Hermann Lietz founded three Landerziehungsheime (country boarding schools) in 1904 based on Reddie&#x27;s model for boys of different ages. Lietz eventually succeeded in establishing five more Landerziehungsheime. Edith and Paul Geheeb founded Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim in the Odenwald in 1910 using their concept of progressive education, which integrated the work of the head and hand.

===Poland===
Janusz Korczak was one notable follower and developer of Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideas. He wrote
&quot;The names of Pestalozzi, Froebel and Spencer shine with no less brilliance than the names of the greatest inventors of the twentieth century. For they discovered more than the unknown forces of nature; they discovered the unknown half of humanity: children.&quot; His Orphan&#x27;s Home in Warsaw became a model institution and exerted influence on the educational process in other orphanages of the same type.

===Ireland===
The Quaker school run in Ballitore, Co Kildare in the 18th century had students from as far away as Bordeaux (where there was a substantial Irish émigré population), the Caribbean and Norway. Notable pupils included Edmund Burke and Napper Tandy.
Sgoil Éanna, or in English St Enda&#x27;s was founded in 1908 by Pádraig Pearse on Montessori principles. Its former assistant headmaster Thomas MacDonagh and other teachers including Pearse; games master Con Colbert; Pearse&#x27;s brother, Willie, the art teacher, and Joseph Plunkett, and occasional lecturer in English, were executed by the British after the 1916 Rising. Pearse and MacDonagh were two of the seven leaders who signed the Irish Declaration of Independence. Pearse&#x27;s book &quot;The Murder Machine&quot; was a denunciation of the English school system of the time and a declaration of his own educational principles.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, an early proponent of progressive education was Alva Myrdal, who with her husband Gunnar co-wrote &quot;Kris i befolkningsfrågan&quot; (1934), a most influential program for the social-democratic hegemony (1932–1976) popularly known as &quot;Folkhemmet&quot;. School reforms went through government reports in the 1940s and trials in the 1950s, resulting in the introduction in 1962 of public comprehensive schools (&quot;grundskola&quot;) instead of the previously separated parallel schools for theoretical and non-theoretical education.

===United Kingdom===
The ideas from Reddie&#x27;s Abbotsholme spread to schools such as Bedales School (1893), King Alfred School, London (1898) and St Christopher School, Letchworth (1915), as well as all the Friends&#x27; schools, Steiner Waldorf schools and those belonging to the Round Square Conference. The King Alfred School was radical for its time in that it provided a secular education and that boys and girls were educated together. Alexander Sutherland Neill believed children should achieve self-determination and should be encouraged to think critically rather than blindly obeying. He implemented his ideas with the founding of Summerhill School in 1921. Neill believed that children learn better when they are not compelled to attend lessons. The school was also managed democratically, with regular meetings to determine school rules. Pupils had equal voting rights with school staff.

===United States===
====Early practitioners====
Fröbel&#x27;s student Margarethe Schurz founded the first kindergarten in the United States at Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1856, and she also inspired Elizabeth Peabody, who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz&#x27;s kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in Boston in 1860. This paved the way for the concept&#x27;s spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but was obliged to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in New York City.

William Heard Kilpatrick (1871–1965) was a pupil of Dewey and one of the most effective practitioners of the concept as well as the more adept at proliferating the progressive education movement and spreading word of the works of Dewey. He is especially well known for his &quot;project method of teaching&quot;. This developed the progressive education notion that students were to be engaged and taught so that their knowledge may be directed to society for a socially useful need. Like Dewey he also felt that students should be actively engaged in their learning rather than actively disengaged with the simple reading and regurgitation of material.

The most famous early practitioner of progressive education was Francis Parker; its best-known spokesperson was the philosopher John Dewey. In 1875 Francis Parker became superintendent of schools in Quincy, Massachusetts, after spending two years in Germany studying emerging educational trends on the continent. Parker was opposed to rote learning, believing that there was no value in knowledge without understanding. He argued instead schools should encourage and respect the child&#x27;s creativity. Parker&#x27;s Quincy System called for child-centered and experience-based learning. He replaced the traditional curriculum with integrated learning units based on core themes related to the knowledge of different disciplines. He replaced traditional readers, spellers and grammar books with children&#x27;s own writing, literature, and teacher prepared materials. In 1883 Parker left Massachusetts to become Principal of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago, a school that also served to train teachers in Parker&#x27;s methods. In 1894 Parker&#x27;s Talks on Pedagogics, which drew heavily on the thinking of Fröbel, Pestalozzi and Herbart, became one of the first American writings on education to gain international fame.

That same year, philosopher John Dewey moved from the University of Michigan to the newly established University of Chicago where he became chair of the department of philosophy, psychology and education. He and his wife enrolled their children in Parker&#x27;s school before founding their own school two years later.

Whereas Parker started with practice and then moved to theory, Dewey began with hypotheses and then devised methods and curricula to test them. By the time Dewey moved to Chicago at the age of thirty-five, he had already published two books on psychology and applied psychology. He had become dissatisfied with philosophy as pure speculation and was seeking ways to make philosophy directly relevant to practical issues. Moving away from an early interest in Hegel, Dewey proceeded to reject all forms of dualism and dichotomy in favor of a philosophy of experience as a series of unified wholes in which everything can be ultimately related.

In 1896, John Dewey opened what he called the laboratory school to test his theories and their sociological implications. With Dewey as the director and his wife as principal, the University of Chicago Laboratory school, was dedicated &quot;to discover in administration, selection of subject-matter, methods of learning, teaching, and discipline, how a school could become a cooperative community while developing in individuals their own capacities and satisfy their own needs.&quot; (Cremin, 136) For Dewey the two key goals of developing a cooperative community and developing individuals&#x27; own capacities were not at odds; they were necessary to each other. This unity of purpose lies at the heart of the progressive education philosophy. In 1912, Dewey sent out students of his philosophy to found The Park School of Buffalo and The Park School of Baltimore to put it into practice. These schools operate to this day within a similar progressive approach.

At Columbia, Dewey worked with other educators such as Charles Eliot and Abraham Flexner to help bring progressivism into the mainstream of American education. In 1917 Columbia established the Lincoln School of Teachers College &quot;as a laboratory for the working out of an elementary and secondary curriculum which shall eliminate obsolete material and endeavor to work up in usable form material adapted to the needs of modern living.&quot; (Cremin, 282) Based on Flexner&#x27;s demand that the modern curriculum &quot;include nothing for which an affirmative case can not be made out&quot; (Cremin, 281) the new school organized its activities around four fundamental fields: science, industry, aesthetics and civics. The Lincoln School built its curriculum around &quot;units of work&quot; that reorganized traditional subject matter into forms embracing the development of children and the changing needs of adult life. The first and second grades carried on a study of community life in which they actually built a city. A third grade project growing out of the day-to-day life of the nearby Hudson River became one of the most celebrated units of the school, a unit on boats, which under the guidance of its legendary teacher Miss Curtis, became an entrée into history, geography, reading, writing, arithmetic, science, art and literature. Each of the units was broadly enough conceived so that different children could concentrate on different aspects depending on their own interests and needs. Each of the units called for widely diverse student activities, and each sought to deal in depth with some critical aspect of contemporary civilization. Finally each unit engaged children working together cooperatively and also provided opportunities for individual research and exploration.

In 1924, Agnes de Lima, the lead writer on education for &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, published a collection of her articles on progressive education as a book, titled &quot;Our Enemy the Child&quot;.

In 1918, the National Education Association, representing superintendents and administrators in smaller districts across the country, issued its report &quot;Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education.&quot; It emphasized the education of students in terms of health, a command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. They emphasized life adjustment and reflected the social efficiency model of progressive education.

From 1919 to 1955, the Progressive Education Association founded by Stanwood Cobb and others worked to promote a more student-centered approach to education. During the Great Depression the organization conducted the Eight-Year Study, evaluating the effects of progressive programs. More than 1500 students over four years were compared to an equal number of carefully matched students at conventional schools. When they reached college, the experimental students were found to equal or surpass traditionally educated students on all outcomes: grades, extracurricular participation, dropout rates, intellectual curiosity, and resourcefulness. Moreover, the study found that the more the school departed from the traditional college preparatory program, the better was the record of the graduates. (Kohn, Schools, 232)

By mid-century, many public school programs had also adopted elements of progressive curriculum. At mid-century Dewey believed that progressive education had &quot;not really penetrated and permeated the foundations of the educational institution.&quot;(Kohn, Schools, 6,7) As the influence of progressive pedagogy grew broader and more diffuse, practitioners began to vary their application of progressive principles. As varying interpretations and practices made evaluation of progressive reforms more difficult to assess, critics began to propose alternative approaches.

The seeds of the debate over progressive education can be seen in the differences of Parker and Dewey. These have to do with how much and by whom curriculum should be worked out from grade to grade, how much the child&#x27;s emerging interests should determine classroom activities, the importance of child-centered vs. societal–centered learning, the relationship of community building to individual growth, and especially the relationship between emotion, thought and experience.

In 1955, the publication of Rudolf Flesch&#x27;s &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; leveled criticism of reading programs at the progressive emphasis on reading in context. The conservative McCarthy era raised questions about the liberal ideas at the roots of the progressive reforms. The launching of Sputnik in 1957 at the height of the Cold War gave rise to a number of intellectually competitive approaches to disciplinary knowledge, such as BSCS biology PSSC physics, led by university professors such as Jerome Bruner and Jerrold Zacharias.

Some Cold War reforms incorporated elements of progressivism. For example, the work of Zacharias and Bruner was based in the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget and incorporated many of Dewey&#x27;s ideas of experiential education. Bruner&#x27;s analysis of developmental psychology became the core of a pedagogical movement known as constructivism, which argues that the child is an active participant in making meaning and must be engaged in the progress of education for learning to be effective. This psychological approach has deep connections to the work of both Parker and Dewey and led to a resurgence of their ideas in second half of the century.

In 1965, President Johnson inaugurated the Great Society and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act suffused public school programs with funds for sweeping education reforms. At the same time the influx of federal funding also gave rise to demands for accountability and the behavioral objectives approach of Robert F. Mager and others foreshadowed the No Child Left Behind Act passed in 2002. Against these critics eloquent spokespersons stepped forward in defense of the progressive tradition. The Open Classroom movement, led by Herb Kohl and George Dennison, recalled many of Parker&#x27;s child centered reforms.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rise and decline in the number of progressive schools. There were several reasons for the decline:

* Demographics: As the baby boom passed, traditional classrooms were no longer as over-enrolled, reducing demand for alternatives.
* The economy: The oil crisis and recession made shoestring schools less viable.
* Times changed: With the ending of the Vietnam War, social activism waned.
* Co-optation: Many schools were co-opted by people who didn&#x27;t believe in the original mission.
* Centralization: The ongoing centralization of school districts
* Non-implementation: Schools failed to implement a model of shared governance
* Interpersonal dynamics: Disagreement over school goals, poor group process skills, lack of critical dialogue, and fear of assertive leadership

Progressive education has been viewed as an alternative to the test-oriented instruction legislated by the No Child Left Behind educational funding act. Alfie Kohn has been an outspoken critic of the No Child Left Behind Act and a passionate defender of the progressive tradition.

==In the East==
===India===
Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was one of the most effective practitioners of the concept of progressive education. He expanded Santiniketan, which is a small town near Bolpur in the Birbhum district of West Bengal, India, approximately 160 km north of Kolkata. He de-emphasized textbook learning in favor of varied learning resources from nature. The emphasis here was on self-motivation rather than on discipline, and on fostering intellectual curiosity rather than competitive excellence. There were courses on a great variety of cultures, and study programs devoted to China, Japan, and the Middle East. He was of the view that education should be a &quot;joyous exercise of our inventive and constructive energies that help us to build up character.&quot;

===Japan===
Seikatsu Tsuzurikata is a grassroots movement in Japan that has many parallels to the progressive education movement, but it developed completely independently, beginning in
the late 1920s. The Japanese progressive educational movement was one of the stepping stones to the modernization of Japan and it has resonated down to the present.

<doc id="10006" wikidata="Q1327500" url="?curid=10006" title="Electronic musical instrument">
<text>An electronic musical instrument or electrophone is a musical instrument that produces sound using electronic circuitry. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital audio signal that ultimately is plugged into a power amplifier which drives a loudspeaker, creating the sound heard by the performer and listener.

An electronic instrument might include a user interface for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the pitch, frequency, or duration of each note. A common user interface is the musical keyboard, which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic piano where the keys are each linked mechanically to swinging string hammers - whereas with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard interface is linked to a synth module, computer or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a music controller (input device) and a music synthesizer, respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as MIDI or Open Sound Control. The solid state nature of electronic keyboards also offers differing &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;response&quot;, offering a novel experience in playing relative to operating a mechanically linked piano keyboard.

All electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of audio signal processing applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called sound effects; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.

In the 21st century, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as electronic dance music, almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments (e.g., bass synth, synthesizer, drum machine). Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, such as the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

== Classification ==
In musicology, electronic musical instruments are known as electrophones. Electrophones are the fifth category of musical instrument under the Hornbostel-Sachs system. Musicologists typically only classify music as electrophones if the sound is initially produced by electricity, excluding electronically controlled acoustic instruments such as pipe organs and amplified instruments such as electric guitars.

The category was added to the Hornbostel-Sachs musical instrument classification system by Sachs in 1940, in his 1940 book &quot;The History of Musical Instruments&quot;; the original 1914 version of the system did not include it. Sachs divided electrophones into three subcategories:

* 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments (e.g., pipe organ with electronic tracker action)
* 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments (e.g., acoustic guitar with pickup)
* 53=instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators

The last category included instruments such as theremins or synthesizers, which he called instruments.

Francis William Galpin provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs-Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;A Textbook of European Musical Instruments&quot;, he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation (&quot;by oscillation&quot;, &quot;electro-magnetic&quot;, and &quot;electro-static&quot;), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method.

Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi and Terry Ellingson, suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel Sachs classification scheme, if one categorizes instruments by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus, it has been more recently proposed, for example, that the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, and so on.

== Early examples ==
In the 18th-century, musicians and composers adapted a number of acoustic instruments to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the Denis d&#x27;or keyboard, dating from 1753, followed shortly by the clavecin électrique by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The Denis d&#x27;or consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily to enhance sonic qualities. The clavecin électrique was a keyboard instrument with plectra (picks) activated electrically. However, neither instrument used electricity as a sound source.

The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray. The &quot;Musical Telegraph&quot; was a chance by-product of his telephone technology when Gray discovered that he could control sound from a self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit and so invented a basic oscillator. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds oscillated by electromagnets and transmitted over a telephone line. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device into later models, which consisted of a diaphragm vibrating in a magnetic field.

A significant invention, which later had a profound effect on electronic music, was the audion in 1906. This was the first thermionic valve, or vacuum tube and which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, among other things. Other early synthesizers included the Telharmonium (1897), the Theremin (1919), Jörg Mager&#x27;s Spharophon (1924) and Partiturophone, Taubmann&#x27;s similar Electronde (1933), Maurice Martenot&#x27;s ondes Martenot (&quot;Martenot waves&quot;, 1928), Trautwein&#x27;s Trautonium (1930). The Mellertion (1933) used a non-standard scale, Bertrand&#x27;s Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the Emicon was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German Hellertion combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhof&#x27;s Croix Sonore (1934), Ivor Darreg&#x27;s microtonal &#x27;Electronic Keyboard Oboe&#x27; (1937) and the ANS synthesizer, constructed by the Russian scientist Evgeny Murzin from 1937 to 1958. Only two models of this latter were built and the only surviving example is currently stored at the Lomonosov University in Moscow. It has been used in many Russian movies—like &quot;Solaris&quot;—to produce unusual, &quot;cosmic&quot; sounds.

Hugh Le Caine, John Hanert, Raymond Scott, composer Percy Grainger (with Burnett Cross), and others built a variety of automated electronic-music controllers during the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1959 Daphne Oram produced a novel method of synthesis, her &quot;Oramics&quot; technique, driven by drawings on a 35 mm film strip; it was used for a number of years at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. This workshop was also responsible for the theme to the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; a piece, largely created by Delia Derbyshire, that more than any other ensured the popularity of electronic music in the UK.

=== Telharmonium ===
In 1897 Thaddeus Cahill patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using tonewheels to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by additive synthesis, it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the Hammond organ. Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill&#x27;s enterprise was bankrupt.

=== Theremin ===

Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919–1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the Theremin. This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines. The Theremin was notable for being the first musical instrument played without touching it. In 1929, Joseph Schillinger composed &quot;First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra&quot;, premièred with the Cleveland Orchestra with Leon Theremin as soloist. The next year Henry Cowell commissioned Theremin to create the first electronic rhythm machine, called the Rhythmicon. Cowell wrote some compositions for it, which he and Schillinger premiered in 1932.

=== Ondes Martenot ===
The ondes Martenot is played with a keyboard or by moving a ring along a wire, creating &quot;wavering&quot; sounds similar to a theremin. It was invented in 1928 by the French cellist Maurice Martenot, who was inspired by the accidental overlaps of tones between military radio oscillators, and wanted to create an instrument with the expressiveness of the cello.

The French composer Olivier Messiaen used the ondes Martenot in pieces such as his 1949 symphony &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie,&quot; and his sister-in-law Jeanne Loriod was a celebrated player. It appears in numerous film and television soundtracks, particularly science fiction and horror films. Contemporary users of the ondes Martenot include Tom Waits, Daft Punk and the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.

=== Trautonium ===
The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the subharmonic scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of &quot;Parsifal&quot;. In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden première of his &quot;Japanese Festival Music&quot;. This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.

=== Hammond organ and Novachord ===
In 1929 Laurens Hammond established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the Hammond organ, which was based on the principles of the Telharmonium, along with other developments including early reverberation units. The Hammond organ is an electromechanical instrument, as it used both mechanical elements and electronic parts. A Hammond organ used spinning metal tonewheels to produce different sounds. A magnetic pickup similar in design to the pickups in an electric guitar is used to transmit the pitches in the tonewheels to an amplifier and speaker enclosure. While the Hammond organ was designed to be a lower-cost alternative to a pipe organ for church music, musicians soon discovered that the Hammond was an excellent instrument for blues and jazz; indeed, an entire genre of music developed built around this instrument, known as the organ trio (typically Hammond organ, drums, and a third instrument, either saxophone or guitar).

The first commercially manufactured synthesizer was the Novachord, built by the Hammond Organ Company from 1938 to 1942, which offered 72-note polyphony using 12 oscillators driving monostable-based divide-down circuits, basic envelope control and resonant low-pass filters. The instrument featured 163 vacuum tubes and weighed 500 pounds. The instrument&#x27;s use of envelope control is significant, since this is perhaps the most significant distinction between the modern synthesizer and other electronic instruments.
== Analogue synthesis 1950–1980 ==

The most commonly used electronic instruments are synthesizers, so-called because they artificially generate sound using a variety of techniques. All early circuit-based synthesis involved the use of analogue circuitry, particularly voltage controlled amplifiers, oscillators and filters. An important technological development was the invention of the Clavivox synthesizer in 1956 by Raymond Scott with subassembly by Robert Moog. French composer and engineer Edgard Varèse created a variety of compositions using electronic horns, whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote &quot;Poème électronique&quot; for the Philips pavilion at the Brussels World Fair in 1958.

=== Modular synthesizers ===

RCA produced experimental devices to synthesize voice and music in the 1950s. The Mark II Music Synthesizer, housed at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions from Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, it was only capable of producing music by programming, using a paper tape sequencer punched with holes to control pitch sources and filters, similar to a mechanical player piano but capable of generating a wide variety of sounds. The vacuum tube system had to be patched to create timbres.
In the 1960s synthesizers were still usually confined to studios due to their size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device. Harald Bode, Don Buchla, Hugh Le Caine, Raymond Scott and Paul Ketoff were among the first to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Buchla later produced a commercial modular synthesizer, the Buchla Music Easel. Robert Moog, who had been a student of Peter Mauzey and one of the RCA Mark II engineers, created a synthesizer that could reasonably be used by musicians, designing the circuits while he was at Columbia-Princeton. The Moog synthesizer was first displayed at the Audio Engineering Society convention in 1964. It required experience to set up sounds but was smaller and more intuitive than what had come before, less like a machine and more like a musical instrument. Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate triggering signal. This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a music sequencer producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included ARP, who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm EMS.

===Integrated synthesizers===

In 1970, Moog designed the Minimoog, a non-modular synthesizer with a built-in keyboard. The analogue circuits were interconnected with switches in a simplified arrangement called &quot;normalization.&quot; Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. The Minimoog sold 12,000 units. Further standardized the design of subsequent synthesizers with its integrated keyboard, pitch and modulation wheels and VCO-&gt;VCF-&gt;VCA signal flow. It has become celebrated for its &quot;fat&quot; sound—and its tuning problems. Miniaturized solid-state components allowed synthesizers to become self-contained, portable instruments that soon appeared in live performance and quickly became widely used in popular music and electronic art music.

===Polyphony===

Many early analog synthesizers were monophonic, producing only one tone at a time. Popular monophonic synthesizers include the Moog Minimoog. A few, such as the Moog Sonic Six, ARP Odyssey and EML 101, could produce two different pitches at a time when two keys were pressed. Polyphony (multiple simultaneous tones, which enables chords) was only obtainable with electronic organ designs at first. Popular electronic keyboards combining organ circuits with synthesizer processing included the ARP Omni and Moog&#x27;s Polymoog and Opus 3.

By 1976 affordable polyphonic synthesizers began to appear, such as the Yamaha CS-50, CS-60 and CS-80, the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and the Oberheim Four-Voice. These remained complex, heavy and relatively costly. The recording of settings in digital memory allowed storage and recall of sounds. The first practical polyphonic synth, and the first to use a microprocessor as a controller, was the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 introduced in late 1977. For the first time, musicians had a practical polyphonic synthesizer that could save all knob settings in computer memory and recall them at the touch of a button. The Prophet-5&#x27;s design paradigm became a new standard, slowly pushing out more complex and recondite modular designs.
== Tape recording ==
In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced magnetic tape recorder, called the &quot;Magnetophon&quot;. Audio tape, which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.

The term &quot;electronic music&quot; (which first came into use during the 1930s) came to include the tape recorder as an essential element: &quot;electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition&quot;. It was also indispensable to Musique concrète.

Tape also gave rise to the first, analogue, sample-playback keyboards, the Chamberlin and its more famous successor the Mellotron, an electro-mechanical, polyphonic keyboard originally developed and built in Birmingham, England in the early 1960s.

== Sound sequencer ==

During the 1940s–1960s, Raymond Scott, an American composer of electronic music, invented various kind of music sequencers for his electric compositions. Step sequencers played rigid patterns of notes using a grid of (usually) 16 buttons, or steps, each step being 1/16 of a measure. These patterns of notes were then chained together to form longer compositions. Software sequencers were continuously utilized since the 1950s in the context of computer music, including computer-&quot;played&quot; music (software sequencer), computer-&quot;composed&quot; music (music synthesis), and computer &quot;sound generation&quot; (sound synthesis).

==Digital era 1980–2000==

===Digital synthesis===

The first digital synthesizers were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers. FM synthesis was developed for this purpose; as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample. In 1983 Yamaha introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the DX-7. It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first developed by John Chowning at Stanford University during the late sixties. Chowning exclusively licensed his FM synthesis patent to Yamaha in 1975. Yamaha subsequently released their first FM synthesizers, the GS-1 and GS-2, which were costly and heavy. There followed a pair of smaller, preset versions, the CE20 and CE25 Combo Ensembles, targeted primarily at the home organ market and featuring four-octave keyboards. Yamaha&#x27;s third generation of digital synthesizers was a commercial success; it consisted of the DX7 and DX9 (1983). Both models were compact, reasonably priced, and dependent on custom digital integrated circuits to produce FM tonalities. The DX7 was the first mass market all-digital synthesizer. It became indispensable to many music artists of the 1980s, and demand soon exceeded supply. The DX7 sold over 200,000 units within three years.

The DX series was not easy to program but offered a detailed, percussive sound that led to the demise of the electro-mechanical Rhodes piano, which was heavier and larger than a DX synth. Following the success of FM synthesis Yamaha signed a contract with Stanford University in 1989 to develop digital waveguide synthesis, leading to the first commercial physical modeling synthesizer, Yamaha&#x27;s VL-1, in 1994. The DX-7 was affordable enough for amateurs and young bands to buy, unlike the costly synthesizers of previous generations, which were mainly used by top professionals.

=== Sampling ===
The Fairlight CMI (Computer Musical Instrument), the first polyphonic digital sampler, was the harbinger of sample-based synthesizers. Designed in 1978 by Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie and based on a dual microprocessor computer designed by Tony Furse in Sydney, Australia, the Fairlight CMI gave musicians the ability to modify volume, attack, decay, and use special effects like vibrato. Sample waveforms could be displayed on-screen and modified using a light pen. The Synclavier from New England Digital was a similar system. Jon Appleton (with Jones and Alonso) invented the Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer, later to become the New England Digital Corp&#x27;s Synclavier. The Kurzweil K250, first produced in 1983, was also a successful polyphonic digital music synthesizer, noted for its ability to reproduce several instruments synchronously and having a velocity-sensitive keyboard.

=== Computer music ===
An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. Iannis Xenakis began what is called &quot;musique stochastique,&quot; or &quot;stochastic music&quot;, which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of glissando for his orchestral composition &quot;Metastasis&quot; (1953–54), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like &quot;ST/4&quot; for string quartet and &quot;ST/48&quot; for orchestra (both 1962).

The impact of computers continued in 1956. Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson composed &quot;Illiac Suite&quot; for string quartet, the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using algorithmic composition.

In 1957, Max Mathews at Bell Lab wrote MUSIC-N series, a first computer program family for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis. Then Barry Vercoe wrote MUSIC 11 based on MUSIC IV-BF, a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into csound, which is still widely used).

In mid 80s, Miller Puckette at IRCAM developed graphic signal-processing software for 4X called Max (after Max Mathews), and later ported it to Macintosh (with Dave Zicarelli extending it for Opcode) for real-time MIDI control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

=== MIDI ===
In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer. This standard was dubbed MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

The advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

== Modern electronic musical instruments ==

The increasing power and decreasing cost of sound-generating electronics (and especially of the personal computer), combined with the standardization of the MIDI and Open Sound Control musical performance description languages, has facilitated the separation of musical instruments into music controllers and music synthesizers.

By far the most common musical controller is the musical keyboard. Other controllers include the radiodrum, Akai&#x27;s EWI and Yamaha&#x27;s WX wind controllers, the guitar-like SynthAxe, the BodySynth, the Buchla Thunder, the Continuum Fingerboard, the Roland Octapad, various isomorphic keyboards including the Thummer, and Kaossilator Pro, and kits like I-CubeX.

===Reactable===
The Reactable is a round translucent table with a backlit interactive display. By placing and manipulating blocks called &quot;tangibles&quot; on the table surface, while interacting with the visual display via finger gestures, a virtual modular synthesizer is operated, creating music or sound effects.

===Percussa AudioCubes===
AudioCubes are autonomous wireless cubes powered by an internal computer system and rechargeable battery. They have internal RGB lighting, and are capable of detecting each other&#x27;s location, orientation and distance. The cubes can also detect distances to the user&#x27;s hands and fingers. Through interaction with the cubes, a variety of music and sound software can be operated. AudioCubes have applications in sound design, music production, DJing and live performance.

===Kaossilator===
The Kaossilator and Kaossilator Pro are compact instruments where the position of a finger on the touch pad controls two note-characteristics; usually the pitch is changed with a left-right motion and the tonal property, filter or other parameter changes with an up-down motion. The touch pad can be set to different musical scales and keys. The instrument can record a repeating loop of adjustable length, set to any tempo, and new loops of sound can be layered on top of existing ones. This lends itself to electronic dance-music but is more limited for controlled sequences of notes, as the pad on a regular Kaossilator is featureless.

===Eigenharp===

The Eigenharp is a large instrument resembling a bassoon, which can be interacted with through big buttons, a drum sequencer and a mouthpiece. The sound processing is done on a separate computer.

===AlphaSphere===

The AlphaSphere is a spherical instrument that consists of 48 tactile pads that respond to pressure as well as touch. Custom software allows the pads to be indefinitely programmed individually or by groups in terms of function, note, and pressure parameter among many other settings. The primary concept of the AlphaSphere is to increase the level of expression available to electronic musicians, by allowing for the playing style of a musical instrument.

==Chip music==
Chiptune, chipmusic, or chip music is music written in sound formats where many of the sound textures are synthesized or sequenced in real time by a computer or video game console sound chip, sometimes including sample-based synthesis and low bit sample playback. Many chip music devices featured synthesizers in tandem with low rate sample playback.

==DIY culture==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, do-it-yourself designs were published in hobby electronics magazines (such the Formant modular synth, a DIY clone of the Moog system, published by Elektor) and kits were supplied by companies such as Paia in the US, and Maplin Electronics in the UK.

===Circuit bending===

In 1966, Reed Ghazala discovered and began to teach math &quot;circuit bending&quot;—the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by John Cage’s aleatoric music concept.

Much of this manipulation of circuits directly, especially to the point of destruction, was pioneered by Louis and Bebe Barron in the early 1950s, such as their work with John Cage on the &quot;Williams Mix&quot; and especially in the soundtrack to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

Modern circuit bending is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children&#x27;s toys and small digital synthesizers to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with &quot;bent&quot; instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and potentiometers that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizer circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to build noise generators such as the Atari Punk Console or the Dub Siren as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the Speak &amp; Spell that are often modified by circuit benders.

===Modular synthesizers===

The modular synthesizer is a type of synthesizer consisting of separate interchangeable modules. These are also available as kits for hobbyist DIY constructors. Many hobbyist designers also make available bare PCB boards and front panels for sale to other hobbyists.

<text>An electrode is an electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e.g. a semiconductor, an electrolyte, a vacuum or a gas). In electrochemical cells, electrodes are essential parts that can consist of a variety of materials (chemicals) depending on the type of cell. An electrode may be called either a cathode or anode according to the direction of the electric current, unrelated to the potential difference between electrodes.

Michael Faraday coined the term &quot;&quot; in 1833; the word recalls the Greek ἤλεκτρον (, &quot;amber&quot;) and ὁδός (, &quot;path, way&quot;).

The electrophore, invented by Johan Wilcke in 1762, was an early version of an electrode used to study static electricity.

== Anode and cathode in electrochemical cells ==
Electrodes are an essential part of any battery. The first electrochemical battery was devised by Alessandro Volta and was aptly named the Voltaic cell. This battery consisted of a stack of copper and zinc electrodes separated by brine-soaked paper disks. Due to fluctuation in the voltage provided by the voltaic cell, it was not very practical. The first practical battery was invented in 1839 and named the Daniell cell after John Frederic Daniell. It still made use of the zinc–copper electrode combination. Since then, many more batteries have been developed using various materials. The basis of all these is still using two electrodes, anodes and cathodes.

=== Anode ===
&#x27;Anode&#x27; was coined by William Whewell at Michael Faraday&#x27;s request, derived from the Greek words ἄνο (ano), &#x27;upwards&#x27; and ὁδός (hodós), &#x27;a way&#x27;. The anode is the electrode through which the conventional current enters from the electrical circuit of an electrochemical cell (battery) into the non-metallic cell. The electrons then flow to the other side of the battery. Benjamin Franklin surmised that the electrical flow moved from positive to negative. The electrons flow away from the anode and the conventional current towards it. From both can be concluded that the electric potential of the anode is negative. The electron entering the anode comes from the oxidation reaction that takes place next to it.

=== Cathode ===
The cathode is in many ways the opposite of the anode. The name (also coined by Whewell) comes from the Greek words κάτω (kato), &#x27;downwards&#x27; and ὁδός (hodós), &#x27;a way&#x27;. It is the positive electrode, meaning the electrons flow from the electrical circuit through the cathode into the non-metallic part of the electrochemical cell. At the cathode, the reduction reaction takes place with the electrons arriving from the wire connected to the cathode and are absorbed by the oxidizing agent.

=== Primary cell ===
A primary cell is a battery designed to be used once and then discarded. This is due to the electrochemical reactions taking place at the electrodes in the cell not being reversible. An example of a primary cell is the discardable alkaline battery commonly used in flashlights. Consisting of a zinc anode and a manganese oxide cathode in which ZnO is formed.
The half-reactions are:
: Zn(s) + 2OH−(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e− formula_1 [&quot;E&quot;0oxidation = −1.28 V]
: 2MnO2(s) + H2O(l) + 2e− → Mn2O3(s) + 2OH−(aq)formula_2 [&quot;E&quot;0reduction = +0.15 V]

Overall reaction:
: Zn(s) + 2MnO2(s) ZnO(s) + Mn2O3(s)formula_1 [&quot;E&quot;0total = +1.43 V]
The ZnO is prone to clumping and will give less efficient discharge if recharged again. It is possible to recharge these batteries but is due to safety concerns advised against by the manufacturer. Other primary cells include zinc–carbon, zinc–chloride, and lithium iron disulfide.

=== Secondary cell ===

Contrary to the primary cell a secondary cell can be recharged. The first was the lead–acid battery, invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté. This type of battery is still the most widely used in automobiles, among others. The cathode consists of lead dioxide (PbO2) and the anode of solid lead. Other commonly used rechargeable batteries are nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride, and Lithium-ion. The last of which will be explained more thoroughly in this article due to its importance.

== Marcus&#x27;s theory of electron transfer ==
Marcus theory is a theory originally developed by Nobel laureate Rudolph A. Marcus and explains the rate at which an electron can move from one chemical species to another, for this article this can be seen as &#x27;jumping&#x27; from the electrode to a species in the solvent or vice versa.
We can represent the problem as calculating the transfer rate for the transfer of an electron from donor to an acceptor 
: D + A → D+ + A−

The potential energy of the system is a function of the translational, rotational, and vibrational coordinates of the reacting species and the molecules of the surrounding medium, collectively called the reaction coordinates. The abscissa the figure to the right represents these. From the classical electron transfer theory, the expression of the reaction rate constant (probability of reaction) can be calculated, if a non-adiabatic process and parabolic potential energy are assumed, by finding the point of intersection (). One important thing to note, and was noted by Marcus when he came up with the theory, the electron transfer must abide by the law of conservation of energy and the Frank-Condon principle. 
Doing this and then rearranging this leads to the expression of the free energy activation () in terms of the overall free energy of the reaction ().

In which the formula_5 is the reorganisation energy.
Filling this result in the classically derived Arrhenius equation
formula_6
leads to
formula_7
with &quot;A&quot; being the pre-exponential factor, which is usually experimentally determined, although a semi-classical derivation provides more information as is explained below.

This classically derived result qualitatively reproduced observations of a maximum electron transfer rate under the conditions . For a more extensive mathematical treatment one could read the paper by Newton. An interpretation of this result and what a closer look at the physical meaning of the formula_8 one can read the paper by Marcus.

The situation at hand can be more accurately described by using the displaced harmonic oscillator model, in this model quantum tunneling is allowed. This is needed in order to explain why even at near-zero absolute temperature there are still electron transfers, in contradiction with the classical theory.

Without going into too much detail on how the derivation is done, it rests on using Fermi&#x27;s golden rule from time-dependent perturbation theory with the full Hamiltonian of the system. It is possible to look at the overlap in the wavefunctions of both the reactants and the products (the right and the left side of the chemical reaction) and therefore when their energies are the same and allow for electron transfer. As touched on before this must happen because only then conservation of energy is abided by. Skipping over a few mathematical steps the probability of electron transfer can be calculated (albeit quite difficult) using the following formula
formula_9

In this equation, &quot;μ&quot; represents the chemical potential, with &quot;μ&quot;o being its reference value. &quot;T&quot; stands for the temperature and &quot;k&quot; the Boltzmann constant. The term &quot;γ&quot; inside the logarithm is the activity and &quot;x&quot; is the ratio of the ion to the total composition of the electrode. The novel term Ω is the partial molar volume of the ion in the host and &quot;σ&quot; corresponds to the mean stress felt by the system. The result of this equation is that diffusion, which is dependent on chemical potential, gets impacted by the added stress and, therefore changes the battery&#x27;s performance. Furthermore, mechanical stresses may also impact the electrode&#x27;s solid-electrolyte-interphase layer. The interface which regulates the ion and charge transfer and can be degraded by stress. Thus, more ions in the solution will be consumed to reform it, diminishing the overall efficiency of the system.

== Other anodes and cathodes ==
In a vacuum tube or a semiconductor having polarity (diodes, electrolytic capacitors) the anode is the positive (+) electrode and the cathode the negative (−). The electrons enter the device through the cathode and exit the device through the anode. Many devices have other electrodes to control operation, e.g., base, gate, control grid.

In a three-electrode cell, a counter electrode, also called an auxiliary electrode, is used only to make a connection to the electrolyte so that a current can be applied to the working electrode. The counter electrode is usually made of an inert material, such as a noble metal or graphite, to keep it from dissolving.

== Welding electrodes ==
In arc welding, an electrode is used to conduct current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, in the case of gas metal arc welding or shielded metal arc welding, or non-consumable, such as in gas tungsten arc welding. For a direct current system, the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder, the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.

== Alternating current electrodes ==
For electrical systems which use alternating current, the electrodes are the connections from the circuitry to the object to be acted upon by the electric current but are not designated anode or cathode because the direction of flow of the electrons changes periodically, usually many times per second.

== Chemically modified electrodes ==
Chemically modified electrodes are electrodes that have their surfaces chemically modified to change the electrode&#x27;s physical, chemical, electrochemical, optical, electrical, and transportive properties. These electrodes are used for advanced purposes in research and investigation.

== Uses ==
Electrodes are used to provide current through nonmetal objects to alter them in numerous ways and to measure conductivity for numerous purposes. Examples include:
* Electrodes for fuel cells
* Electrodes for medical purposes, such as EEG (for recording brain activity), ECG (recording heart beats), ECT (electrical brain stimulation), defibrillator (recording and delivering cardiac stimulation)
* Electrodes for electrophysiology techniques in biomedical research
* Electrodes for execution by the electric chair
* Electrodes for electroplating
* Electrodes for arc welding
* Electrodes for cathodic protection
* Electrodes for grounding
* Electrodes for chemical analysis using electrochemical methods
* Nanoelectrodes for high-precision measurements in nanoelectrochemistry
* Inert electrodes for electrolysis (made of platinum)
* Membrane electrode assembly
* Electrodes for Taser electroshock weapon

<text>An epistolary novel is a novel written as a series of letters between the fictional characters of a narrative. The term is often extended to cover novels that intersperse documents of other kinds with the letters, most commonly diary entries and newspaper clippings, and sometimes considered to include novels composed of documents even if they do not include letters at all. More recently, epistolaries may include electronic documents such as recordings and radio, blog posts, and e-mails. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from Latin from the Greek word (), meaning a letter . This type of fiction is also sometimes known by the German term Briefroman or more generally as epistolary fiction.

The epistolary form can be seen as adding greater realism to a story, due to the text existing diegetically within the lives of the characters. It is in particular able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an omniscient narrator. An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the fictional editor.

==Early works==
There are two theories on the genesis of the epistolary novel: The first claims that the genre originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third-person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced. The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from miscellanies of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot. There is evidence to support both claims. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish &quot;Prison of Love&quot; (&quot;Cárcel de amor&quot;) () by Diego de San Pedro, belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of Edmé Boursault&#x27;s &quot;Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love&quot; (&quot;Lettres de respect, d&#x27;obligation et d&#x27;amour&quot;) (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet were expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled &quot;Letters to Babet&quot; (&quot;Lettres à Babet&quot;). The immensely famous &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun&quot; (&quot;Lettres portugaises&quot;) (1669) generally attributed to Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues, though a small minority still regard Marianna Alcoforado as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry. The founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be James Howell (1594–1666) with &quot;Familiar Letters&quot; (1645–50), who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.

Perhaps first work to fully utilize the potential of an epistolary novel was &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot;. This work was published anonymously in three volumes (1684, 1685, and 1687), and has been attributed to Aphra Behn though its authorship remains disputed in the 21st century. The novel shows the genre&#x27;s results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; further volumes introduced a narrator). The author furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with complex scenarios such as letters that fall into the wrong hands, faked letters, or letters withheld by protagonists.

===18th century to modern era===
The epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as Samuel Richardson, with his immensely successful novels &quot;Pamela&quot; (1740) and &quot;Clarissa&quot; (1749). John Cleland&#x27;s early erotic novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (1748) is written as a series of letters from the titular character to an unnamed recipient. In France, there was &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; (1721) by Montesquieu, followed by &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot; (1761) by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Choderlos de Laclos&#x27; &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In Germany, there was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; (&quot;Die Leiden des jungen Werther&quot;) (1774) and Friedrich Hölderlin&#x27;s &quot;Hyperion&quot;. The first Canadian novel, &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot; (1769) by Frances Brooke, and twenty years later the first American novel, &quot;The Power of Sympathy&quot; (1789) by William Hill Brown, were both written in epistolary form.

Starting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage burlesques. The most notable example of these was Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Shamela&quot; (1741), written as a parody of &quot;Pamela&quot;. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances. Oliver Goldsmith used the form to satirical effect in &quot;The Citizen of the World&quot;, subtitled &quot;Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to his Friends in the East&quot; (1760–61). So did the diarist Fanny Burney in a successful comic first novel, &quot;Evelina&quot; (1788).

The epistolary novel slowly became less popular after 18th century. Although Jane Austen tried the epistolary in juvenile writings and her novella &quot;Lady Susan&quot; (1794), she abandoned this structure for her later work. It is thought that her lost novel &quot;First Impressions&quot;, which was redrafted to become &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, may have been epistolary: &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.

The epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s novel &quot;Letters of Two Brides&quot;, two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17-year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. Mary Shelley employs the epistolary form in her novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man&#x27;s narrative and confessions. Published in 1848, Anne Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is framed as a retrospective letter from one of the main heroes to his friend and brother-in-law with the diary of the eponymous tenant inside it. In the late 19th century, Bram Stoker released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, &quot;Dracula&quot;. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor&#x27;s notes, ship&#x27;s logs, and the like.

The biographic stylings of the Sherlock Holmes adventures by Arthur Conan Doyle have led to the tradition of a &quot;Sherlockian game&quot; among the Sherlock Holmes fandom, where fans discuss the supposed writings of Dr. Watson as though they were a genuine account of a real detective for whom Doyle only acted as a literary agent.

==Types==
Epistolary novels can be categorized based on the number of people whose letters are included. This gives three types of epistolary novels: monophonic (giving the letters of only one character, like &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun&quot; and &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme Marie Jeanne Riccoboni&#x27;s &quot;Letters of Fanni Butler&quot; (1757), and polyphonic (with three or more letter-writing characters, such as in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;).

A crucial element in polyphonic epistolary novels like &quot;Clarissa&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; is the dramatic device of &#x27;discrepant awareness&#x27;: the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension. They can also be classified according to their type and quantity of use of non-letter documents, though this has obvious correlations with the number of voices – for example, newspaper clippings are unlikely to feature heavily in a monophonic epistolary and considerably more likely in a polyphonic one.

==Notable works==

The epistolary novel form has continued to be used after the eighteenth century.

=== Eighteenth century ===
* &quot;Lettres persanes&quot;, a 1721 novel by Montesquieu.
* &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot;, by Samuel Richardson 1740, a bestselling early epistolary novel which prompted artistic interest in the epistolary form.
* &quot;Julie; or, The New Heloise&quot;, an epistolary novel by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, published in 1761.
* &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; is a 1774 novel by Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
* &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; is a 1782 French novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, about the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, two narcissistic rivals (and ex-lovers) who use seduction as a weapon to socially control and exploit others, all the while enjoying their cruel games and boasting about their talent for manipulation (also seen as depicting the corruption and depravity of the French nobility shortly before the French Revolution). The book is composed entirely of letters written by the various characters to each other.
* &quot;Cartas marruecas&quot; (&quot;Moroccan Letters&quot;), a 1789 novel by José Cadalso, Spanish author, poet, playwright and essayist.
* Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;Aline and Valcour&quot; (1795).

=== Nineteenth century ===
* Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) uses a frame story written in the form of letters, with the main narrative being told as a first person account by the titular character.
* Fyodor Dostoevsky used the epistolary format for his first novel, &quot;Poor Folk&quot; (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in Imperial-era Russia.
* &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1848) by English author Anne Brontë is framed as a series of letters and diary entries.
* &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868) by Wilkie Collins uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of the eponymous diamond might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element, as most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered. He also used the form previously in &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1859).
* Spanish foreign minister Juan Valera&#x27;s &quot;Pepita Jiménez&quot; (1874) is written in three sections, the first and third being a series of letters, the middle part narrated by an unknown observer.
* Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) uses not only letters and diaries, but also dictation cylinders and newspaper accounts.

=== Twentieth century ===
* Dorothy L. Sayers and Robert Eustace&#x27;s &quot;The Documents in the Case&quot; (1930).
* E.M. Delafield&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Provincial Lady&quot; (1930).
* Kathrine Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Address Unknown&quot; (1938) is an anti-Nazi novel in which the final letter is returned marked &quot;Address Unknown&quot;, indicating the disappearance of the German character.
* C. S. Lewis used the epistolary form for &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; (1942), and considered writing a companion novel from an angel&#x27;s point of view – though he never did so. It is less generally realized that his &quot;Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer&quot; (1964) is a similar exercise, exploring theological questions through correspondence addressed to a fictional recipient, &quot;Malcolm&quot;, though this work may be considered a &quot;novel&quot; only loosely in that developments in Malcolm&#x27;s personal life gradually come to light and impact the discussion.
* Thornton Wilder&#x27;s fifth novel &quot;Ides of March&quot; (1948) consists of letters and documents illuminating the last days of the Roman Republic.
* Saul Bellow&#x27;s novel &quot;Herzog&quot; (1964) is largely written in letter format. These are both real and imagined letters, written by the protagonist Moses Herzog to family members, friends, and celebrities.
* Shūsaku Endō&#x27;s novel &quot;Silence&quot; (1966) is an example of the epistolary form, half of which consists of letters from Rodrigues, the other half either in the third person or in letters from other persons.
* Daniel Keyes&#x27;s short story and novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; (1959, 1966) takes the form of a series of lab progress reports written by the main character as his treatment progresses, with his writing style changing correspondingly.
* &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; (1969, 1970) by Lawrence Sanders is a novel primarily consisting of transcripts of tape recordings.
* Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Carrie&quot; (1974) is partially written in an epistolary structure through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and book excerpts.
* Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, 1985, ends with an epilogue consisting of the minutes from the meeting of a historical society in the future discussing the text of the novel, revealed to have been recently transcribed from a series of cassette tape recordings made by the protagonist Offred.

* Alice Walker employed the epistolary form in &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1982). The 1985 film adaptation echoes the form by incorporating into the script some of the novel&#x27;s letters, which the actors deliver as monologues.
* John Updike&#x27;s &quot;S.&quot; (1988) is an epistolary novel consisting of the heroine&#x27;s letters and transcribed audio recordings.
* Patricia Wrede and Caroline Stevermer&#x27;s &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia&quot; (1988) is an epistolary fantasy novel in a Regency setting from the first-person perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia, who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. Unusually for modern fiction, it is written using the style of the letter game.

=== Twenty-first century ===

* &quot;Between Friends&quot; by Debbie Macomber (2001) tells the story of a lifelong friendship between Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski from the 1950s to the early 2000s, using a combination of letters (later becoming emails) and daily paraphernalia like a gas station receipt. 
* Mark Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; (2001) is a progressively lipogrammatic epistolary novel – the letters become increasingly more difficult to read as the lipogrammatic constraints are brought in, and this requires the reader to attempt to interpret what is being written.
* &quot;La silla del águila&quot; (&quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Throne&quot;) by Carlos Fuentes (2003) is a political satire written as a series of letters between persons in high levels of the Mexican government in 2020. The epistolary format is treated by the author as a consequence of necessity: the United States impedes all telecommunications in Mexico as a retaliatory measure, leaving letters and smoke signals as the only possible methods of communication, particularly ironic given one character&#x27;s observation that &quot;Mexican politicians put nothing in writing.&quot;
* &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot; by Lionel Shriver (2003) is a monologic epistolary novel written as a series of letters from Eva, Kevin&#x27;s mother, to her husband Franklin.
* &quot;The Sluts&quot; (2004) by Dennis Cooper is composed of online posts, reviews and email correspondence. Each contributes to a central mystery, fuelled by competing narratives about an escort. 
* The 2004 novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; by David Mitchell tells a story in several time periods in a nested format, with some sections told in epistolary style, including an interview, journal entries and a series of letters.
*&quot;March&quot; (2005), by Geraldine Brooks, is a novel depicting the events of the protagonist&#x27;s experiences during the American Civil War in 1862 through letters.
* &quot;World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War&quot; (2006), by Max Brooks, is a series of interviews from various survivors of a zombie apocalypse.
*&quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot; (2007) by Paul Torday, is a series of letters, e-mails, interview transcripts, newspaper articles and other non-narrative media.
* &quot;The White Tiger&quot; (2008) by Aravind Adiga, winner of the 40th Man Booker Prize in 2008, is a novel in the form of letters written by an Indian villager to the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
* &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&quot; (2008), by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, is written as a series of letters and telegraphs sent and received by the protagonist.
* &quot;A Visit from the Goon Squad&quot; (2010) by Jennifer Egan has parts which are epistolary in nature. One chapter is written as a report of a celebrity interview, and another as a PowerPoint presentation.
* &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go, Bernadette&quot; (2012) by Maria Semple is told in a series of documents such as emails, memos and transcripts.
* &quot;Illuminae&quot;, by Jay Kristoff and Amie Kaufmann, is told exclusively through a series of classified documents, censored emails, interviews, and others.

<text>Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is &quot;the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.&quot; The aim of EBM is to integrate the experience of the clinician, the values of the patient, and the best available scientific information to guide decision-making about clinical management. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.

The EBM Pyramid is a tool that helps in visualizing the hierarchy of evidence in medicine, from least authoritative, like expert opinions, to most authoritative, like systematic reviews.

Adoption of evidence-based medicine is necessary in a human rights-based approach to public health and a precondition for accessing the right to health.

== Background, history, and definition ==
Medicine has a long history of scientific inquiry about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. In the 11th century AD, Avicenna, a Persian physician and philosopher, developed an approach to EBM that was mostly similar to current ideas and practises.

The concept of a controlled clinical trial was first described in 1662 by Jan Baptist van Helmont in reference to the practice of bloodletting. Wrote Van Helmont:
The first published report describing the conduct and results of a controlled clinical trial was by James Lind, a Scottish naval surgeon who conducted research on scurvy during his time aboard HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot; in the Channel Fleet, while patrolling the Bay of Biscay. Lind divided the sailors participating in his experiment into six groups, so that the effects of various treatments could be fairly compared. Lind found improvement in symptoms and signs of scurvy among the group of men treated with lemons or oranges. He published a treatise describing the results of this experiment in 1753.

An early critique of statistical methods in medicine was published in 1835, in Comtes Rendus de l’Académie des Sciences, Paris, by a man referred to as &quot;Mr Civiale&quot;.

In 1990, Gordon Guyatt, then a young internal medicine residency coordinator at McMaster University, introduced a teaching method he initially termed &quot;Scientific Medicine.&quot; This approach emphasized applying critical appraisal techniques directly to bedside clinical decision-making, building on the work of his mentor, David Sackett. However, the concept met resistance from colleagues, as it implied that existing clinical practices lacked scientific rigor, even though this was likely true. To address this, Guyatt rebranded the approach as &quot;Evidence-Based Medicine&quot;, a term first formally introduced in a 1991 editorial in the ACP Journal Club. Although the name was coined in 1991, it took several years after and a concerted efforts of many other teams to define the foundations of this method.

Although more popular in medicine, the concept of &quot;evidence-based&quot; is spreading to other disciplines, such as the humanities, and to languages other than English, albeit at a slower pace.

=== Clinical decision-making ===
Alvan Feinstein&#x27;s publication of &quot;Clinical Judgment&quot; in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it. In 1972, Archie Cochrane published &quot;Effectiveness and Efficiency&quot;, which described the lack of controlled trials supporting many practices that had previously been assumed to be effective. In 1973, John Wennberg began to document wide variations in how physicians practiced. Through the 1980s, David M. Eddy described errors in clinical reasoning and gaps in evidence. In the mid-1980s, Alvin Feinstein, David Sackett and others published textbooks on clinical epidemiology, which translated epidemiological methods to physician decision-making. Toward the end of the 1980s, a group at RAND showed that large proportions of procedures performed by physicians were considered inappropriate even by the standards of their own experts.

=== Evidence-based guidelines and policies ===

David M. Eddy first began to use the term &#x27;evidence-based&#x27; in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was eventually published by the American College of Physicians. Eddy first published the term &#x27;evidence-based&#x27; in March 1990, in an article in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&quot; that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as &quot;explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence instead of standard-of-care practices or the beliefs of experts. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written.&quot; He discussed evidence-based policies in several other papers published in &quot;JAMA&quot; in the spring of 1990. Those papers were part of a series of 28 published in &quot;JAMA&quot; between 1990 and 1997 on formal methods for designing population-level guidelines and policies.

=== Medical education ===
The term &#x27;evidence-based medicine&#x27; was introduced slightly later, in the context of medical education. In the autumn of 1990, Gordon Guyatt used it in an unpublished description of a program at McMaster University for prospective or new medical students. Guyatt and others first published the term two years later (1992) to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine.

In 1996, David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as &quot;the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.&quot; This branch of evidence-based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research. Population-based data are applied to the care of an individual patient, while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients&#x27; predicaments, rights, and preferences.

Between 1993 and 2000, the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 &quot;Users&#x27; Guides to the Medical Literature&quot; in &quot;JAMA&quot;. In 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined individual-level, evidence-based medicine as &quot;the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions.&quot; In 2010, Greenhalgh used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: &quot;the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients.&quot;

The two original definitions highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals. When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings with relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians, evidence-based policymaking emphasizes that good evidence should exist to document a test&#x27;s or treatment&#x27;s effectiveness. In the setting of individual decision-making, practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment. In 2005, Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM: &quot;Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit.&quot;

=== Progress ===
In the area of evidence-based guidelines and policies, the explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence-based principles in 1984. In 1985, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence-based criteria for covering new technologies. Beginning in 1987, specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians, and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association, wrote many evidence-based guidelines. In 1991, Kaiser Permanente, a managed care organization in the US, began an evidence-based guidelines program. In 1991, Richard Smith wrote an editorial in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and introduced the ideas of evidence-based policies in the UK. In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration created a network of 13 countries to produce systematic reviews and guidelines. In 1997, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, then known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, or AHCPR) established Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to produce evidence reports and technology assessments to support the development of guidelines. In the same year, a National Guideline Clearinghouse that followed the principles of evidence-based policies was created by AHRQ, the AMA, and the American Association of Health Plans (now America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans). In 1999, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was created in the UK.

In the area of medical education, medical schools in Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries now offer programs that teach evidence-based medicine. A 2009 study of UK programs found that more than half of UK medical schools offered some training in evidence-based medicine, although the methods and content varied considerably, and EBM teaching was restricted by lack of curriculum time, trained tutors and teaching materials. Many programs have been developed to help individual physicians gain better access to evidence. For example, UpToDate was created in the early 1990s. The Cochrane Collaboration began publishing evidence reviews in 1993. In 1995, BMJ Publishing Group launched Clinical Evidence, a 6-monthly periodical that provided brief summaries of the current state of evidence about important clinical questions for clinicians.

=== Current practice ===
By 2000, use of the term &quot;evidence-based&quot; had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is evidence-based health services, which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.

The multiple tributaries of evidence-based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However, because they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promoting a guideline or payment policy, a distinction is sometimes made between evidence-based medicine and science-based medicine, which also takes into account factors such as prior plausibility and compatibility with established science (as when medical organizations promote controversial treatments such as acupuncture). Differences also exist regarding the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily &quot;hybridise&quot; with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises. The most effective &quot;knowledge leaders&quot; (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence. Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for governmentality in health care, and consequently play a central role in the governance of contemporary health care systems.

== Methods ==

=== Steps ===
The steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results (meta-analysis); summarize the evidence in evidence tables; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a balance sheet; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.

For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992 and the experience of delegates attending the 2003 Conference of Evidence-Based Health Care Teachers and Developers was summarized into five steps and published in 2005. This five-step process can broadly be categorized as follows:

# Translation of uncertainty to an answerable question; includes critical questioning, study design and levels of evidence
# Systematic retrieval of the best evidence available
# Critical appraisal of evidence for internal validity that can be broken down into aspects regarding:
#* Systematic errors as a result of selection bias, information bias and confounding
#* Quantitative aspects of diagnosis and treatment
#* The effect size and aspects regarding its precision
#* Clinical importance of results
#* External validity or generalizability
# Application of results in practice
# Evaluation of performance

=== Evidence reviews ===
Systematic reviews of published research studies are a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments. The Cochrane Collaboration is one of the best-known organisations that conducts systematic reviews. Like other producers of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed study protocol as well as a reproducible plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence. After the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as (1) likely to be beneficial, (2) likely to be harmful, or (3) without evidence to support either benefit or harm.

A 2007 analysis of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial, 7% concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful, and 49% concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research. In 2017, a study assessed the role of systematic reviews produced by Cochrane Collaboration to inform US private payers&#x27; policymaking; it showed that although the medical policy documents of major US private payers were informed by Cochrane systematic reviews, there was still scope to encourage the further use.

=== Assessing the quality of evidence ===

Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of randomized, well-blinded, placebo-controlled trials with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, and difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion &quot;does not belong in the rankings of the quality of empirical evidence because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence&quot; and continue that &quot;expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone.&quot;).

Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following system:
* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.
* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.
* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort studies or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple time series designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.
* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

Another example are the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. First released in September 2000, the Levels of Evidence provide a way to rank evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels were Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make them more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients and clinicians, as well as by experts to develop clinical guidelines, such as recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in psoriasis and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring hepatocellular carcinoma in Canada.

In 2000, a system was developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. The GRADE system takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research. It requires users who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables assign one of four levels to evaluate the quality of evidence, on the basis of their confidence that the observed effect (a numeric value) is close to the true effect. The confidence value is based on judgments assigned in five different domains in a structured manner. The GRADE working group defines &#x27;quality of evidence&#x27; and &#x27;strength of recommendations&#x27; based on the quality as two different concepts that are commonly confused with each other.

Systematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high but can be downgraded in five different domains.
* Risk of bias: A judgment made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect.
* Imprecision: A judgment made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.
* Indirectness: A judgment made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.
* Inconsistency: A judgment made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.
* Publication bias: A judgment made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.

In the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts off lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.
* Large effect: Methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.
* Plausible confounding would change the effect: Despite the presence of a possible confounding factor that is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.
* Dose response gradient: The intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.

Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:
* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the presented estimate lies very close to the true value. In other words, the probability is very low that further research will completely change the presented conclusions.
* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. In other words, further research may completely change the conclusions.
* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate, and the true value may be substantially different. In other words, further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.
* Very Low Quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. In other words, new research will probably change the presented conclusions completely.

=== Categories of recommendations ===
In guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses the following system:
* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the clinical service provides benefits, but the balance between benefits and risks is too close for general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless individual considerations apply.
* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweigh potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.
* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.

GRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).

Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal

=== Statistical measures ===
Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:
* Likelihood ratio The pre-test odds of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the post-test odds. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects Bayes&#x27; theorem. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.
* AUC-ROC The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between sensitivity and specificity for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.
* Number needed to treat (NNT)/Number needed to harm (NNH). NNT and NNH are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order for 1 additional patient to survive because of the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1,339 women age 50–59 need to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer, then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.

=== Quality of clinical trials ===
Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.
* Trial design considerations: High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.
* Generalizability considerations: Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.
* Follow-up: Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the prospective study outcomes and the statistical power of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.
* Power: A mathematical calculation can determine whether the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.

== Limitations and criticism ==
There are a number of limitations and criticisms of evidence-based medicine. Two widely cited categorization schemes for the various published critiques of EBM include the three-fold division of Straus and McAlister (&quot;limitations universal to the practice of medicine, limitations unique to evidence-based medicine and misperceptions of evidence-based-medicine&quot;) and the five-point categorization of Cohen, Stavri and Hersh (EBM is a poor philosophic basis for medicine, defines evidence too narrowly, is not evidence-based, is limited in usefulness when applied to individual patients, or reduces the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship).

In no particular order, some published objections include:
* Research produced by EBM, such as from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), may not be relevant for all treatment situations. Research tends to focus on specific populations, but individual persons can vary substantially from population norms. Because certain population segments have been historically under-researched (due to reasons such as race, gender, age, and co-morbid diseases), evidence from RCTs may not be generalizable to those populations. Thus, EBM applies to groups of people, but this should not preclude clinicians from using their personal experience in deciding how to treat each patient. One author advises that &quot;the knowledge gained from clinical research does not directly answer the primary clinical question of what is best for the patient at hand&quot; and suggests that evidence-based medicine should not discount the value of clinical experience. Another author stated that &quot;the practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.&quot;
* Use of evidence-based guidelines often fits poorly for complex, multimorbid patients. This is because the guidelines are usually based on clinical studies focused on single diseases. In reality, the recommended treatments in such circumstances may interact unfavorably with each other and often lead to polypharmacy.
* The theoretical ideal of EBM (that every narrow clinical question, of which hundreds of thousands can exist, would be answered by meta-analysis and systematic reviews of multiple RCTs) faces the limitation that research (especially the RCTs themselves) is expensive; thus, in reality, for the foreseeable future, the demand for EBM will always be much higher than the supply, and the best humanity can do is to triage the application of scarce resources.
* Research can be influenced by biases such as political or belief bias, publication bias and conflict of interest in academic publishing. For example, studies with conflicts due to industry funding are more likely to favor their product. It has been argued that contemporary evidence based medicine is an illusion, since evidence based medicine has been corrupted by corporate interests, failed regulation, and commercialisation of academia.
* Systematic Reviews methodologies are capable of bias and abuse in respect of (i) choice of inclusion criteria (ii) choice of outcome measures, comparisons and analyses (iii) the subjectivity inevitable in Risk of Bias assessments, even when codified procedures and criteria are observed. An example of all these problems can be seen in a Cochrane Review, as analyzed by Edmund J. Fordham, et al. in their relevant review.
* A lag exists between when the RCT is conducted and when its results are published.
* A lag exists between when results are published and when they are properly applied.
* Hypocognition (the absence of a simple, consolidated mental framework into which new information can be placed) can hinder the application of EBM.
* Values: while patient values are considered in the original definition of EBM, the importance of values is not commonly emphasized in EBM training, a potential problem under current study.

A 2018 study, &quot;Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results&quot;, assessed the 10 most cited RCTs and argued that trials face a wide range of biases and constraints, from trials only being able to study a small set of questions amenable to randomisation and generally only being able to assess the &quot;average&quot; treatment effect of a sample, to limitations in extrapolating results to another context, among many others outlined in the study.

== Application of evidence in clinical settings ==
Despite the emphasis on evidence-based medicine, unsafe or ineffective medical practices continue to be applied, because of patient demand for tests or treatments, because of failure to access information about the evidence, or because of the rapid pace of change in the scientific evidence. For example, between 2003 and 2017, the evidence shifted on hundreds of medical practices, including whether hormone replacement therapy was safe, whether babies should be given certain vitamins, and whether antidepressant drugs are effective in people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Even when the evidence unequivocally shows that a treatment is either not safe or not effective, it may take many years for other treatments to be adopted.

There are many factors that contribute to lack of uptake or implementation of evidence-based recommendations. These include lack of awareness at the individual clinician or patient (micro) level, lack of institutional support at the organisation level (meso) level or higher at the policy (macro) level. In other cases, significant change can require a generation of physicians to retire or die and be replaced by physicians who were trained with more recent evidence.

Physicians may also reject evidence that conflicts with their anecdotal experience or because of cognitive biases – for example, a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome (the availability heuristic), such as a patient dying after refusing treatment. They may overtreat to &quot;do something&quot; or to address a patient&#x27;s emotional needs. They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends. They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible.

It is the responsibility of those developing clinical guidelines to include an implementation plan to facilitate uptake. The implementation process will include an implementation plan, analysis of the context, identifying barriers and facilitators and designing the strategies to address them.

== Education ==
Training in evidence based medicine is offered across the continuum of medical education. Educational competencies have been created for the education of health care professionals.

The Berlin questionnaire and the Fresno Test are validated instruments for assessing the effectiveness of education in evidence-based medicine. These questionnaires have been used in diverse settings.

A Campbell systematic review that included 24 trials examined the effectiveness of e-learning in improving evidence-based health care knowledge and practice. It was found that e-learning, compared to no learning, improves evidence-based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour. No difference in outcomes is present when comparing e-learning with face-to-face learning. Combining e-learning and face-to-face learning (blended learning) has a positive impact on evidence-based knowledge, skills, attitude and behavior. As a form of e-learning, some medical school students engage in editing Wikipedia to increase their EBM skills, and some students construct EBM materials to develop their skills in communicating medical knowledge.

<doc id="10016" wikidata="Q1234374" url="?curid=10016" title="End zone">
<text>The end zone is the scoring area on the field, according to gridiron-based codes of football. It is the area between the end line and goal line bounded by the sidelines. There are two end zones, each being on the opposite side of the field. It is bordered on all sides by a white line indicating its beginning and end points, with orange, square pylons placed at each of the four corners as a visual aid (however, prior to around the early 1970s, flags were used instead to denote the end zone). Canadian rule books use the terms &quot;goal area&quot; and &quot;dead line&quot; instead of &quot;end zone&quot; and &quot;end line&quot; respectively, but the latter terms are the more common in colloquial Canadian English. Unlike sports like association football and ice hockey which require the ball/puck to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score, both Canadian and American football merely need any part of the ball to break the vertical plane of the outer edge of the goal line.

A similar concept exists in both rugby football codes, where it is known as the &quot;in-goal area&quot;. The difference between rugby and gridiron-based codes is that in rugby, the ball must be touched to the ground in the in-goal area to count as a try (the rugby equivalent of a touchdown), whereas in the gridiron-based games, simply possessing the ball in or over the end zone is sufficient to count as a touchdown.

Ultimate frisbee also uses an end zone scoring area. Scores in this sport are counted when a pass is received in the end zone.

== History ==
The end zones were invented as a result of the legalization of the forward pass in gridiron football. Prior to this, the goal line and end line were the same, and players scored a touchdown by leaving the field of play through that line. Goal posts were placed on the goal line, and any kicks that did not result in field goals but left the field through the end lines were simply recorded as touchbacks (or, in the Canadian game, singles; it was during the pre-end zone era that Hugh Gall set the record for most singles in a game, with eight).

In the earliest days of the forward pass, the pass had to be caught in-bounds and could not be thrown across the goal line (as the receiver would be out of bounds). This also made it difficult to pass the ball when very close to one&#x27;s own goal line, since merely dropping back to pass or kick would result in a safety (rules of the forward pass at the time required the passer to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage, which would make throwing the forward pass when the ball was snapped from behind one&#x27;s own five-yard line illegal in itself).

Thus, in 1912, the end zone was introduced in American football. In an era when professional football was still in its early years and college football dominated the game, the resulting enlargement of the field was constrained by fact that many college teams were already playing in well-developed stadiums, complete with stands and other structures at the ends of the fields, thereby making any substantial enlargement of the field unfeasible at many schools. Eventually, a compromise was reached: 12 yards of end zone were added to each end of the field, but in return, the playing field was shortened from 110 yards to 100, resulting in the physical size of the field being only slightly longer than before. Goal posts were originally kept on the goal lines, but after they began to interfere with play, they moved back to the end lines in 1927, where they have remained in college football ever since. The National Football League moved the goal posts up to the goal line again in 1933, then back again to the end line in 1974.
As with many other aspects of gridiron football, Canadian football adopted the forward pass and end zones much later than American football. The forward pass and end zones were adopted in 1929. In Canada, college football has never reached a level of prominence comparable to U.S. college football, and professional football was still in its infancy in the 1920s. As a result, Canadian football was still being played in rudimentary facilities in the late 1920s. A further consideration was that the Canadian Rugby Union (the governing body of Canadian football at the time, now known as Football Canada) wanted to reduce the prominence of single points (then called &quot;rouges&quot;) in the game. Therefore, the CRU simply appended 25-yard end zones to the ends of the existing 110-yard field, creating a much larger field of play. Since moving the goal posts back 25 yards would have made the scoring of field goals excessively difficult, and since the CRU did not want to reduce the prominence of field goals, the goal posts were left on the goal line where they remain today. However, the rules governing the scoring of singles were changed: teams were required to either kick the ball out of bounds through the end zone or force the opposition to down a kicked ball in their own end zone in order to be awarded a point. By 1986, at which point CFL stadiums were becoming bigger and comparable in development to their American counterparts in an effort to stay financially competitive, the CFL reduced the depth of the end zone to 20 yards.

== Scoring ==
A team scores a touchdown by entering its opponent&#x27;s end zone while carrying the ball or catching the ball while being within the end zone. If the ball is carried by a player, it is considered a score when any part of the ball is directly above or beyond any part of the goal line between the pylons. In addition, a two-point conversion may be scored after a touchdown by the same means.

In Ultimate Frisbee, a goal is scored by completing a pass into the end zone.

== Size ==
The end zone in American football is 10 yards long by yards (160 feet) wide.
A full-sized end zone in Canadian football is 20 yards long by 65 yards wide. Prior to the 1980s, the Canadian end zone was 25 yards long. The first stadium to use the 20-yard-long end zone was B.C. Place in Vancouver, which was completed in 1983. The floor of B.C. Place was (and is) too short to accommodate a field 160 yards in length. The shorter end zone proved popular enough that the CFL adopted it league-wide in 1986. At BMO Field, home to the Toronto Argonauts, the end zones are only 18 yards. Like their American counterparts, Canadian endzones are marked with four pylons.

In Canadian football stadiums that also feature a running track, it is usually necessary to truncate the back corners of the end zones, since a rectangular field 150 yards long and 65 yards wide will not fit completely inside an oval-shaped running track. Such truncations are marked as straight diagonal lines, resulting in an end zone with six corners and six pylons. As of 2019, Montreal&#x27;s Percival Molson Stadium is the only CFL stadium that has the rounded-off end zones.

During the CFL&#x27;s failed American expansion in the mid-1990s, several stadiums, by necessity, used 15-yard end zones (some had end zones that were even shorter than 15 yards); only Baltimore and San Antonio had the endzones at the standard 20 yards.

Ultimate Frisbee uses an end zone 40 yards wide and 20 yards deep (37 m × 18 m).

== The goal post ==

The location and dimensions of a goal post differ from league to league, but it is usually within the boundaries of the end zone. In earlier football games (both professional and collegiate), the goal post began at the goal line, and was usually an H-shaped bar. Nowadays, for player safety reasons, almost all goal posts in the professional and collegiate levels of American football are T-shaped (resembling a slingshot), and reside just outside the rear of both end zones; such goalposts, first seen in 1966, were invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The goal posts in Canadian football still reside on the goal line instead of the back of the end zones, partly because the number of field goal attempts would dramatically decrease if the posts were moved 20 yards back in that sport, and also because the larger end zone and wider field makes the resulting interference in play by the goal post a less serious problem.

At the high school level, it is not uncommon to see multi-purpose goal posts that include football goal posts at the top and a soccer net at the bottom; these are usually seen at smaller schools and in multi-purpose stadiums where facilities are used for multiple sports. When these or H-shaped goal posts are used in football, the lower portions of the posts are covered with several inches of heavy foam padding to protect the safety of the players.

== Livery ==

Most professional and collegiate teams have their logo (livery), team name, or both painted on the surface of the end zone, with team colors filling the background. Many championship and bowl games at college and professional level are commemorated by the names of the opposing teams each being painted in one of the opposite end zones. In some leagues, along with bowl games, local, national, or bowl game sponsors may also have their logos placed in the end zone. In the CFL, fully painted end zones are nonexistent, though some feature club logos or sponsors. Additionally, the Canadian end zone, being a live-ball part of the field, often features yardage dashes (usually marked every five yards), not unlike the field of play itself.

In many places, particularly in smaller high schools and colleges, end zones are undecorated, or have plain white diagonal stripes spaced several yards apart, in lieu of colors and decorations. One notable use of this design in major college football is the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who have both end zones at Notre Dame Stadium painted with nine diagonal 42º white lines at each end signifying Notre Dame&#x27;s founding in 1842 (eighteen lines at 42º) and directed towards the Main Building and its golden dome. In professional football, since 2004, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL have the south end zone at Acrisure Stadium (formerly Heinz Field) painted with diagonal-lines during most of the regular season, with the north end zone featuring only the city name of Pittsburgh in yellow. This is done because Acrisure Stadium, which has a natural grass playing surface, is also home to the Pittsburgh Panthers of college football and the markings simplify field conversion between the two teams&#x27; respective field markings and logos, with both teams sharing a secondary yellow color, but each having different primary colors. After the Panthers&#x27; season is over, the Steelers logo is painted in the south end zone.

Likewise, some end zones are painted in tribute to a recently deceased team figure or fan, as is done with the Steelers&#x27; AFC North rival Baltimore Ravens at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, where the city name is painted as usual in the end zone, except for the &quot;MO&quot; portion, which is painted in gold, white or black in tribute to the late Mo Gaba, a young fan of both the Ravens and Orioles.

One of the major quirks of the American Football League was its use of unusual patterns such as argyle in its end zones, a tradition revived in 2009 by the Denver Broncos to celebrate the team&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Denver itself a former AFL team. The original XFL standardized its playing fields so that all eight of its teams had uniform fields with the XFL logo in each end zone and no team identification.

<text>Ettore Ximenes (11 April 1855 20 December 1926) was an Italian sculptor.

== Biography==
Ettore Ximenes was born 11 April 1855 in Palermo, Italy. Son of Antonio Ximenes and Giulia Tolentino, a Sicilian noble woman, Ettore Ximenes initially embarked on literary studies but then took up sculpture and attended the courses at the Palermo Academy of Fine Arts. After 1872, he continued training at the Naples Academy under Domenico Morelli and Stanislao Lista. He also established a close relationship with Vincenzo Gemito.
He returned to Palermo in 1874 and won a competition for a four-year grant, which enabled him to study and open a studio for sculpture in Florence. In 1873 at Vienna, he exhibited &quot;Work without Genius&quot;. In 1877 at Naples, he exhibited a life-size statue titled &quot;The Equilibrium&quot; about a gymnast walking on a sphere. He would make copies of this work in small marble and bronze statuettes.

He exhibited a stucco &quot;Christ and the Adultress&quot; and &quot;Il cuore del re (Heart of the King)&quot;, the latter depicting an oft-repeated story of King Vittorio Emanuele during one of his frequent hunts, encountering and offering charity to a peasant child. At the 1878 Paris World Exposition he displayed: &quot;The Brawl&quot; and &quot;il Marmiton&quot;. In Paris, he met with Auguste Rodin and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.

In 1878, he also completed a life-size stucco of &quot;il Ciceruacchio&quot;, a statue of the Italian patriot Angelo Brunetti and his thirteen-year-old son, depicting them at the moment of their execution in 1849 by Austrian troops. The Cicervacchio statue, with its tinge of revolutionary zeal, did not find commissions for completing the work in marble.He then completed a nude statue of &quot;Nanà&quot; based on the novel by Émile Zola; the statue was exhibited at the 1879 Salon di Paris. The next year at the Paris Salon, he displayed &quot;La Pesca meravigliosa&quot;, where a fisherman rescues a bathing maiden. Returning to Italy, he displayed the bust del minister Giuseppe Zanardelli. At the Mostra of Rome, he displayed &quot;The assassination of Julius Caesar&quot;; and at the Exposition of Venice, &quot;Ragazzi messi in fila&quot;. Ximenes&#x27; realism gave way to Symbolist and Neo-Renaissance elements. In addition to sculpture, he also produced illustrations for the works of Edmondo De Amicis published by the Treves publishing house.

Ximenes was involved in many of the major official monumental projects in Italy from the 1880s on and devoted his energies as from 1911 primarily to commissions for important public works in São Paulo, Kyiv, New York and Buenos Aires.

<text>Edsger Wybe Dijkstra ( ; ; 11 May 1930 – 6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist, programmer, software engineer, mathematician, and science essayist.

Born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Dijkstra studied mathematics and physics and then theoretical physics at the University of Leiden. Adriaan van Wijngaarden offered him a job as the first computer programmer in the Netherlands at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, where he worked from 1952 until 1962. He formulated and solved the shortest path problem in 1956, and in 1960 developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 in conjunction with colleague Jaap A. Zonneveld. In 1962 he moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven. In the late 1960s he built the THE multiprogramming system, which influenced the designs of subsequent systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory. Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation as its sole research fellow in August 1973. The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the &quot;EWD&quot; series, most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.

Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, working in Austin, USA, until his retirement in November 1999. He and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in Nuenen, where he died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.
He received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing structured programming languages. Shortly before his death, he received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year, in his honor.

== Life and works ==

===Early years===
Edsger W. Dijkstra was born in Rotterdam. His father was a chemist who was president of the Dutch Chemical Society; he taught chemistry at a secondary school and was later its superintendent. His mother was a mathematician, but never had a formal job.

Dijkstra had considered a career in law and had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the United Nations. However, after graduating from school in 1948, at his parents&#x27; suggestion he studied mathematics and physics and then theoretical physics at the University of Leiden.

In the early 1950s, electronic computers were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career by accident, and through his supervisor, Professor , he met Adriaan van Wijngaarden, the director of the Computation Department at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, who offered Dijkstra a job; he officially became the Netherlands&#x27; first &quot;programmer&quot; in March 1952.

Dijkstra remained committed to physics for some time, working on it in Leiden three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:

When Dijkstra married Maria &quot;Ria&quot; C. Debets in 1957, he was required as a part of the marriage rites to state his profession. He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession then in The Netherlands.
In 1959, he received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam for a thesis entitled &#x27;Communication with an Automatic Computer&#x27;, devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the Electrologica X1. His thesis supervisor was Van Wijngaarden.

===Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam===
From 1952 until 1962, Dijkstra worked at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, where he worked closely with Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.
Dijkstra formulated and solved the shortest path problem for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956. Because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing, he did not publish the result until 1959.

At the Mathematical Centre, Dijkstra and his colleague developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 by August 1960, more than a year before a compiler was produced by another group. ALGOL 60 is known as a key advance in the rise of structured programming.

===Eindhoven University of Technology===

In 1962, Dijkstra moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, in the south of the Netherlands, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department. In the late 1960s, he built the THE operating system (named for the university, then known as Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven), which has influenced the designs of subsequent operating systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory.

===Burroughs Corporation===
Dijkstra joined the Burroughs Corporation—a company known then for producing computers based on an innovative hardware architecture—as its research fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the firm&#x27;s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous &#x27;Tuesday Afternoon Club&#x27;, a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects: notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new &#x27;branch&#x27; of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin, Texas.

The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.

===The University of Texas at Austin===

Dijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984.

===Last years===
Dijkstra worked in Austin until his retirement in November 1999. To mark the occasion and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, which took place on his 70th birthday in May 2000.

Dijkstra and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in Nuenen, Netherlands, where he found that he had only months to live. He said that he wanted to retire in Austin, Texas, but to die in the Netherlands. Dijkstra died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer. He and his wife were survived by their three children: Marcus, Femke, and the computer scientist Rutger M. Dijkstra.

== Personality ==
=== Character ===
In the world of computing science, Dijkstra is well known as a &quot;character&quot;. In the preface of his book &quot;A Discipline of Programming&quot; (1976) he stated the following: &quot;For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.&quot; In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all. Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.

As a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavour. His approach to teaching was unconventional. His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra&#x27;s first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs. At the beginning of each semester, he would take a photo of each of his students in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students&#x27; solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra&#x27;s office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.

Dijkstra was also highly original in his way of assessing people&#x27;s capacity for a job. When Vladimir Lifschitz came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Lifschitz solved it and has been working in Austin since then.

=== Use of technology ===
He eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues&#x27; encouragement and acquired a Macintosh computer, he used it only for e-mail and for browsing the World Wide Web. Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his typewriter and later on his Montblanc pen. Dijkstra&#x27;s favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück fountain pen.

He had no use for word processors, believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting pen to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of Leiden.
Most of Dijkstra&#x27;s publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone. When colleagues prepared a Festschrift for his sixtieth birthday, published by Springer-Verlag, he took the trouble to thank each of the 61 contributors separately, in a hand-written letter.

In &quot;The Humble Programmer&quot; (1972), Dijkstra wrote: &quot;We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists&#x27;] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour.&quot;

Dijkstra also opposed the inclusion of software engineering under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, &quot;As economics is known as &quot;The Miserable Science&quot;, software engineering should be known as &quot;The Doomed Discipline&quot;, doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.&quot; And &quot;software engineering has accepted as its charter &#x27;How to program if you cannot.&#x27;&quot;

=== Personal life ===
Dijkstra led a modest lifestyle, to the point of being spartan. His and his wife&#x27;s house in Nuenen was simple, small and unassuming. He did not own a television, a video player, or a mobile telephone, and did not go to the movies. He played the piano, and, while in Austin, liked to go to concerts. An enthusiastic listener of classical music, Dijkstra&#x27;s favorite composer was Mozart.

== Essays and other writing ==
Throughout Dijkstra&#x27;s career, his work was characterized by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to a small group of colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists.

=== EWDs ===
Dijkstra was well known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his fountain pen. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with &quot;EWD&quot;, his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to Eindhoven, Dijkstra experienced a writer&#x27;s block for more than a year. He distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.

=== Writing style ===
His interest with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother&#x27;s guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that further, if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.

Dijkstra was famous for his wit, eloquence, rudeness, abruptness and often cruelty to fellow professionals, and way with words, such as in his remark, &quot;The question of whether Machines Can Think (…) is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.&quot; His advice to a promising researcher, who asked how to select a topic for research, was the phrase: &quot;Do only what only you can do&quot;. Dijkstra was also known for his vocal criticism and absence of social skills when interacting with colleagues. As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly opposed the teaching of BASIC.

=== Recurring themes ===
In many of his more witty essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having commercialized the production of mathematical theorems in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs. He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis but then had great difficulties collecting royalties from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a trade secret. Many of the company&#x27;s proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company&#x27;s effort had to be spent on maintenance. A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for Pythagoras&#x27; Theorem, that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs. Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as &quot;the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived&quot;. EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75% of the world&#x27;s market share.

== Legacy ==
Dijkstra won the Turing award in 1972 for his advocacy of structured programming, a programming paradigm that makes use of structured control flow as opposed to unstructured jumps to different sections in a program using Goto statements. His 1968 letter to the editor of &quot;Communications of ACM, &quot;Go To statement considered harmful&quot;&quot;, caused a major debate. Modern programmers generally adhere to the paradigm of structured programming.

Among his most famous contributions to computer science is &quot;shortest path algorithm&quot;, known as &quot;Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm,&quot; widely taught in modern computer science undergraduate courses. His other contributions included the &quot;Shunting yard algorithm&quot;; the THE multiprogramming system, an important early example of structuring a system as a set of layers; the &quot;Banker&#x27;s algorithm&quot;; and the semaphore construct for coordinating multiple processors and programs. Another concept formulated by Dijkstra in the field of distributed computing is that of self-stabilization – an alternative way to ensure the reliability of the system. Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is used in SPF, Shortest Path First, which is used in the routing protocols OSPF and IS-IS.

==Awards and honors==
Among Dijkstra&#x27;s awards and honors are:
* Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1971)
* Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (1971)
* The Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s A.M. Turing Award (1972)
* Harry H. Goode Memorial Award from the IEEE Computer Society (1974).
* Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1975)

* Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (1994)
* Honorary doctorate from the Athens University of Economics &amp; Business, Greece (2001).

In 1969, the British Computer Society (BCS) received approval for an award and fellowship, Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS), to be awarded under bylaw 7 of their royal charter. In 1971, the first election was made, to Dijkstra.

In 1990, on occasion of Dijkstra&#x27;s 60th birthday, the Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin organized a two-day seminar in his honor. Speakers came from all over the United States and Europe, and a group of computer scientists contributed research articles which were edited into a book.

In 2002, the C&amp;C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra &quot;for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.&quot; Dijkstra was alive to receive notice of the award, but it was accepted by his family in an award ceremony after his death.

Shortly before his death in 2002, Dijkstra received the ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize (Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing) the following year, in his honor.

The Dijkstra Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement in Computer Science (Loyola University Chicago, Department of Computer Science) is named for Edsger W. Dijkstra. Beginning in 2005, this award recognizes the top academic performance by a graduating computer science major. Selection is based on GPA in all major courses and election by department faculty.

The Department of Computer Science (UTCS) at the University of Texas at Austin hosted the inaugural Edsger W. Dijkstra Memorial Lecture on 12 October 2010. Tony Hoare, Emeritus Professor at Oxford and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, was the speaker for the event. This lecture series was made possible by a generous grant from Schlumberger to honor the memory of Dijkstra.

<doc id="10021" wikidata="Q847040" url="?curid=10021" title="Educational perennialism">
<text>Educational perennialism is a normative educational philosophy. Perennialists believe that the priority of education should be to teach principles that have persisted for centuries, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, rather than machines or techniques, and about liberal, rather than vocational, topics.

Perennialism appears similar to essentialism but focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula tend to be more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be teacher-centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as progressivism. Teachers associated with perennialism are authors of the Western masterpieces and are open to student criticism through the associated Socratic method.

==Secular perennialism==
The word &quot;perennial&quot; in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinite amount of time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler promoted a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings and encompassing humanist and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the University of Chicago, where they still strongly influence the Undergraduate Common Core. Other notable figures in the movement include Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan (who together initiated the Great Books program at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland), Mark Van Doren, Alexander Meiklejohn, and Sir Richard Livingstone, an English classicist with an American following. Inspired by Adler&#x27;s lectures, Sister Miriam Joseph wrote a textbook on the scholastic trivium and taught it as the Freshman seminar at Saint Mary&#x27;s College.

Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually advancing common orienting base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical paradigm shifts or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated. They firmly believe that exposure of all people to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the occidental oriented tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights, and responsibilities inherent to a true democracy.

Adler states: 
... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater.
Hutchins writes in the same vein: 
The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to &quot;our&quot; group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ...
As with the essentialists, perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but they stress that the overall aim should be exposure to history&#x27;s finest thinkers as models for discovery. The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts. Adler states: &quot;The three R&#x27;s, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education.&quot;

Secular perennialists agree with progressivists that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful great books of the Western canon. These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the world&#x27;s finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the &quot;Great Conversation&quot; of humanity with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works (abridged translations being acceptable as well) is that these are the products of &quot;genius&quot;. Hutchins remarks:

Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.

The Great Conversation is not static but, along with the set of related great books, changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses. In this way, it seeks to represent an evolution of thought not based upon the latest cultural fads. Hutchins clarifies this:
In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the name of love
Perennialism was proposed in response to what many considered a failing educational system. Again Hutchins writes:
The products of American high schools are illiterate; and a degree from a famous college or university is no guarantee that the graduate is in any better case. One of the most remarkable features of American society is that the difference between the &quot;uneducated&quot; and the &quot;educated&quot; is so slight.
In this regard John Dewey and Hutchins were in agreement. Hutchins&#x27;s book &quot;The Higher Learning in America&quot; deplored the &quot;plight of higher learning&quot; that had turned away from cultivation of the intellect and toward anti-intellectual practicality due, in part, to a lust for money. In a highly negative review of the book, Dewey wrote a series of articles in &quot;The Social Frontier&quot; which began by applauding Hutchins&#x27; attack on &quot;the aimlessness of our present educational scheme.

Perennialists believe in reading being supplemented by mutual investigations involving both teacher and student and minimally-directed discussions through the Socratic method in order to develop a historically oriented understanding of concepts. They argue that accurate, independent reasoning distinguishes the developed or educated mind and stress the development of this faculty. A skilled teacher keeps discussions on topic, corrects errors in reasoning, and accurately formulates problems within the scope of texts being studied but lets the class reach their own conclusions.

Perennialists argue that many of the historical debates and the development of ideas presented by the great books are relevant to any society at any time, making them suitable for instructional use regardless of their age. They acknowledge disagreement between various great books but believe that the student must learn to recognize these disagreements, think about them, and reach a reasoned, defensible conclusion. This is a major goal of the Socratic discussions.

==Religious perennialism==
Perennialism was originally religious in nature, developed first by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century in his work &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Teacher&quot;).

In the nineteenth century, John Henry Newman presented a defense of religious perennialism in &quot;The Idea of a University&quot;. Discourse 5 of that work, &quot;Knowledge Its Own End&quot;, is a recent statement of a Christian educational perennialism.

There are several epistemological options, which affect the pedagogical options. The possibilities may be surveyed by considering four extreme positions - idealistic rationalism, idealistic fideism, realistic rationalism and realistic fideism.

Teaching pupils to think critically and rationally are the main objectives of perennialist educators. A perennialist classroom seeks to be a highly structured and disciplined setting that fosters in pupils a never-ending search for the truth.

==Colleges exemplifying this philosophy==
* Reed College in Portland, Oregon is a well-known secular liberal arts college which requires a year-long humanities course covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Students may pursue an optional extension to this core curriculum in later years.
* St. John&#x27;s College (Annapolis/Santa Fe) in Annapolis, Maryland and Santa Fe, New Mexico is a secular liberal arts college with an undergraduate program described as &quot;an all-required course of study based on the great books of the Western tradition&quot;.

<text>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (tablet form), and molly (crystal form), is an empathogen–entactogenic drug with stimulant and minor psychedelic properties. In studies, it has been used alongside psychotherapy in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety in autism spectrum disorder. The purported pharmacological effects that may be prosocial include altered sensations, increased energy, empathy, and pleasure. When taken by mouth, effects begin in 30 to 45 minutes and last three to six hours.
MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by Merck chemist Anton Köllisch. It was used to enhance psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. Tablets sold as ecstasy may be mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2016, about 21 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.3% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine or amphetamines, but lower than for cannabis or opioids. In the United States, as of 2017, about 7% of people have used MDMA at some point in their lives and 0.9% have used it in the last year. The lethal risk from one dose of MDMA is estimated to be from 1 death in 20,000 instances to 1 death in 50,000 instances.
Short-term adverse effects include grinding of the teeth, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat, and extended use can also lead to addiction, memory problems, paranoia, and difficulty sleeping. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. Following use, people often feel depressed and tired, although this effect does not appear in clinical use, suggesting that it is not a direct result of MDMA administration. MDMA acts primarily by increasing the release of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It belongs to the substituted amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA is structurally similar to mescaline (a psychedelic), methamphetamine (a stimulant), as well as endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
MDMA has limited approved medical uses in a small number of countries, but is illegal in most jurisdictions. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is evaluating the drug for clinical use . Canada has allowed limited distribution of MDMA upon application to and approval by Health Canada. In Australia, it may be prescribed in the treatment of PTSD by specifically authorised psychiatrists.

==Effects==
In general, MDMA users report feeling the onset of subjective effects within 30 to 60 minutes of oral consumption and reaching peak effect at 75 to 120 minutes, which then plateaus for about 3.5 hours. The desired short-term psychoactive effects of MDMA have been reported to include:
* Euphoria – a sense of general well-being and happiness
* Increased self-confidence, sociability, and perception of facilitated communication
* Entactogenic effects—increased empathy or feelings of closeness with others and oneself
* Dilated pupils
* Relaxation and reduced anxiety
* Increased emotionality
* A sense of inner peace
* Mild hallucination
* Enhanced sensation, perception, or sexuality
* Altered sense of time

The experience elicited by MDMA depends on the dose, setting, and user. The variability of the induced altered state is lower compared to other psychedelics. For example, MDMA used at parties is associated with high motor activity, reduced sense of identity, and poor awareness of surroundings. Use of MDMA individually or in small groups in a quiet environment and when concentrating, is associated with increased lucidity, concentration, sensitivity to aesthetic aspects of the environment, enhanced awareness of emotions, and improved capability of communication. In psychotherapeutic settings, MDMA effects have been characterized by infantile ideas, mood lability, and memories and moods connected with childhood experiences.

MDMA has been described as an &quot;empathogenic&quot; drug because of its empathy-producing effects. Results of several studies show the effects of increased empathy with others. When testing MDMA for medium and high doses, it showed increased hedonic and arousal continuum. The effect of MDMA increasing sociability is consistent, while its effects on empathy have been more mixed.

==Uses==

===Recreational===

MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals, and house parties. In the rave environment, the sensory effects of music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple appealing aspects to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug&#x27;s stimulatory effects. MDMA is used less often than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.

MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, 2C-B, and ketamine. The combination with LSD is called &quot;candy-flipping&quot;. The combination with 2C-B is called &quot;nexus flipping&quot;. For this combination, most people take the MDMA first, wait until the peak is over, and then take the 2C-B.

MDMA is often co-administered with alcohol, methamphetamine, and prescription drugs such as SSRIs with which MDMA has several drug-drug interactions. Three life-threatening reports of MDMA co-administration with ritonavir have been reported; with ritonavir having severe and dangerous drug-drug interactions with a wide range of both psychoactive, anti-psychotic, and non-psychoactive drugs. 

===Medical===
As of 2023, MDMA therapies have only been approved for research purposes, with no widely accepted medical indications, although this varies by jurisdiction. Before it was widely banned, it saw limited use in psychotherapy. In 2017 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with some preliminary evidence that MDMA may facilitate psychotherapy efficacy for PTSD. Pilot studies indicate that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial in treating social anxiety in autistic adults. In these pilot studies, the vast majority of participants reported increased feelings of empathy that persisted after the therapy sessions. Some have proposed that psychedelics in general may act as active &quot;super placebos&quot; used for therapeutic purposes.

===Other===
Small doses of MDMA are used by some religious practitioners as an entheogen to enhance prayer or meditation. MDMA has been used as an adjunct to New Age spiritual practices.

===Forms===
MDMA has become widely known as ecstasy (shortened &quot;E&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;XTC&quot;), usually referring to its tablet form, although this term may also include the presence of possible adulterants or diluents. The UK term &quot;mandy&quot; and the US term &quot;molly&quot; colloquially refer to MDMA in a crystalline powder form that is thought to be free of adulterants. MDMA is also sold in the form of the hydrochloride salt, either as loose crystals or in gelcaps. MDMA tablets can sometimes be found in a shaped form that may depict characters from popular culture. These are sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;fun tablets&quot;.

Partly due to the global supply shortage of sassafras oil—a problem largely assuaged by use of improved or alternative modern methods of synthesis—the purity of substances sold as molly have been found to vary widely. Some of these substances contain methylone, ethylone, MDPV, mephedrone, or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as bath salts, in addition to, or in place of, MDMA. Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity. MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (notably lactose) and binding agents. Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers. Some tablets contain little or no MDMA. The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country. The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.

MDMA is usually consumed by mouth. It is also sometimes snorted.

==Adverse effects==

===Short-term===
Acute adverse effects are usually the result of high or multiple doses, although single dose toxicity can occur in susceptible individuals. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are hyperthermia and dehydration. Cases of life-threatening or fatal hyponatremia (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attempting to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amounts of water without replenishing electrolytes.

The immediate adverse effects of MDMA use can include:

* Bruxism (grinding and clenching of the teeth)
* Dehydration
* Diarrhea
* Erectile dysfunction
* Hyperthermia
* Increased wakefulness or insomnia
* Increased perspiration and sweating
* Increased heart rate and blood pressure
* Increased psychomotor activity
* Loss of appetite
* Nausea and vomiting
* Visual and auditory hallucinations (rarely)
Other adverse effects that may occur or persist for up to a week following cessation of moderate MDMA use include:

;Physiological

* Insomnia
* Loss of appetite
* Tiredness or lethargy
* Trismus (lockjaw)

;Psychological

* Anhedonia
* Anxiety or paranoia
* Depression
* Impulsiveness
* Irritability
* Memory impairment
* Restlessness
Administration of MDMA to mice causes DNA damage in their brain, especially when the mice are sleep deprived. Even at the very low doses that are comparable to those self-administered by humans, MDMA causes oxidative stress and both single and double-strand breaks in the DNA of the hippocampus region of the mouse brain.

===Long-term===

, the long-term effects of MDMA on human brain structure and function have not been fully determined. However, there is consistent evidence of structural and functional deficits in MDMA users with high lifetime exposure. These structural or functional changes appear to be dose dependent and may be less prominent in MDMA users with only a moderate (typically &lt;50 doses used and &lt;100 tablets consumed) lifetime exposure. Nonetheless, moderate MDMA use may still be neurotoxic and what constitutes moderate use is not clearly established.

Furthermore, it is not clear yet whether &quot;typical&quot; recreational users of MDMA (1 to 2 pills of 75 to 125mg MDMA or analogue every 1 to 4 weeks) will develop neurotoxic brain lesions. Long-term exposure to MDMA in humans has been shown to produce marked neurodegeneration in striatal, hippocampal, prefrontal, and occipital serotonergic axon terminals. Neurotoxic damage to serotonergic axon terminals has been shown to persist for more than two years. Elevations in brain temperature from MDMA use are positively correlated with MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. However, most studies on MDMA and serotonergic neurotoxicity in humans focus more on heavy users who consume as much as seven times or more the amount that most users report taking. The evidence for the presence of serotonergic neurotoxicity in casual users who take lower doses less frequently is not conclusive.

However, adverse neuroplastic changes to brain microvasculature and white matter have been observed to occur in humans using low doses of MDMA. Reduced gray matter density in certain brain structures has also been noted in human MDMA users. Global reductions in gray matter volume, thinning of the parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, and decreased hippocampal activity have been observed in long term users. The effects established so far for recreational use of ecstasy lie in the range of moderate to severe effects for serotonin transporter reduction.

Impairments in multiple aspects of cognition, including attention, learning, memory, visual processing, and sleep, have been found in regular MDMA users. The magnitude of these impairments is correlated with lifetime MDMA usage and are partially reversible with abstinence. Several forms of memory are impaired by chronic ecstasy use; however, the effects for memory impairments in ecstasy users are generally small overall. MDMA use is also associated with increased impulsivity and depression.

Serotonin depletion following MDMA use can cause depression in subsequent days. In some cases, depressive symptoms persist for longer periods. Some studies indicate repeated recreational use of ecstasy is associated with depression and anxiety, even after quitting the drug. Depression is one of the main reasons for cessation of use.

At high doses, MDMA induces a neuroimmune response that, through several mechanisms, increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, thereby making the brain more susceptible to environmental toxins and pathogens. In addition, MDMA has immunosuppressive effects in the peripheral nervous system and pro-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system.

MDMA may increase the risk of cardiac valvulopathy in heavy or long-term users due to activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors. MDMA induces cardiac epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, particularly hypermethylation changes.

===Reinforcement disorders===

Approximately 60% of MDMA users experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking MDMA. Some of these symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, and trouble concentrating. Tolerance to some of the desired and adverse effects of MDMA is expected to occur with consistent MDMA use. A 2007 delphic analysis of a panel of experts in pharmacology, psychiatry, law, policing and others estimated MDMA to have a psychological dependence and physical dependence potential roughly three-fourths to four-fifths that of cannabis.
MDMA has been shown to induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens. Because MDMA releases dopamine in the striatum, the mechanisms by which it induces ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens are analogous to other dopaminergic psychostimulants. Therefore, chronic use of MDMA at high doses can result in altered brain structure and drug addiction that occur as a consequence of ΔFosB overexpression in the nucleus accumbens. MDMA is less addictive than other stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Compared with amphetamine, MDMA and its metabolite MDA are less reinforcing.
One study found approximately 15% of chronic MDMA users met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance dependence. However, there is little evidence for a specific diagnosable MDMA dependence syndrome because MDMA is typically used relatively infrequently.
There are currently no medications to treat MDMA addiction.

===During pregnancy===
MDMA is a moderately teratogenic drug (i.e., it is toxic to the fetus). In utero exposure to MDMA is associated with a neuro- and cardiotoxicity and impaired motor functioning. Motor delays may be temporary during infancy or long-term. The severity of these developmental delays increases with heavier MDMA use. MDMA has been shown to promote the survival of fetal dopaminergic neurons in culture.

==Overdose==
MDMA overdose symptoms vary widely due to the involvement of multiple organ systems. Some of the more overt overdose symptoms are listed in the table below. The number of instances of fatal MDMA intoxication is low relative to its usage rates. In most fatalities, MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by serotonin syndrome and sympathomimetic effects. Sympathomimetic side effects can be managed with carvedilol. MDMA&#x27;s toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut in order to increase volume. A scheme for management of acute MDMA toxicity has been published focusing on treatment of hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, serotonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure.

== Interactions ==
A number of drug interactions can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Life-threatening reactions and death have occurred in people who took MDMA while on ritonavir. Bupropion, a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to increase MDMA exposure with administration of MDMA. Concurrent use of MDMA high dosages with another serotonergic drug can result in a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix). Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), duloxetine (Cymbalta), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil) have been shown to block most of the subjective effects of MDMA. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) such as reboxetine (Edronax) have been found to reduce emotional excitation and feelings of stimulation with MDMA but do not appear to influence its entactogenic or mood-elevating effects.

MDMA induces the release of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby acts as an indirectly acting sympathomimetic and produces a variety of cardiostimulant effects. It dose-dependently increases heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. SRIs like citalopram and paroxetine, as well as the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin, have been found to partially block the increases in heart rate and blood pressure with MDMA. It is notable in this regard that serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin, which act as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, likewise have sympathomimetic effects. The NRI reboxetine and the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine block MDMA-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Conversely, bupropion, a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) with only weak dopaminergic activity, reduced MDMA-induced heart rate and circulating norepinephrine increases but did not affect MDMA-induced blood pressure increases. On the other hand, the robust NDRI methylphenidate, which has sympathomimetic effects of its own, has been found to augment the cardiovascular effects and increases in circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine levels induced by MDMA.

The non-selective beta blocker pindolol blocked MDMA-induced increases in heart rate but not blood pressure. The α2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine did not affect the cardiovascular effects of MDMA, though it reduced blood pressure. The α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists doxazosin and prazosin blocked or reduced MDMA-induced blood pressure increases but augmented MDMA-induced heart rate and cardiac output increases. The dual α1- and β-adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol reduced MDMA-induced heart rate and blood pressure increases. In contrast to the cases of serotonergic and noradrenergic agents, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol did not affect the cardiovascular responses to MDMA. Due to the theoretical risk of &quot;unopposed α-stimulation&quot; and possible consequences like coronary vasospasm, it has been suggested that dual α1- and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists like carvedilol and labetalol, rather than selective beta blockers, should be used in the management of stimulant-induced sympathomimetic toxicity, for instance in the context of overdose.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===


MDMA is an entactogen or empathogen, as well as a stimulant, euphoriant, and weak psychedelic. It is a substrate of the monoamine transporters (MATs) and acts as a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). The drug is specifically a well-balanced serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). To a lesser extent, MDMA also acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). MDMA enters monoaminergic neurons via the MATs and then, via poorly understood mechanisms, reverses the direction of these transporters to produce efflux of the monoamine neurotransmitters rather than the usual reuptake. Induction of monoamine efflux by amphetamines in general may involve intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ elevation and PKC and CaMKIIα activation. MDMA also acts on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) on synaptic vesicles to increase the cytosolic concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters available for efflux. By inducing release and reuptake inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, MDMA increases levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain and periphery.

In addition to its actions as an SNDRA, MDMA directly but more modestly interacts with a number of monoamine and other receptors. It is a low-potency partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. The drug also interacts with α2-adrenergic receptors, with the sigma σ1 and σ2 receptors, and with the imidazoline I1 receptor. It is thought that agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by MDMA may mediate the weak psychedelic effects of the drug in humans. However, findings in this area appear to be conflicting. Likewise, findings on MDMA and induction of the head-twitch response (HTR), a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, are contradictory in animals. Along with the preceding receptor interactions, MDMA is a potent partial agonist of the rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Conversely however, it is far weaker in terms of potency as an agonist of the human TAAR1. Moreover, MDMA acts as a weak partial agonist or antagonist of the human TAAR1 rather than as an efficacious agonist. In relation to the preceding, MDMA has been said to be inactive as a human TAAR1 agonist. TAAR1 activation is thought to auto-inhibit and constrain the effects of amphetamines that possess TAAR1 agonism, for instance MDMA in rodents.

Elevation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels by MDMA is believed to mediate most of the drug&#x27;s effects, including its entactogenic, stimulant, euphoriant, hyperthermic, and sympathomimetic effects. The entactogenic effects of MDMA, including increased sociability, empathy, feelings of closeness, and reduced aggression, are thought to be mainly due to induction of serotonin release. The exact serotonin receptors responsible for these effects are unclear, but may include the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, 5-HT1B receptor, and 5-HT2A receptor, as well as 5-HT1A receptor-mediated oxytocin release and consequent activation of the oxytocin receptor. Induction of dopamine release is thought to be importantly involved in the stimulant and euphoriant effects of MDMA, while induction of norepinephrine release and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor stimulation are believed to mediate its sympathomimetic effects. MDMA has been associated with a unique subjective &quot;magic&quot; or euphoria that few or no other known entactogens are said to fully reproduce. The mechanisms underlying this property of MDMA are unknown, but it has been theorized to be due to a very specific mixture and balance of pharmacological activities, including combined serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine release and direct serotonin receptor agonism. Repeated activation of serotonin 5-HT2B receptors by MDMA is thought to result in risk of valvular heart disease (VHD) and primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). MDMA has been associated with serotonergic neurotoxicity. This may be due to formation of toxic MDMA metabolites and/or induction of simultaneous serotonin and dopamine release, with consequent uptake of dopamine into serotonergic neurons and breakdown into toxic species.

MDMA is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA and (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA. (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA is much more potent as an SNDRA &quot;in vitro&quot; and in producing MDMA-like subjective effects in humans than (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA. By contrast, (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA acts as a lower-potency serotonin–norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) with weak or negligible effects on dopamine. Relatedly, (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA shows weak or negligible stimulant-like and rewarding effects in animals. Both (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA and (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA produce entactogen-type effects in animals and humans. In addition, both (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA and (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA are weak agonists of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA is more potent and efficacious as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor agonist than (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA, whereas (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA is somewhat more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Despite its greater serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism however, (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA did not produce more psychedelic-like effects than (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA in humans.

MDMA produces 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) as a minor active metabolite. Peak levels of MDA are about 5 to 10% of those of MDMA and total exposure to MDA is almost 10% of that of MDMA with oral MDMA administration. As a result, MDA may contribute to some extent to the effects of MDMA. MDA is an entactogen, stimulant, and weak psychedelic similarly to MDMA. Like MDMA, it acts as a potent and well-balanced SNDRA and as a weak serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist. However, MDA shows much more potent and efficacious serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor agonism than MDMA. Accordingly, MDA produces greater psychedelic effects than MDMA in humans and might particularly contribute to the mild psychedelic-like effects of MDMA. On the other hand, MDA may also be importantly involved in toxicity of MDMA, such as cardiac valvulopathy.

The duration of action of MDMA (3–6hours) is much shorter than its elimination half-life (8–9hours) would imply. In relation to this, MDMA&#x27;s duration and the offset of its effects appear to be determined more by rapid acute tolerance rather than by circulating drug concentrations. Similar findings have been made for amphetamine and methamphetamine. One mechanism by which tolerance to MDMA may occur is internalization of the serotonin transporter (SERT). Although MDMA and serotonin are not significant TAAR1 agonists in humans, TAAR1 activation by MDMA may result in SERT internalization.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The MDMA concentration in the blood stream starts to rise after about 30 minutes, and reaches its maximal concentration in the blood stream between 1.5 and 3 hours after ingestion. It is then slowly metabolized and excreted, with levels of MDMA and its metabolites decreasing to half their peak concentration over the next several hours. The duration of action of MDMA is about 3 to 6hours. Brain serotonin levels are depleted after MDMA administration but serotonin levels typically return to normal within 24 to 48hours.

Metabolites of MDMA that have been identified in humans include 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA), 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (DHA) (also called alpha-methyldopamine (α-Me-DA)), 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (MDP2P), and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-hydroxyamphetamine (MDOH). The contributions of these metabolites to the psychoactive and toxic effects of MDMA are an area of active research. 80% of MDMA is metabolised in the liver, and about 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine.

MDMA is known to be metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: (1) &quot;O&quot;-demethylenation followed by catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) &quot;N&quot;-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The metabolism may be primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and COMT. Complex, nonlinear pharmacokinetics arise via autoinhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP2D8, resulting in zeroth order kinetics at higher doses. It is thought that this can result in sustained and higher concentrations of MDMA if the user takes consecutive doses of the drug.

MDMA and metabolites are primarily excreted as conjugates, such as sulfates and glucuronides. MDMA is a chiral compound and has been almost exclusively administered as a racemate. However, the two enantiomers have been shown to exhibit different kinetics. The disposition of MDMA may also be stereoselective, with the S-enantiomer having a shorter elimination half-life and greater excretion than the R-enantiomer. Evidence suggests that the area under the blood plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was two to four times higher for the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer than the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer after a 40mg oral dose in human volunteers. Likewise, the plasma half-life of (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA was significantly longer than that of the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer (5.8±2.2 hours vs 3.6±0.9 hours). However, because MDMA excretion and metabolism have nonlinear kinetics, the half-lives would be higher at more typical doses (100mg is sometimes considered a typical dose).

==Chemistry==
MDMA is in the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of chemicals. As a free base, MDMA is a colorless oil insoluble in water. The most common salt of MDMA is the hydrochloride salt; pure MDMA hydrochloride is water-soluble and appears as a white or off-white powder or crystal.

===Synthesis===
There are numerous methods available to synthesize MDMA via different intermediates. The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck&#x27;s patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P in turn is generally synthesized from piperonal, safrole or isosafrole. One method is to isomerize safrole to isosafrole in the presence of a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (&quot;R&quot;)-MDMA and (&quot;S&quot;)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of &quot;Ocotea cymbarum&quot;, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole. This allows 500mL of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.


===Detection in body fluids===
MDMA and MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDMA or its major metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.

==History==

===Early research and use===
MDMA was first synthesized and patented in 1912 by Merck chemist Anton Köllisch. At the time, Merck was interested in developing substances that stopped abnormal bleeding. Merck wanted to avoid an existing patent held by Bayer for one such compound: hydrastinine. Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine analogue, methylhydrastinine, at the request of fellow lab members, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes. MDMA (called methylsafrylamin, safrylmethylamin or N-Methyl-a-Methylhomopiperonylamin in Merck laboratory reports) was an intermediate compound in the synthesis of methylhydrastinine. Merck was not interested in MDMA itself at the time. On 24 December 1912, Merck filed two patent applications that described the synthesis and some chemical properties of MDMA and its subsequent conversion to methylhydrastinine. Merck records indicate its researchers returned to the compound sporadically. A 1920 Merck patent describes a chemical modification to MDMA.

MDMA&#x27;s analogue 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) was first synthesized in 1910 as a derivative of adrenaline. Gordon A. Alles, the discoverer of the psychoactive effects of amphetamine, also discovered the psychoactive effects of MDA in 1930 in a self-experiment in which he administered a high dose (126mg) to himself. MDA was later tested as an appetite suppressant by Smith, Kline &amp; French and for other uses by other groups in the 1950s. In relation to this, the psychoactive effects of MDA were discovered well before those of MDMA.

In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to adrenaline or ephedrine, the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on vascular smooth muscle tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no &quot;local effect at the eye&quot;. MDMA was also found to have effects on blood sugar levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the sympathetic nervous system. Research was stopped &quot;particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine&quot;, which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.

Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA. In 1953 and 1954, the United States Army commissioned a study of toxicity and behavioral effects in animals injected with mescaline and several analogues, including MDMA. Conducted at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, these investigations were declassified in October 1969 and published in 1973. A 1960 Polish paper by Biniecki and Krajewski describing the synthesis of MDMA as an intermediate was the first published scientific paper on the substance.

MDA appeared as a recreational drug in the mid-1960s. MDMA may have been in non-medical use in the western United States in 1968. An August 1970 report at a meeting of crime laboratory chemists indicates MDMA was being used recreationally in the Chicago area by 1970. MDMA likely emerged as a substitute for MDA, a drug at the time popular among users of psychedelics which was made a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the United States in 1970.

=== Shulgin&#x27;s research ===
American chemist and psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin reported he synthesized MDMA in 1965 while researching methylenedioxy compounds at Dow Chemical Company, but did not test the psychoactivity of the compound at this time. Around 1970, Shulgin sent instructions for N-methylated MDA (MDMA) synthesis to the founder of a Los Angeles chemical company who had requested them. This individual later provided these instructions to a client in the Midwest. Shulgin may have suspected he played a role in the emergence of MDMA in Chicago.

Shulgin first heard of the psychoactive effects of N-methylated MDA around 1975 from a young student who reported &quot;amphetamine-like content&quot;. Around 30 May 1976, Shulgin again heard about the effects of N-methylated MDA, this time from a graduate student in a medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University who directed him to the University of Michigan study. She and two close friends had consumed 100mg of MDMA and reported positive emotional experiences. Following the self-trials of a colleague at the University of San Francisco, Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in September and October 1976. Shulgin first reported on MDMA in a presentation at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland in December 1976. In 1978, he and David E. Nichols published a report on the drug&#x27;s psychoactive effect in humans. They described MDMA as inducing &quot;an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones&quot; comparable &quot;to marijuana, to psilocybin devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA&quot;.

While not finding his own experiences with MDMA particularly powerful, Shulgin was impressed with the drug&#x27;s disinhibiting effects and thought it could be useful in therapy. Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug &quot;window&quot;. Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as &quot;my low-calorie martini&quot;, and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it. One such person was Leo Zeff, a psychotherapist who had been known to use psychedelic substances in his practice. When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff was impressed with the effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the United States and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA. Zeff named the drug &quot;Adam&quot;, believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.

Psychotherapists who used MDMA believed the drug eliminated the typical fear response and increased communication. Sessions were usually held in the home of the patient or the therapist. The role of the therapist was minimized in favor of patient self-discovery accompanied by MDMA induced feelings of empathy. Depression, substance use disorders, relationship problems, premenstrual syndrome, and autism were among several psychiatric disorders MDMA assisted therapy was reported to treat. According to psychiatrist George Greer, therapists who used MDMA in their practice were impressed by the results. Anecdotally, MDMA was said to greatly accelerate therapy. According to David Nutt, MDMA was widely used in the western US in couples counseling, and was called &quot;empathy&quot;. Only later was the term &quot;ecstasy&quot; used for it, coinciding with rising opposition to its use.

===Rising recreational use===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;Adam&quot; spread through personal networks of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, users of psychedelics, and yuppies. Hoping MDMA could avoid criminalization like LSD and mescaline, psychotherapists and experimenters attempted to limit the spread of MDMA and information about it while conducting informal research. Early MDMA distributors were deterred from large scale operations by the threat of possible legislation. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, this network of MDMA users consumed an estimated 500,000 doses.

A small recreational market for MDMA developed by the late 1970s, consuming perhaps 10,000 doses in 1976. By the early 1980s MDMA was being used in Boston and New York City nightclubs such as Studio 54 and Paradise Garage. Into the early 1980s, as the recreational market slowly expanded, production of MDMA was dominated by a small group of therapeutically minded Boston chemists. Having commenced production in 1976, this &quot;Boston Group&quot; did not keep up with growing demand and shortages frequently occurred.

Perceiving a business opportunity, Michael Clegg, the Southwest distributor for the Boston Group, started his own &quot;Texas Group&quot; backed financially by Texas friends. In 1981, Clegg had coined &quot;Ecstasy&quot; as a slang term for MDMA to increase its marketability. Starting in 1983, the Texas Group mass-produced MDMA in a Texas lab or imported it from California and marketed tablets using pyramid sales structures and toll-free numbers. MDMA could be purchased via credit card and taxes were paid on sales. Under the brand name &quot;Sassyfras&quot;, MDMA tablets were sold in brown bottles. The Texas Group advertised &quot;Ecstasy parties&quot; at bars and discos, describing MDMA as a &quot;fun drug&quot; and &quot;good to dance to&quot;. MDMA was openly distributed in Austin and Dallas–Fort Worth area bars and nightclubs, becoming popular with yuppies, college students, and gays.

Recreational use also increased after several cocaine dealers switched to distributing MDMA following experiences with the drug. A California laboratory that analyzed confidentially submitted drug samples first detected MDMA in 1975. Over the following years the number of MDMA samples increased, eventually exceeding the number of MDA samples in the early 1980s. By the mid-1980s, MDMA use had spread to colleges around the United States.

===Media attention and scheduling===

====United States====
In an early media report on MDMA published in 1982, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman stated the agency would ban the drug if enough evidence for abuse could be found. By mid-1984, MDMA use was becoming more noticed. Bill Mandel reported on &quot;Adam&quot; in a 10 June San Francisco Chronicle article, but misidentified the drug as methyloxymethylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA). In the next month, the World Health Organization identified MDMA as the only substance out of twenty phenethylamines to be seized a significant number of times.

After a year of planning and data collection, MDMA was proposed for scheduling by the DEA on 27 July 1984, with a request for comments and objections. The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing. In a Newsweek article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists. An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C., with administrative law judge Francis L. Young presiding. It was decided there to hold three more hearings that year: Los Angeles on 10 June, Kansas City, Missouri on 10–11 July, and Washington, D.C., on 8–11 October.

Sensational media attention was given to the proposed criminalization and the reaction of MDMA proponents, effectively advertising the drug. In response to the proposed scheduling, the Texas Group increased production from 1985 estimates of 30,000 tablets a month to as many as 8,000 per day, potentially making two million ecstasy tablets in the months before MDMA was made illegal. By some estimates the Texas Group distributed 500,000 tablets per month in Dallas alone. According to one participant in an ethnographic study, the Texas Group produced more MDMA in eighteen months than all other distribution networks combined across their entire histories. By May 1985, MDMA use was widespread in California, Texas, southern Florida, and the northeastern United States. According to the DEA there was evidence of use in twenty-eight states and Canada. Urged by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the DEA announced an emergency Schedule I classification of MDMA on 31 May 1985. The agency cited increased distribution in Texas, escalating street use, and new evidence of MDA (an analog of MDMA) neurotoxicity as reasons for the emergency measure. The ban took effect one month later on 1 July 1985 in the midst of Nancy Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign.

As a result of several expert witnesses testifying that MDMA had an accepted medical usage, the administrative law judge presiding over the hearings recommended that MDMA be classified as a Schedule III substance. Despite this, DEA administrator John C. Lawn overruled and classified the drug as Schedule I. Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon then sued the DEA, claiming that the DEA had ignored the medical uses of MDMA, and the federal court sided with Grinspoon, calling Lawn&#x27;s argument &quot;strained&quot; and &quot;unpersuasive&quot;, and vacated MDMA&#x27;s Schedule I status. Despite this, less than a month later Lawn reviewed the evidence and reclassified MDMA as Schedule I again, claiming that the expert testimony of several psychiatrists claiming over 200 cases where MDMA had been used in a therapeutic context with positive results could be dismissed because they were not published in medical journals. In 2017, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for its use with psychotherapy for PTSD. However, this designation has been questioned and problematized.

====United Nations====
While engaged in scheduling debates in the United States, the DEA also pushed for international scheduling. In 1985, the World Health Organization&#x27;s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The committee made this recommendation on the basis of the pharmacological similarity of MDMA to previously scheduled drugs, reports of illicit trafficking in Canada, drug seizures in the United States, and lack of well-defined therapeutic use. While intrigued by reports of psychotherapeutic uses for the drug, the committee viewed the studies as lacking appropriate methodological design and encouraged further research. Committee chairman Paul Grof dissented, believing international control was not warranted at the time and a recommendation should await further therapeutic data. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs added MDMA to Schedule I of the convention on 11 February 1986.

===Post-scheduling===
The use of MDMA in Texas clubs declined rapidly after criminalization, but by 1991, the drug became popular among young middle-class whites and in nightclubs. In 1985, MDMA use became associated with acid house on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Thereafter, in the late 1980s, the drug spread alongside rave culture to the UK and then to other European and American cities. Illicit MDMA use became increasingly widespread among young adults in universities and later, in high schools. Since the mid-1990s, MDMA has become the most widely used amphetamine-type drug by college students and teenagers. MDMA became one of the four most widely used illicit drugs in the US, along with cocaine, heroin, and cannabis.
According to some estimates as of 2004, only marijuana attracts more first time users in the US.

After MDMA was criminalized, most medical use stopped, although some therapists continued to prescribe the drug illegally. Later, Charles Grob initiated an ascending-dose safety study in healthy volunteers. Subsequent FDA-approved MDMA studies in humans have taken place in the United States in Detroit (Wayne State University), Chicago (University of Chicago), San Francisco (UCSF and California Pacific Medical Center), Baltimore (NIDA–NIH Intramural Program), and South Carolina. Studies have also been conducted in Switzerland (University Hospital of Psychiatry, Zürich), the Netherlands (Maastricht University), and Spain (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona).

&quot;Molly&quot;, short for &#x27;molecule&#x27;, was recognized as a slang term for crystalline or powder MDMA in the 2000s.

In 2010, the BBC reported that use of MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years. This may be due to increased seizures during use and decreased production of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture MDMA. Unwitting substitution with other drugs, such as mephedrone and methamphetamine, as well as legal alternatives to MDMA, such as BZP, MDPV, and methylone, are also thought to have contributed to its decrease in popularity.

In 2017, it was found that some pills being sold as MDMA contained pentylone, which can cause very unpleasant agitation and paranoia.

According to David Nutt, when safrole was restricted by the United Nations in order to reduce the supply of MDMA, producers in China began using anethole instead, but this gives para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA, also known as &quot;Dr Death&quot;), which is much more toxic than MDMA and can cause overheating, muscle spasms, seizures, unconsciousness, and death. People wanting MDMA are sometimes sold PMA instead.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
MDMA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.

====Australia====
In Australia, MDMA was rescheduled on 1 July 2023 as a schedule 8 substance (available on prescription) when used in the treatment of PTSD, while remaining a schedule 9 substance (prohibited) for all other uses. For the treatment of PTSD, MDMA can only be prescribed by psychiatrists with specific training and authorisation.
In 1986, MDMA was declared an illegal substance because of its allegedly harmful effects and potential for misuse. Any non-authorised sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized ethics committee on human research.

In Western Australia under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 4.0g of MDMA is the amount required determining a court of trial, 2.0g is considered a presumption with intent to sell or supply and 28.0g is considered trafficking under Australian law.

The Australian Capital Territory passed legislation to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of MDMA, which took effect in October 2023.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, MDMA was made illegal in 1977 by a modification order to the existing Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Although MDMA was not named explicitly in this legislation, the order extended the definition of Class A drugs to include various ring-substituted phenethylamines. The drug is therefore illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a licence in the UK. Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.

Some researchers such as David Nutt have criticized the scheduling of MDMA, which he determined to be a relatively harmless drug. An editorial he wrote in the &quot;Journal of Psychopharmacology&quot;, where he compared the risk of harm for horse riding (1 adverse event in 350) to that of ecstasy (1 in 10,000) resulted in his dismissal as well as the resignation of his colleagues from the ACMD.

====United States====
In the United States, MDMA is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. In a 2011 federal court hearing, the American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that the sentencing guideline for MDMA/ecstasy is based on outdated science, leading to excessive prison sentences. Other courts have upheld the sentencing guidelines. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee explained its ruling by noting that &quot;an individual federal district court judge simply cannot marshal resources akin to those available to the Commission for tackling the manifold issues involved with determining a proper drug equivalency.&quot;

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the Expert Committee on the List (Expertcommissie Lijstensystematiek Opiumwet) issued a report in June 2011 which discussed the evidence for harm and the legal status of MDMA, arguing in favor of maintaining it on List I.

====Canada====
In Canada, MDMA is listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was updated as a result of the Safe Streets and Communities Act changing amphetamines from Schedule III to Schedule I in March 2012. In 2022, the federal government granted British Columbia a 3-year exemption, legalizing the possession of up to of MDMA in the province from February 2023 until February 2026.

===Demographics===

In 2014, 3.5% of 18 to 25 year-olds had used MDMA in the United States. In the European Union as of 2018, 4.1% of adults (15–64 years old) have used MDMA at least once in their life, and 0.8% had used it in the last year. Among young adults, 1.8% had used MDMA in the last year.

In Europe, an estimated 37% of regular club-goers aged 14 to 35 used MDMA in the past year according to the 2015 European Drug report. The highest one-year prevalence of MDMA use in Germany in 2012 was 1.7% among people aged 25 to 29 compared with a population average of 0.4%. Among adolescent users in the United States between 1999 and 2008, girls were more likely to use MDMA than boys.

===Economics===

====Europe====
In 2008 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction noted that although there were some reports of tablets being sold for as little as €1, most countries in Europe then reported typical retail prices in the range of €3 to €9 per tablet, typically containing 25–65mg of MDMA. By 2014 the EMCDDA reported that the range was more usually between €5 and €10 per tablet, typically containing 57–102mg of MDMA, although MDMA in powder form was becoming more common.

====North America====
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime stated in its 2014 World Drug Report that US ecstasy retail prices range from US$1 to $70 per pill, or from $15,000 to $32,000 per kilogram. A new research area named Drug Intelligence aims to automatically monitor distribution networks based on image processing and machine learning techniques, in which an Ecstasy pill picture is analyzed to detect correlations among different production batches. These novel techniques allow police scientists to facilitate the monitoring of illicit distribution networks.

, most of the MDMA in the United States is produced in British Columbia, Canada and imported by Canada-based Asian transnational criminal organizations. The market for MDMA in the United States is relatively small compared to methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010.

====Australia====
MDMA is particularly expensive in Australia, costing A$15–A$30 per tablet. In terms of purity data for Australian MDMA, the average is around 34%, ranging from less than 1% to about 85%. The majority of tablets contain 70–85mg of MDMA. Most MDMA enters Australia from the Netherlands, the UK, Asia, and the US.

====Corporate logos on pills====

A number of ecstasy manufacturers brand their pills with a logo, often being the logo of an unrelated corporation. Some pills depict logos of products or media popular with children, such as Shaun the Sheep.

==Research directions==
A 2014 review of the safety and efficacy of MDMA as a treatment for various disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), indicated that MDMA has therapeutic efficacy in some patients. Four clinical trials provide moderate evidence in support of this treatment. Some authors have concluded that because of MDMA&#x27;s potential to cause lasting harm in humans (e.g., serotonergic neurotoxicity and persistent memory impairment), &quot;considerably more research must be performed&quot; on its efficacy in PTSD treatment to determine if the potential treatment benefits outweigh its potential to harm a patient. Other authors have argued that the neurotoxic effects of MDMA are dose-dependent, with lower doses exhibiting lower neurotoxicity or even neuroprotection, and that MDMA assisted psychotherapy is considerably safer than current treatments.

Animal models suggest that postnatal exposure may ameliorate social impairments in autism.

Recent evidence suggests the safe and potentially effective use of MDMA to treat the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Unlike other treatments for mental illness, MDMA would be intended to be used infrequently and alongside psychotherapy in treatment.

<text>The flag of Europe or European flag consists of twelve golden stars forming a circle on a blue field. It is the official flag of the European Union. It was designed and adopted in 1955 by the Council of Europe (CoE) as a symbol for the whole of Europe.

Since 1985, the flag has also been a symbol of the European Union (EU), whose 27 member states are all also CoE members, although in that year the EU had not yet assumed its present name or constitutional form (which came in steps in 1993 and 2009). Adoption by the EU, or EC as it then was, reflected long-standing CoE desire to see the flag used by other European organisations. Official EU use widened greatly in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the flag has to date received &quot;no status&quot; in any of the EU&#x27;s treaties. Its adoption as an official symbol was planned as part of the 2004 &quot;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&quot; but this failed to be ratified. Mention of the flag was removed in 2007 from the text of the Treaty of Lisbon, which &quot;was&quot; ratified. On the other hand, 16 EU members that year, plus France in 2017, have officially affirmed (by Declaration No. 5224) their attachment to the flag as an EU symbol.

The flag is used by other European entities, such as unified golf teams under the rubric Team Europe.

==Blazon==
The blazon given by the EU in 1996 describe the design as: &quot;On an azure field a circle of twelve golden mullets, their points not touching.&quot;

==Symbolism==
The flag used is the Flag of Europe, which consists of a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present European Union, in 1986. The Council of Europe gave the flag a symbolic description in the following terms, though the official symbolic description adopted by the EU omits the reference to the &quot;Western world&quot;:

Other symbolic interpretations have been offered based on the account of its design by Paul M. Levy. The five-pointed star is used on many national flags and represents aspiration and education. Their golden colour is that of the sun, which is said to symbolise glory and enlightenment.

Their arrangement in a circle represents the constellation of Corona Borealis and can be seen as a crown and the stability of government. The blue background resembles the sky and symbolises truth and the intellect. It is also the colour traditionally used to represent the Virgin Mary. In many paintings of the Virgin Mary as Stella Maris she is crowned with a circle of twelve stars.

===Marian interpretation===


In 1987, following the adoption of the flag by the EC, Arsène Heitz (1908–1989), one of the designers who had submitted proposals for the flag&#x27;s design, suggested a religious inspiration for it. He stated that the circle of stars was based on the iconographic tradition of showing the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse, wearing a &quot;crown of twelve stars&quot;.

Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag&#x27;s adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Paul M. G. Lévy, then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.

In an interview given 26 February 1998, Lévy denied not only awareness of the Marian connection, but also denied that the final design of a circle of twelve stars was Heitz&#x27;s. To the question &quot;Who really designed the flag?&quot; Lévy replied:

I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Arsène Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.

Carlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reconstructed the design process to the effect that Heitz&#x27;s proposal contained varying numbers of stars, from which the version with twelve stars was chosen by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two remaining candidate designs.

Lévy&#x27;s 1998 interview apparently gave rise to a new variant of the Marian anecdote. An article published in in August 1998 alleged that it was Lévy himself who was inspired to introduce a Marian element as he walked past a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

An article posted in &quot;La Raison&quot; in February 2000 further connected the donation of a stained glass window for Strasbourg Cathedral by the Council of Europe on 21 October 1956. This window, a work by Parisian master Max Ingrand, shows a blessing Madonna underneath a circle of 12 stars on dark blue ground. The overall design of the Madonna is inspired by the banner of the cathedral&#x27;s &quot;Congrégation Mariale des Hommes&quot;, and the twelve stars are found on the statue venerated by this congregation inside the cathedral (twelve is also the number of members of the congregation&#x27;s council). The Regional Office for Cultural Affairs describe this stained glass window called &quot;Le vitrail de l&#x27;Europe de Max Ingrand&quot; (The Glass Window of Europe of Max Ingrand).

==Specifications==

According to graphical specifications published online by the Council of Europe in 2004, the flag is rectangular with 2:3 proportions: its fly (width) is one and a half times the length of its hoist (height). Twelve yellow stars are centred in a circle (the radius of which is a third of the length of the hoist) upon a blue background. All the stars are upright (one point straight up), have five points and are spaced equally, like the hour positions on the face of a clock. The diameter of each star is equal to one-ninth of the height of the hoist.

The colours are regulated in the 1996 guide by the EC, and equivalently in the 2004 guide by the Council of Europe. The base colour of the flag is defined as Pantone &quot;Reflex Blue&quot;, while the golden stars are portrayed in Pantone &quot;Yellow&quot;:

The 2013 logo of the Council of Europe has the colours:
==Adoption and usage==

The twelve-star &quot;flag of Europe&quot; was designed in 1950 and officially adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955. The same flag was adopted by the European Parliament in 1983. The European Council adopted it as an &quot;emblem&quot; for the European Communities in 1985. Its status in the European Communities was inherited by the European Union upon its formation in 1993. The proposal to adopt it as official flag of the European Union failed with the ratification of the European Constitution in 2005, and mention of all emblems suggesting statehood was removed from the Treaty of Lisbon of 2007, although sixteen member states signed a declaration supporting the continued use of the flag. In 2007, the European Parliament officially adopted the flag for its own use.

===1950–present: Council of Europe===

The Council of Europe in 1950 appointed a committee to study the question of adopting a symbol.
Numerous proposals were looked into.

Among the unsuccessful proposals was the flag of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi&#x27;s International Paneuropean Union, which he had himself recently adopted for the European Parliamentary Union.
The design was a blue field with a red cross inside an orange circle at the centre. 
Kalergi was very committed to defending the cross as &quot;the great symbol of Europe&#x27;s moral unity&quot;, the Red Cross in particular being &quot;recognized by the whole world, by Christian and non-Christian nations[,] as a symbol of international charity and of the brotherhood of man&quot;, but the proposal was rejected by Turkey (a member of the Council of Europe since 1949) on grounds of its religious associations in spite of Kalergi&#x27;s suggestion of adding a crescent alongside the cross to overcome the Muslim objections.

Other proposals included the flag was the European Movement, which had a large green E on a white background,
a design was based on the Olympic rings, eight golden rings on a blue background, rejected due to the rings&#x27; similarity with &quot;dial&quot;, &quot;chain&quot; and &quot;zeros&quot;, or a large yellow star on a blue background, rejected due to its equality with the flag of the Belgian Congo.

The Consultative Assembly narrowed their choice to two designs. One was by Salvador de Madariaga, the founder of the College of Europe, who suggested a constellation of stars on a blue background (positioned according to capital cities, with a large star for Strasbourg, the seat of the council). He had circulated his flag round many European capitals and the concept had found favour. 
The second was a variant by Arsène Heitz, who worked for the council&#x27;s postal service and had submitted dozens of designs, one of which was accepted by the Assembly. The design was similar to Salvador de Madariaga&#x27;s, but rather than a constellation, the stars were arranged in a circle. Arsène Heitz was one of several people who proposed a circle of gold stars on a blue background. None of his proposals perfectly match the design that was adopted. Paul Levy claims that he was the one who designed the template for the flag, not Arsène Heitz.
In 1987, Heitz would claim that his inspiration had been the crown of twelve stars of the Woman of the Apocalypse, often found in Marian iconography (see below).

On 25 September 1953, the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe recommended that a blue flag with fifteen gold stars be adopted as an emblem for the organisation, the number fifteen reflecting the number of states of the Council of Europe. West Germany objected to the fifteen-star design, as one of the members was Saar Protectorate, and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region. The Committee of Ministers (the council&#x27;s main decision-making body) agreed with the Assembly that the flag should be a circle of stars, but opted for a fixed number of twelve stars, &quot;representing perfection and entirety&quot;. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 25 October 1955 agreed to this. Paul M. G. Lévy drew up the exact design of the new flag. Officially adopted on 8 December 1955, the flag was unveiled at the Château de la Muette in Paris on 13 December 1955.

For the flag of the Council of Europe, many stylistic proposals were made in regards to colours and symbolism. These first proposals were made 19 January 1950 by Paul Levy in a letter to the Secretary-General. He proposed that the flag should contain a cross for several reasons. Firstly, the cross symbolizes roads crossing, and also represents the east, the west, the north, and the south with its arms. Furthermore, the cross appears in most of the European Council members&#x27; flags, and it is the oldest and most noble symbol in Europe. Moreover, the cross depicted Christianity. As far as the colours are concerned, he proposed them to be white and green, colours of the European Movement, which was of great significance since 1947. Green also depicted hope, and the green cross over a white background was a design that had not been used yet. Finally, Levy proposed that the arms of Strasbourg was an important element to be added as it represented where the council would be, and being located in the heart of the cross meant that the council was the point where the European roads met.

Shortly after this design considerations by Paul Levy, on 27 July 1950, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, president of the Pan-European movement wrote a memorandum which contained some rules that a flag for such union should follow. The rules he stated where:

* It should be a symbol of our common civilisation.
* It should present a European emblem.
* It should not provoke any national rivalry.
* It should represent tradition.
* It should be beautiful and dignified.

After these statements, Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed that the Pan-European movement flag would be the perfect one to fit these criteria

15 July 1951, the consultative assembly put forward a final memorandum on the European flag. The symbols proposed where the following

* A cross: Symbol of Christianity, Europe&#x27;s crossroads, reminiscent of the crusades, and present in half of the member state&#x27;s flags.
* An &quot;E&quot;: Used by the European Movement.
* A white star in a circle: Symbol used in 1944–45 by the armies of liberation.
* Multiple stars: Each star could represent a member. They could be green on a white background, white stars on a red background, or silver stars for associate members, and golden stars for full members.
* Strasbourg&#x27;s Coat of Arms: To symbolize the official seat of the Council of Europe.
* A sun: It would represent dawning hope.
* A triangle: It would represent culture.

Furthermore, several colours were also proposed:

* Multi-coloured: It was proposed that the flag could contain all the colours the flags of the member states had.
* Green and White: These were the colours of the European Movement.
* Blue: Symbol of peace and neutrality, as other colours were already used for other movements such as black for mourning, red for bolshevism, or green for Islam.

In the end, the flag of Europe was chosen to have 12 five-pointed golden stars in a circle over a blue background, probably inspired by the Pan-European flag and other designs such as Salvador de Madariaga&#x27;s and Arsène Heitz&#x27;s proposals.

===1983–present: From European Communities to European Union===
Following Expo 58 in Brussels, the flag caught on and the Council of Europe lobbied for other European organisations to adopt the flag as a sign of European unity. 
The European Parliament took the initiative in seeking a flag to be adopted by the European Communities. Shortly after the first direct elections in 1979 a draft resolution was put forward on the issue. The resolution proposed that the Communities&#x27; flag should be that of the Council of Europe and it was adopted by the Parliament on 11 April 1983.
The June 1984 European Council (the Communities&#x27; leaders) summit in Fontainebleau stressed the importance of promoting a European image and identity to citizens and the world. The European Council appointed an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee, named &quot;Committee for &#x27;a People&#x27;s Europe&#x27;&quot; (Adonnino Committee).

This committee submitted a substantial report, including wide-ranging suggestions, from organising a &quot;European lottery&quot; to campaigning for the introduction of local voting rights for foreign nationals throughout Europe. Under the header of &quot;strengthening of the Community&#x27;s image and identity&quot;, the Committee suggested the introduction of &quot;a flag and an emblem&quot;, recommending a design based on the Council of Europe flag, but with the addition of &quot;a gold letter E&quot; in the center of the circle of stars. The European Council held in Milan on 28/29 June 1985 largely followed the recommendations of the Adonnino Committee. But as the adoption of a flag was strongly reminiscent of a national flag representing statehood and was extremely controversial with some member states (in particular the United Kingdom, as the proposed flag closely resembled the Queen&#x27;s personal standard), the Council of Europe&#x27;s &quot;flag of Europe&quot; design was adopted, without the letter E, only with the official status of a &quot;logo&quot;. This compromise was widely disregarded from the beginning, and the &quot;European logo&quot;, in spite of the explicit language of giving it the status of a &quot;logo&quot;, was referred to as the &quot;Community flag&quot; or even &quot;European flag&quot; from the outset.

The Communities began to use the &quot;emblem&quot; as its &quot;de facto&quot; flag from 1986, raising it outside the Berlaymont building (the seat of the European Commission) for the first time on 29 May 1986.

The European Union, which was established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to replace the European Communities and encompass its functions, has retained &quot;de facto&quot; use of the &quot;Community logo&quot; of the EC. Technically and officially, the &quot;European flag&quot; as used by the European Union remains not a &quot;flag&quot; but &quot;a Community &#x27;logo&#x27; — or &#x27;emblem&#x27; — [...] eligible to be reproduced on rectangular pieces of fabric&quot;.

In 1997, the &quot;Central and Eastern Eurobarometer&quot; poll included a section intending to &quot;discover the level of public awareness of the European Union&quot; in what were then candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Interviewees were shown &quot;a sticker of the European flag&quot; and asked to identify it. Responses considered correct were: the European Union, the European Community, the Common Market, and &quot;Europe in general&quot;. 52% of those interviewed gave one of the correct answers, 15% gave a wrong answer (naming another institution, such as NATO or the United Nations), and 35% could or would not identify it.
In 2002, Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas designed a symbol, dubbed the &quot;barcode&quot;, which displayed the colours of the national flags of the EU member states in vertical stripes. It was reported as a replacement for the European flag, which was not the intention. It was not adopted by the EU or any other organisation at the time, but an updated version was used in the visual identity of the Austrian EU Presidency in 2006.

The official status of the emblem as the flag of the European Union was to be formalised as part of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. However, as the proposed treaty failed ratification, the mention of all state-like emblems, including the flag, were not included in the replacement Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in 2009.

Instead, a separate declaration by sixteen Member States was included in the final act of the Treaty of Lisbon stating that the flag, the anthem, the motto and the currency and Europe Day &quot;will for them continue as symbols to express the sense of community of the people in the European Union and their allegiance to it.&quot;

In reaction to the removal of the flag from the treaty, the European Parliament, which had supported the inclusion of such symbols, backed a proposal to use these symbols &quot;more often&quot; on behalf of the Parliament itself; Jo Leinen, MEP for Germany, suggested that the Parliament should take &quot;an &quot;avant-garde&quot; role&quot; in their use.

In September 2008, the Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a formal change in the institution&#x27;s rules of procedure to make &quot;better use of the symbols&quot;. Specifically, the flag would be present in all meeting rooms (not just the hemicycle) and at all official events. The proposal was passed on 8 October 2008 by 503 votes to 96 (15 abstentions).

In 2015, a set of commemorative Euro coins was issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the emblem by the European Communities.
In April 2004, the European flag was flown on behalf of the European Space Agency, by Dutch astronaut André Kuipers while on board the International Space Station, in reference to the Framework Agreement establishing the legal basis for co-operation between the European Space Agency and the European Union.

Following the 2004 Summer Olympics, President Romano Prodi expressed his hope &quot;to see the EU Member State teams in Beijing [viz., the 2008 games] carry the flag of the European Union alongside their own national flag as a symbol of our unity&quot;.
Use of the flag has also been reported as representing the European team at the Ryder Cup golf competition in the early 2000s, although most European participants preferred to use their own national flags.

The flag has been widely used by advocates of European integration since the late 1990s or early 2000s. It is often displayed in the context of Europe Day, on 9 May. 
Outside the EU, it was used in the context of several of the &quot;colour revolutions&quot; during the 2000s. In Belarus, it was used on protest marches alongside the white-red-white flag and other flags of opposition movements, such as &quot;Zubr&quot;, during the protests of 2004–2006. The flag was used widely in a 2007 pro-EU march in Minsk. Similar uses were reported from Moldova in 2009.

In Georgia, the flag has been on most government buildings since the coming to power of Mikheil Saakashvili (2007), who used it during his inauguration, stating: &quot;[the European] flag is Georgia&#x27;s flag as well, as far as it embodies our civilisation, our culture, the essence of our history and perspective, and our vision for the future of Georgia.&quot;

It was used in 2008 by pro-western Serbian voters ahead of an election.
The flag became a symbol of European integration of Ukraine in the 2010s, particularly after Euromaidan. Ukraine is not a part of the EU but is a member of the Council of Europe. The flag is used by the Cabinet of Ukraine, Prime Minister of Ukraine, and MFA UA during official meetings. It was flown during the 2013 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine,
and in 2016 by the pro-EU faction in the EU membership referendum campaigns in the United Kingdom.

The flag has also been adopted as a symbol for EU policies and expansionism by EU-sceptics. 
In an early instance, Macedonian protesters burned &quot;the flag of the EU&quot; in the context of EU involvement in the 2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia.
In the 2005 Islamic protests 
against the &quot;Jyllands-Posten Muhammad&quot; cartoons, the Danish flag was most frequently burned, but (as the cartoons were reprinted in many European countries), some protesters opted for burning &quot;the EU flag&quot; instead.
Protesters during the Greek government-debt crisis of 2012 &quot;burned the EU flag and shouted &#x27;EU out&#x27; &quot;.
Burning of the EU flag has been reported from other anti-EU rallies since.

By the 2010s, the association of the emblem with the EU had become so strong that the Council of Europe saw it necessary to design a new logo, to &quot;avoid confusion&quot;, officially adopted in 2013.

The EU emblem (&quot;EU flag&quot;) is depicted on the euro banknotes. Euro coins also display a circle of twelve stars on both the national and common sides.

It is also depicted on many driving licences and vehicle registration plates issued in the Union. Diplomatic missions of EU member states fly the EU flag alongside their national flag. In October 2000, the then-new British Embassy in Berlin sparked controversy between the UK and Germany and the EU when the embassy did not have a second external flagpole for the EU flag. After diplomatic negotiations, it was agreed that the outside flagpole would have the diplomatic Union Flag while inside the embassy, the EU flag would accompany the UK flag. Some member states&#x27; national airlines such as Lufthansa have the EU flag alongside their national flags on aircraft as part of their aircraft registration codes, but this is not an EU-mandated directive.

A number of logos used by EU institutions, bodies and agencies are derived from the design and colours of the EU emblem.

Other emblems make reference to the European flag, such as the EU organic food label that uses the twelve stars but reorders them into the shape of a leaf on a green background. The original logo of the European Broadcasting Union used the twelve stars on a blue background adding ray beams to connect the countries.

There was a proposal in 2003 to deface national civil ensigns with the EU emblem. The proposal was rejected by Parliament in 2004.

The flag is usually flown by the government of the country holding the rotating presidency Council of Ministers.
In 2009, Czech President Václav Klaus, a eurosceptic, refused to fly the flag from his castle. In response, Greenpeace projected an image of the flag onto the castle and attempted to fly the flag from the building themselves.

Extraordinary flying of the flag is common on Europe Day, celebrated annually on 9 May. On Europe Day 2008, the flag was flown for the first time above the German Reichstag.

The flag has also been displayed in the context of EU military operations (EUFOR Althea).

Sixteen out of twenty-seven member states in 2007 signed the declaration recognising &quot;the flag with a circle of twelve golden stars on a blue background&quot; as representing &quot;the sense of community of the people in the European Union and their allegiance to it.&quot;
In 2017, president of France Emmanuel Macron signed a declaration endorsing the 2007 statement,
so that, as of 2018, 17 out of 27 member states have recognised the emblem as a flag representing &quot;allegiance to the EU&quot;:
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.

Italy has incorporated the EU flag into its flag code. According to an Italian law passed in 2000, it is mandatory for most public offices and buildings to hoist the European Flag alongside the Italian national flag (Law 22/1998 and Presidential Decree 121/2000). Outside official use, the flag may not be used for &quot;aims incompatible with European values&quot;.
The 2000 Italian flag code expressly replaces the Italian flag with the European flag in precedence when dignitaries from other EU countries visit – for example the EU flag would be in the middle of a group of three flags rather than the Italian flag. In Germany, the federal flag code of 1996 is only concerned with the German flag, but some of the states have legislated additional provisions for the European flag, such as Bavaria in its flag regulation of 2001, which mandates that the European flag take the third order of precedence, after the federal and state flags, except on Europe Day, where it is to take the first order of precedence.

In Ireland 
on occasions of &quot;European Union Events&quot; (for example, at a European Council meeting), where the European flag is flown alongside all national flags of member states, the national flags are placed in alphabetical order (according to their name in the main language of that state) with the European flag either at the head, or the far-right, of the order of flags.

In most member states, use of the EU flag is only &quot;de facto&quot; and not regulated by legislation, and as such subject to &quot;ad hoc&quot; revision. In national usage, national protocol usually demands the national flag takes precedence over the European flag (which is usually displayed to the right of the national flag from the observer&#x27;s perspective). In November 2014, the speaker of the Hungarian Parliament László Kövér ordered the removal of the EU flag from the parliament building, following an incident in which a member of parliament had &quot;defenestrated&quot; two EU flags from a fourth story window. In November 2015, the newly elected Polish government under Beata Szydło removed the EU flag from government press conferences.

==Derivative designs==
The design of the European flag has been used in a variation, such as that of the Council of Europe mentioned above, and also to a greater extent such as the flag of the Western European Union (WEU; now defunct), which uses the same colours and the stars but has a number of stars based on membership and in a semicircle rather than a circle. It is also defaced with the initials of the former Western European Union in two languages.

The European Parliament used its own flag from 1973, but never formally adopted it. It fell out of use with the adoption of the twelve-star flag by the Parliament in 1983. The flag followed the yellow and blue colour scheme however instead of twelve stars there were the letters EP and PE (initials of the European Parliament in the six community languages at the time) surrounded by a wreath. Sometime later, the Parliament chose to use a logo consisting of a stylised hemicycle and the EU flag at the bottom right.

The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina, imposed by High Representative Carlos Westendorp after the country&#x27;s parliament failed to agree on a design, is reminiscent of the symbolism of the EU flag, using the same blue and yellow colours; also, the stars (although of a different number and colour) are a direct reference to those of the European flag.

Likewise, Kosovo uses blue, yellow and stars in its flag, which has been mocked as a &quot;none too subtle nod to the flag of the European Union, which is about to become Kosovo&#x27;s new best friend as it takes over protector status from the United Nations&quot;.

The flag of the Brussels-Capital Region (introduced in 2016) consists of a yellow iris with a white outline upon a blue background. Its colours are based on the colours of the Flag of Europe, because Brussels is considered the unofficial capital of the EU.

===Heraldry===
The coat of arms of the chairman of the European Union Military Committee (CEUMC), the highest-ranking officer within the EU&#x27;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), depicts the European emblem as a coat of arms, i.e. emblazoned on an escutcheon. In heraldic terms, this makes the European flag is the banner of arms, i.e. the flag form of this coat of arms. In English blazon, the arms is &quot;Azure, a circle of 12 mullets or, their points not touching&quot;.

Several EU publications related to the CSDP generally, and its prospective development as a defence arm, have also displayed the European emblem in this manner, albeit as a graphical design element rather than an official symbol.

<text>The Anthem of Europe or European Anthem, also known as [[Ode to Joy]], is a piece of instrumental music adapted from the prelude of the final movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony composed in 1823, originally set to words adapted from Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s 1785 poem &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. In 1972, the Council of Europe adopted it as an anthem to represent Europe, and later in 1985 it was also adopted by the European Union.

Its purpose is to honour shared European values. The EU describes it as expressing the ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity. The anthem is played on official occasions such as political or civil events.

== History ==

Friedrich Schiller wrote the poem &quot;An die Freude&quot; (&quot;To Joy&quot;) in 1785 as a &quot;celebration of the brotherhood of man&quot;. In later life, the poet was contemptuous of this popularity and dismissed the poem as typical of &quot;the bad taste of the age&quot; in which it had been written. After Schiller&#x27;s death, the poem provided the words for the choral movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony.

In 1971 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe decided to propose adopting the prelude to the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony as the anthem, taking up a suggestion made by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi in 1955. Beethoven was generally seen as the natural choice for a European anthem. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe officially announced the European Anthem on 19 January 1972 at Strasbourg: the prelude to &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s 9th symphony.

Conductor Herbert von Karajan was asked to write three instrumental arrangementsfor solo piano, for wind instruments and for symphony orchestra and he conducted the performance used to make the official recording. Karajan decided on a decidedly slower tempo, using crotchet (quarter note) = 120 whereas Beethoven had written minim (half note) = 80.

The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on Europe Day in 1972, without a public holiday, since it is close to May Day. In 1985, it was adopted by EU heads of state and government as the official anthem of the then European Communitysince 1993 the European Union. It is not intended to replace the national anthems of the member states but rather to celebrate the values they all share and their unity in diversity. It expresses the ideals of a united Europe: freedom, peace, and solidarity.

It was to have been included in the European Constitution along with the other European symbols; however, the treaty failed ratification and was replaced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which does not include any symbols. A declaration was attached to the treaty, in which sixteen member states formally recognised the proposed symbols. In response, the European Parliament decided that it would make greater use of the anthem, for example at official occasions. In October 2008, the Parliament changed its rules of procedure to have the anthem played at the opening of Parliament after elections and at formal sittings.

== Usage ==
&quot;Ode to Joy&quot; is the anthem of the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Union (EU). In the context of the CoE, the anthem is used to represent all of Europe. In the context of the EU, the anthem is used to represent the union and its people. It is used on occasions such as Europe Day and formal events such as the signing of treaties. The European Parliament seeks to make greater use of the music; then-Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering stated he was moved when the anthem was played for him on his visit to Israel and ought to be used in Europe more often.

The German public radio station Deutschlandfunk has broadcast the anthem together with the shortly before midnight since New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006. The two anthems were specially recorded by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra in versions characterized by &quot;modesty and intensity&quot;.

At the 2007 signing ceremony for the Treaty of Lisbon, the plenipotentiaries of the European Union&#x27;s twenty-seven member states stood in attendance while the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; was played and a choir of 26 Portuguese children sang the original German lyrics.

In 2008 it was used by Kosovo as its national anthem until it adopted its own, and it was played at its declaration of independence, as a nod to the EU&#x27;s role in its independence from Serbia.

&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, automatically orchestrated in seven different styles, was used on 18 June 2015 during the ceremony celebrating the 5000th ERC grantee as anthem of the European Research Council to represent achievements of European research.

&quot;Ode to Joy&quot; is used as the theme song to the 2016 UEFA Euro qualifying and the European qualifying of the 2018 FIFA World Cup football competition at the introduction of every match.

In 2017, members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from the Scottish National Party first whistled and then sang &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; during a vote at the House of Commons to protest against Brexit.

In 2018, the anthem of Japan and the anthem of the EU were performed in Tokyo during the official signing of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. The European anthem is often played at the signing of official economic or political agreements with foreign governments.
In 2023, it was played after the anthem of Ukraine during President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s visit to the EU parliament.

<doc id="10029" wikidata="Q3138223" url="?curid=10029" title="Timeline of the evolutionary history of life">
<text>The timeline of the evolutionary history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events during the development of life on planet Earth. Dates in this article are consensus estimates based on scientific evidence, mainly fossils.

In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms imply a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged. More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived (over five billion) are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth&#x27;s current species range from 10 million to 14 million, with about 1.2 million or 14% documented, the rest not yet described. However, a 2016 report estimates an additional 1 trillion microbial species, with only 0.001% described.

There has been controversy between more traditional views of steadily increasing biodiversity, and a newer view of cycles of annihilation and diversification, so that certain past times, such as the Cambrian explosion, experienced maximums of diversity followed by sharp winnowing.

Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. At long irregular intervals, Earth&#x27;s biosphere suffers a catastrophic die-off, a mass extinction, often comprising an accumulation of smaller extinction events over a relatively brief period.

The first known mass extinction was the Great Oxidation Event 2.4 billion years ago, which killed most of the planet&#x27;s obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five other major extinction events in Earth&#x27;s history, with estimated losses below:

*End Ordovician: 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including graptolites
*Late Devonian: 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including most trilobites
*End Permian, The Great Dying: 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including tabulate corals, and most trees and synapsids
*End Triassic: 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all conodonts
*End Cretaceous: 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all ammonites, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and nonavian dinosaurs

Smaller extinction events have occurred in the periods between, with some dividing geologic time periods and epochs. The Holocene extinction event is currently under way.

Factors in mass extinctions include continental drift, changes in atmospheric and marine chemistry, volcanism and other aspects of mountain formation, changes in glaciation, changes in sea level, and impact events.

== Detailed timeline ==
In this timeline, Ma (for &quot;megaannum&quot;) means &quot;million years ago,&quot; ka (for &quot;kiloannum&quot;) means &quot;thousand years ago,&quot; and ya means &quot;years ago.&quot;

=== Hadean Eon ===
4540 Ma – 4031 Ma

=== Archean Eon ===

4031 Ma – 2500 Ma

=== Proterozoic Eon ===

2500 Ma – 539 Ma. Contains the Palaeoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras.

=== Phanerozoic Eon ===

539 Ma – present

The Phanerozoic Eon (Greek: period of well-displayed life) marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and/or trace-making organisms. It is subdivided into three eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, with major mass extinctions at division points.

==== Palaeozoic Era ====
538.8 Ma – 251.9 Ma and contains the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian periods.



==== Mesozoic Era ====


From 251.9 Ma to 66 Ma and containing the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
==== Cenozoic Era ====
66 Ma – present
