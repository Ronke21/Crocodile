<text>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (), set by France&#x27;s National Constituent Assembly in 1789, is a human and civil rights document from the French Revolution; the French title can be translated in the modern era as &quot;Declaration of Human and Civic Rights&quot;. Inspired by Enlightenment philosophers, the declaration was a core statement of the values of the French Revolution and had a significant impact on the development of popular conceptions of individual liberty and democracy in Europe and worldwide.

The declaration was initially drafted by Marquis de Lafayette with assistance from Thomas Jefferson, but the majority of the final draft came from Abbé Sieyès. Influenced by the doctrine of natural right, human rights are held to be universal: valid at all times and in every place. It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by the law. It is included at the beginning of the constitutions of both the French Fourth Republic (1946) and French Fifth Republic (1958) and is considered valid as constitutional law.

==History==
The content of the document emerged largely from the ideals of the Enlightenment. Marquis de Lafayette prepared the principal drafts in consultation with his close friend Thomas Jefferson. In August 1789, Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès and Honoré Mirabeau played a central role in conceptualizing and drafting the final Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

The last article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was adopted on 26 August 1789 by the National Constituent Assembly, during the period of the French Revolution, as the first step toward writing a constitution for France. Inspired by the Enlightenment, the original version of the declaration was discussed by the representatives based on a 24-article draft proposed by , led by Jérôme Champion de Cicé. The draft was later modified during the debates. A second and lengthier declaration, known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793, was written in 1793 but never formally adopted.

==Background==
The concepts in the declaration come from the philosophical and political duties of the Enlightenment, such as individualism, the social contract as theorized by the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the separation of powers espoused by the Baron de Montesquieu. As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration was heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment and principles of human rights, as was the U.S. Declaration of Independence which preceded it (4 July 1776).

These principles were shared widely throughout European society, rather than being confined to a small elite as in the past. This took different forms, such as &#x27;English coffeehouse culture&#x27;, and extended to areas colonised by Europeans, particularly British North America. Contacts between diverse groups in Edinburgh, Geneva, Boston, Amsterdam, Paris, London, or Vienna were much greater than often appreciated.

Transnational elites who shared ideas and styles were not new; what changed was their extent and the numbers involved. Under Louis XIV, Versailles was the centre of French culture, fashion and political power. Improvements in education and literacy over the course of the 18th century meant larger audiences for newspapers and journals, with Masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs providing areas where people could debate and discuss ideas. The emergence of this &quot;public sphere&quot; led to Paris replacing Versailles as the cultural and intellectual centre, leaving the Court isolated and less able to influence opinion.

Assisted by Jefferson, then American diplomat to France, Lafayette prepared a draft which echoed some of the provisions of the U.S. declaration. However, there was no consensus on the role of the Crown, and until this question was settled it was impossible to create political institutions. When presented to the legislative committee on 11 July 1789, it was rejected by pragmatists such as Jean Joseph Mounier, President of the Assembly, who feared creating expectations that could not be satisfied.

Conservatives like Gérard de Lally-Tollendal wanted a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king who would have the right of veto. On 10 September, the majority led by Sieyès and Talleyrand rejected this in favour of a single assembly, while Louis XVI retained only a &quot;suspensive veto&quot;; this meant he could delay the implementation of a law but not block it. With these questions settled, a new committee was convened to agree on a constitution; the most controversial remaining issue was citizenship, itself linked to the debate on the balance between individual rights and obligations. Ultimately, the 1791 Constitution distinguished between active citizens and passive citizens. As a result, it was never fully accepted by radicals in the Jacobin club.

After editing by Mirabeau, it was published on 26 August as a statement of principle. The final draft contained provisions then considered radical in any European society, let alone France in 1789. French historian Georges Lefebvre argues that combined with the elimination of privilege and feudalism, it &quot;highlighted equality in a way the (American Declaration of Independence) did not&quot;. More importantly, the two differed in intent; Jefferson saw the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights as fixing the political system at a specific point in time, claiming they &#x27;contained no original thought...but expressed the American mind&#x27; at that stage. The 1791 French Constitution was viewed as a starting point, the declaration providing an aspirational vision, a key difference between the two revolutions. Attached as a preamble to the French Constitution of 1791, and that of the 1870 to 1940 French Third Republic, it was incorporated into the current Constitution of France in 1958.

==Summary of principles==

The declaration defines a single set of individual and collective rights for all men. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights are held to be universal and valid in all times and places. For example, &quot;Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.&quot; They have certain natural rights to property, to liberty, and to life. According to this theory, the role of government is to recognize and secure these rights. Furthermore, the government should be carried on by elected representatives.

When it was written, the rights contained in the declaration were only awarded to men. Furthermore, the declaration was a statement of vision rather than reality. The declaration was not deeply rooted in either the practice of the West or even France at the time. The declaration emerged in the late 18th century out of war and revolution. It encountered opposition, as democracy and individual rights were frequently regarded as synonymous with anarchy and subversion. This declaration embodies ideals and aspirations towards which France pledged to struggle in the future.

==Substance==

The declaration is introduced by a preamble describing the fundamental characteristics of the rights, which are qualified as &quot;natural, unalienable and sacred&quot; and &quot;simple and incontestable principles&quot; on which citizens could base their demands. In the second article, &quot;the natural and imprescriptible rights of man&quot; are defined as &quot;liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression&quot;. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to feudalism and to exemptions from taxation, freedom, and equal rights for all &quot;Men&quot; and access to public office based on talent. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens had the right to participate in the legislative process. Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed.

The declaration also asserts the principles of popular sovereignty, in contrast to the divine right of kings that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, &quot;All the citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents,&quot; eliminating the special rights of the nobility and clergy.

===Articles===


Article I – Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.

Article II – The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.

Article III – The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation. No body, no individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.

Article IV – Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law.

Article V – The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society. Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

Article VI – The law is the expression of the general will. All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation. It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes. All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.

Article VII – No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.

Article VIII – The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.

Article IX – Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.

Article X – No one may be disquieted for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

Article XI – The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

Article XII – The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.

Article XIII – For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed to all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

Article XIV – Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

Article XV – The society has the right of requesting an account from any public agent of its administration.

Article XVI – Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no constitution.

Article XVII – Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

===Active and passive citizenship===

While the French Revolution provided rights to a larger portion of the population, there remained a distinction between those who obtained the political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and those who did not. Those who were deemed to hold these political rights were called active citizens. Active citizenship was granted to men who were French, at least 25 years old, paid taxes equal to three days work, and could not be defined as servants. This meant that at the time of the declaration, only male property owners held these rights. The deputies in the National Assembly believed that only those who held tangible interests in the nation could make informed political decisions. This distinction directly affects articles 6, 12, 14, and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, as each of these rights is related to the right to vote and to participate actively in the government. With the decree of 29 October 1789, the term active citizen became embedded in French politics.

The concept of passive citizens was created to encompass those populations excluded from political rights in the declaration. Because of the requirements set down for active citizens, the vote was granted to approximately 4.3 million Frenchmen out of a population of around 29 million. These omitted groups included women, the poor, domestic servants, enslaved people, children, and foreigners. As the General Assembly voted upon these measures, they limited the rights of certain groups of citizens while implementing the democratic process of the French First Republic. This legislation, passed in 1789, was amended by the creators of the Constitution of the Year III to eliminate the label of an active citizen. The power to vote was then, however, to be granted solely to substantial property owners.

Tensions arose between active and passive citizens throughout the revolution. This happened when passive citizens started to call for more rights or openly refused to listen to the ideals set forth by active citizens. Women in particular were strong passive citizens who played a significant role in the revolution. Olympe de Gouges penned her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen in 1791 and drew attention to the need for gender equality. By supporting the ideals of the French Revolution and wishing to expand them to women, she represented herself as a revolutionary citizen. Madame Roland also established herself as an influential figure throughout the revolution. She saw women of the French Revolution as holding three roles; &quot;inciting revolutionary action, formulating policy, and informing others of revolutionary events.&quot; By working with men, as opposed to working apart from men, she may have been able to further the fight for revolutionary women. As players in the French Revolution, women occupied a significant role in the civic sphere by forming social movements and participating in popular clubs, allowing them societal influence, despite their lack of direct political power.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
The declaration recognizes many rights as belonging to citizens (who could only be male). This was despite the fact that after the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles on 5 October 1789, women presented the Women&#x27;s Petition to the National Assembly in which they proposed a decree giving women equal rights. In 1790, Nicolas de Condorcet and Etta Palm d&#x27;Aelders unsuccessfully called on the National Assembly to extend civil and political rights to women. Condorcet declared &quot;he who votes against the right of another, whatever the religion, color, or sex of that other, has henceforth abjured his own&quot;. The French Revolution did not lead to a recognition of women&#x27;s rights, and this prompted de Gouges to publish her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen in September 1791, modeled after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. It is ironic in the formulation and exposes the failure of the French Revolution, which had been devoted to equality. It states: &quot;This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights, they have lost in society.&quot;

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen follows the 17 articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point. Camille Naish has described it as &quot;almost a parody... of the original document&quot;. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that &quot;Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.&quot; The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replies: &quot;Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility&quot;. De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law, women were fully punishable yet denied equal rights, declaring, &quot;Women have the right to mount the scaffold, they must also have the right to mount the speaker&#x27;s rostrum&quot;.

===Slavery===
The declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery in the French colonies, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot&#x27;s &quot;Les Amis des Noirs&quot; and opposed by the group of colonial planters called the Club Massiac, because they met at the Hôtel Massiac. Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the declaration, it inspired the slave uprisings in Saint-Domingue in the Haitian Revolution, as discussed in C. L. R. James&#x27;s history of the Haitian Revolution, &quot;The Black Jacobins&quot;. In Louisiana, the organizers of the Pointe Coupée Slave Conspiracy of 1795 also drew information from the declaration.

Deplorable conditions for the thousands of enslaved people in Saint-Domingue, the most profitable slave colony in the world, led to the uprisings known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World. Free persons of color were part of the first wave of revolt, but later formerly enslaved people took control. In 1794, the convention was dominated by the Jacobins and abolished slavery, including in the colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe. However, Napoleon reinstated it in 1802 and attempted to regain control of Saint-Domingue by sending in thousands of troops. After suffering the losses of two-thirds of the men, many to yellow fever, the French withdrew from Saint-Domingue in 1803. Napoleon gave up on North America and agreed to the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. In 1804, the leaders of Saint-Domingue declared it an independent state, the Republic of Haiti, the second republic of the New World. Napoleon abolished the slave trade in 1815. Slavery in France was finally abolished in 1848.

===Homosexuality===
The vast amount of personal freedom given to citizens by the document created a situation where homosexuality was decriminalized by the French Penal Code of 1791, which covered felonies; the law simply failed to mention sodomy as a crime, and thus no one could be prosecuted for it. The 1791 Code of Municipal Police did provide misdemeanor penalties for &quot;gross public indecency,&quot; which the police could use to punish anyone having sex in public places or otherwise violating social norms. This approach to punishing homosexual conduct was reiterated in the French Penal Code of 1810.

<doc id="8218" wikidata="Q45575" url="?curid=8218" title="Dennis Ritchie">
<text>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and the Unix operating system and B language with long-time colleague Ken Thompson. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1983, the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1990, and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.

Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.

== Early life and education ==
Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of &quot;The Design of Switching Circuits&quot; on switching circuit theory. As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated from Summit High School. He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics in 1963.

== Career ==
In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center. In 1968, he completed a draft of his PhD thesis on &quot;Computational Complexity and Program Structure&quot; at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree. In 2020, the Computer History Museum worked with Ritchie&#x27;s family and Fischer&#x27;s family and found a copy of the lost dissertation.

During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name &quot;Unix&quot;, a pun on the name &quot;Multics&quot;. To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.

During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters. Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle applied to machines still in use by foreign governments.

Ritchie was also involved with the development of the operating systems Plan 9 and Inferno, and the programming language Limbo.

As part of an AT&amp;T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.

== C and Unix ==

Ritchie created the C programming language and was one of the developers of the Unix operating system. With Brian Kernighan, he co-wrote the book &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, which is often referred to as &quot;K&amp;R&quot; after their initials. Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie&#x27;s contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms. They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, &quot;The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.&quot;

Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, operating system, and embedded system development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. C is a low-level language with constructs closely translating to the hardware&#x27;s instruction set. However, it is not tied to any given hardware, making it easy to write programs on any machine that supports C. Moreover, C is a high-level programming language with constructs mapping to data structures in application software.

C influenced several other languages and derivatives, such as C++, Objective-C used by Apple, C# used by Microsoft, and Java used in corporate environments extensively and by Android. Ritchie and Thompson used C to write Unix, which has been influential in establishing many computing concepts and principles that are adopted widely.

In an interview from 1999, Ritchie clarified that he saw Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:

In the same interview, he stated that he viewed Unix and Linux as &quot;the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago.&quot;

== Awards ==
In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award &quot;for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system&quot;. Ritchie&#x27;s Turing Award lecture was titled &quot;Reflections on Software Research&quot;. In 1990, both Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), &quot;for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language&quot;.

In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, &quot;for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.&quot;

On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, &quot;led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age&quot;.

In 2005, the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.

In 2011, Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.

==Death==
Ritchie was found dead on October 12, 2011, at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike. He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease. News of Ritchie&#x27;s death was largely overshadowed by the media coverage of the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, which occurred the week before.

==Legacy==
Following Ritchie&#x27;s death, computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi stated:

In an interview shortly after Ritchie&#x27;s death, long-time colleague Brian Kernighan said Ritchie never expected C to be so significant.
Kernighan told &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;The tools that Dennis built—and their direct descendants—run pretty much everything today.&quot; Kernighan reminded readers of how important a role C and Unix had played in the development of later high-profile projects, such as the iPhone. Other testimonials to his influence followed.

Reflecting upon his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of Steve Jobs and Ritchie, concluding that &quot;[Ritchie&#x27;s] work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune.&quot; Another commentator said, &quot;Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true.&quot; Another said, &quot;many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie&#x27;s importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing...&quot;

The Fedora 16 Linux distribution, which was released about a month after he died, was dedicated to his memory. FreeBSD 9.0, released January 12, 2012, was also dedicated in his memory.

Asteroid 294727 Dennisritchie, discovered by astronomers Tom Glinos and David H. Levy in 2008, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 7 February 2012 (Minor Planet Circulars (M.P.C.) 78272).

<text>The Doctrine and Covenants (sometimes abbreviated and cited as D&amp;C or D. and C.) is a part of the open scriptural canon of several denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. Originally published in 1835 as Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God, editions of the book continue to be printed mainly by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints [RLDS Church]).

The book originally contained two parts: a sequence of lectures setting forth basic church doctrine, followed by a compilation of revelations, or &quot;covenants&quot; of the church: thus the name &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot;. The &quot;doctrine&quot; portion of the book, however, has been removed by both the LDS Church and Community of Christ. The remaining portion of the book contains revelations on numerous topics, most of which were dictated by the movement&#x27;s founder Joseph Smith, supplemented by materials periodically added by each denomination.

Controversy has existed between the two largest denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement over some sections added to the 1876 LDS edition, attributed to founder Smith. Whereas the LDS Church believes these sections to have been revelations to Smith, the RLDS Church traditionally disputed their authenticity.

==History==
The Doctrine and Covenants was first published in 1835 as a later version of the Book of Commandments, which had been partially printed in 1833. This earlier book contained 65 early revelations to church leaders, notably Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Before many copies of the book could be printed, the printing press and most of the printed copies were destroyed by a mob in Missouri.

On September 24, 1834, a committee was appointed by the general assembly of the church to organize a new volume containing the most significant revelations. This committee of Presiding Elders, consisting of Smith, Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, began to review and revise numerous revelations for inclusion in the new work. The committee eventually organized the book into two parts: a &quot;Doctrine&quot; part and a &quot;Covenants&quot; part.

The &quot;Doctrine&quot; part of the book consisted of a theological course now called the &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot;. The lectures were a series of doctrinal courses used in the School of the Prophets which had recently been completed in Kirtland, Ohio. According to the committee, these lectures were included in the compilation &quot;in consequence of their embracing the important doctrine of salvation.&quot;
The &quot;Covenants&quot; part of the book, labeled &quot;Covenants and Commandments of the Lord, to his servants of the church of the Latter Day Saints&quot;, contained a total of 103 revelations. These 103 revelations were said to &quot;contain items or principles for the regulation of the church, as taken from the revelations which have been given since its organization, as well as from former ones.&quot; Each of the 103 revelations was assigned a &quot;section number&quot;; however, section 66 was mistakenly used twice. Thus, the sections of the original work were numbered only to 102.

On February 17, 1835, after the committee had selected the book&#x27;s contents, the committee wrote that the resulting work represents &quot;our belief, and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society as a body.&quot;

The book was first introduced to the church body in a general conference on August 17, 1835. Smith and Williams, two of the Presiding Elders on the committee, were absent, but Cowdery and Rigdon were present. The church membership at the time had not yet seen the Doctrine and Covenants manuscript as it had been compiled and revised solely by the committee; however, various church members who were familiar with the work &quot;bore record&quot; of the book&#x27;s truth. At the end of the conference, the church &quot;by a unanimous vote&quot; agreed to accept the compilation as &quot;the doctrine and covenants of their faith&quot; and to make arrangements for its printing.

In 1835, the book was printed and published under the title &quot;Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God&quot;.

A copy of the Doctrine and Covenants from NASA photographer M. Edward Thomas traveled to the moon and back in 1972 with astronaut John Young aboard Apollo 16.

==LDS Church editions==
In the LDS Church, The Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands alongside the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Pearl of Great Price as scripture. Together the LDS Church&#x27;s scriptures are referred to as the &quot;standard works&quot;. The LDS Church&#x27;s version of the Doctrine and Covenants is described by the church as &quot;containing revelations given to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, with some additions by his successors in the Presidency of the Church.&quot;

===Sections Included in LDS edition===
The 138 sections and two official declarations in LDS Church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:
*Sections 1–134, 137: From the presidency of Joseph Smith (1828–44)
*Sections 135–136: During the administration of the Quorum of the Twelve (1844–47)
*Official Declaration 1: From the presidency of Wilford Woodruff (1889–98)
*Section 138: From the presidency of Joseph F. Smith (1901–18)
*Official Declaration 2: From the presidency of Spencer W. Kimball (1973–85)

The following sections consist of letters, reports, statements, and other similar documents: 102, 123, 127–131, 134, 135, and Official Declarations 1 and 2.

===1844 Edition===

In 1844, the church added eight sections not included in the 1835 edition. In the current edition, these added sections are numbered 103, 105, 112, 119, 124, 127, 128, and 135.

===1876 Edition===

In 1876, a new LDS Church edition renumbered most of the sections in a roughly chronological order instead of the earlier topical order, and included 26 sections not included in previous editions, now numbered as sections 2, 13, 77, 85, 87, 108–111, 113–118, 120–123, 125, 126, 129–132, and 136. Previous editions had been divided into verses with the early versifications generally following the paragraph structure of the original text. It was with the 1876 edition that the currently used versification was first employed.

In 1876, section 101 from the 1835 edition (and subsequent printings) was removed. Section 101 was a &quot;Statement on Marriage&quot; as adopted by an 1835 conference of the church, and contained the following text: 
This section was removed because it had been superseded by section 132 of the modern LDS edition, recorded in 1843, which contains a revelation received by Joseph Smith on eternal marriage and plural marriage, the origin of the principles of which the LDS Church traces to as early as 1831.

During the 1880s, five foreign editions contained two revelations to John Taylor that were received in 1882 and 1883; these revelations &quot;set in order&quot; the priesthood, gave more clarification about the roles of priesthood offices—especially the seventy—and required &quot;men who ... preside over my priesthood&quot; to live plural marriage in order to qualify to hold their church positions. Due to the LDS Church&#x27;s change in attitude to polygamy in 1890, these sections were not included in future English editions of the Doctrine and Covenants.

===1921 Edition===

In 1921, the LDS Church removed the &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot; portion of the book, with an explanation that the lectures &quot;were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons&quot;. The lectures contain theology concerning the Godhead and emphasize the importance of faith and works.

===Latter-day Revelation===

In 1930, a small volume edited by apostle James E. Talmage titled &quot;Latter-day Revelation: Selections from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants&quot; was published, which was a highly edited selective version of the Doctrine and Covenants printed in paragraph format rather than verses. Talmage wrote that the book&#x27;s purpose was &quot;to make the strictly doctrinal parts of the Doctrine and Covenants of easy access and reduce its bulk&quot; by including only &quot;the sections comprising scriptures of general and enduring value&quot;. Ninety-five of the sections of the Doctrine and Covenants were completely omitted—most notably section 132 on plural and celestial marriage—along with parts of 21 others. Twenty complete sections were retained along with parts of 21 others. Fundamentalist Mormons were offended, particularly at the exclusion of section 132, and accused the church of &quot;changing the scriptures.&quot; As a result, church president Heber J. Grant ordered the withdrawal of the book from sale with the remaining copies shredded in order to &quot;avoid further conflict with the fundamentalists&quot;.

===1981 Edition===

Sections 137 and 138 were added to the LDS Church&#x27;s 1981 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is the edition currently in use by the church. These were accounts of two visions, one from Joseph Smith in 1837 and the other from his nephew, Joseph F. Smith, in 1918. The revelations were earlier accepted as scripture when added to the Pearl of Great Price in April 1976. No new revelatory sections have been added since 1981.

The LDS Church&#x27;s 1981 edition contains two &quot;Official Declarations&quot; at the book&#x27;s conclusion. The 1890 Official Declaration 1 ended the church-authorized practice of plural marriage, and the 1978 Official Declaration 2 announces the opening of priesthood ordination to all worthy male members without regard to race or color. The two Official Declarations are not revelations, but they serve as the formal announcements that a revelation was received. In neither case is the revelation included in the Doctrine and Covenants. The text of Official Declaration 1 has been included in every LDS Church printing of the Doctrine and Covenants since 1908.

Until 1981, editions of the book used code names for certain people and places in those sections that dealt with the United Order. The 1981 LDS edition replaced these with the real names, relegating the code names to footnotes. The Community of Christ edition still uses the code names.

===2013 Edition===
A new edition was released in 2013. Changes included adjustments and corrections to the book&#x27;s introduction and section introductions. The changes reflect the modern scholarship that came from &quot;The Joseph Smith Papers&quot;.

==Community of Christ editions==
Officials of the Community of Christ (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints [RLDS Church]) first published an edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1864, based on the previous 1844 edition. A general conference of the church in 1878 approved a resolution that declared that the revelations of the Prophet-President Joseph Smith III had equal standing to those previously included in the work. Since that time, the church has continued to add sections to its edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, containing the revelations of succeeding Prophet-Presidents. The most recent addition was formally authorized on April 14, 2010, after being presented to the church for informal consideration on January 17, 2010. The numbers of the sections and versification differ from the edition published by the LDS Church and both modern editions differ from the original 1835 edition numeration.

===Sections added to the Community of Christ edition===
The 167 sections of the Community of Christ&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:
*Sections 1–113 (includes 108A): From the presidency of Joseph Smith (1828–44)
*Sections 114–131: From the presidency of Joseph Smith III (1860–1914)
*Sections 132–138: From the presidency of Frederick M. Smith (1914–46)
*Sections 139–144: From the presidency of Israel A. Smith (1946–58)
*Sections 145–152 (includes 149A): From the presidency of W. Wallace Smith (1958–78)
*Sections 153–160: From the presidency of Wallace B. Smith (1978–96)
*Sections 161–162: From the presidency of W. Grant McMurray (1996–2004)
*Sections 163–165: From the presidency of Stephen M. Veazey (2005–)

The following sections are not revelations, but letters, reports, statements, and other similar documents: 99, 108A, 109–113, and 123.

Based on the above, the number of revelations (accounting for sections that are not revelations) presented by each Community of Christ president, are as follows:

*Joseph Smith: 107
*Joseph Smith III: 17
*Frederick M. Smith: 7
*Israel A. Smith: 6
*W. Wallace Smith: 9
*Wallace B. Smith: 8
*W. Grant McMurray: 2
*Stephen M. Veazey: 3

===Portions removed from the Community of Christ edition===
The Community of Christ removed the &quot;Lectures on Faith&quot; in 1897. The 1970 World Conference concluded that several sections that had been added between the 1835 and 1844 editions—mainly dealing with the subjects of temple worship and baptism for the dead—had been published without proper approval of a church conference. As a result, the World Conference removed sections 107, 109, 110, 113, and 123 to a historical appendix, which also includes documents that were never published as sections. Of these, only section 107 was a revelation. The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 108A contained the minutes of a business meeting, which, because of its historical nature, was moved to the Introduction in the 1970s. After 1990, the Introduction was updated, and what was section 108A was removed entirely.

====Developments in 2023 and 2024====

A proposal to decanonize and move it to historical records was debated at the 2023 World Conference, which voted to refer the issue to the First Presidency. Section 116 had been received by Joseph Smith III in 1865, shortly after the conclusion of the American Civil War, and stipulates that men of all ethnic backgrounds should be ordained (contrast the LDS Church policy at the time forbidding Black ordination), but hedges this with caution against taking a &quot;hasty&quot; or indiscriminate attitude in ordination of men of the &quot;Negro race&quot;, noting that many of the existing priesthood holders had failed to adequately fulfill their responsibilities. After consulting with Black priesthood members, the First Presidency decided to retain it, so as not to appear to be sanitising the church&#x27;s history.

The Diversity and Inclusion team and the Church History and Sacred Story team were opposed to removing the section, arguing that it represented an important historical step towards inclusivity. The Church History and Sacred Story team, moreover, opined that the removal of sections 107, 109, 110, 113, and 123 had been a &quot;mistake&quot; based on &quot;naive misunderstandings&quot; of scripture and revelation, arguing that many other scriptural texts contain sexist, racist and violent language as a result of the backgrounds and biases of the writers, and that responsible interpretation of scripture needs to take this into account when seeking to discern God&#x27;s will.

The outcome of the process was a rewritten section preface, giving better historical context and stipulating the overarching interpretation &quot;to ordain people of all ethnicities while emphasizing careful discernment of calling, commitment and timing (compare to 156:9d)&quot;, and a minor re-versification, making the closing sentence (&quot;Be ye content, I the Lord have spoken it.&quot;) a separate verse (D&amp;C 116:5) to more accurately reflect the paragraph breaks in the earliest manuscripts of the section, and clarify that it applies to the section as a whole, rather than specifically to the caution against &quot;hasty&quot; ordination.

===Doctrinal developments in the Community of Christ edition===
The ongoing additions to the Community of Christ edition provide a record of the leadership changes and doctrinal developments within the denomination. When W. Grant McMurray became Prophet-President, he declared that instruction specific to leadership changes would no longer be included, so that the focus of the work could be more doctrinal in nature, and less administrative. The record of these leadership changes are still maintained in the form of published &quot;letters of counsel.&quot; Prophet-President Stephen M. Veazey has conformed to this pattern. Although these letters are not formally published in the Doctrine and Covenants, they are still deemed to be inspired, and are dealt with in the same manner that revelations are (that is, they must be deliberated and approved by the voting members of a World Conference).

A modern revelation that resulted in some &quot;disaffection&quot; and &quot;led to intense conflict in scattered areas of the RLDS Church&quot; is contained in the Community of Christ version&#x27;s section 156, presented by Prophet–President Wallace B. Smith and added in 1984, which called for the ordination of women to the priesthood and set out the primary purpose of temples to be &quot;the pursuit of peace&quot;. A resulting schism over the legitimacy of these change led to the formation of the Restoration Branches movement, the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

While some of the prose in the new revelations seems designed to guide the denomination on matters of church governance and doctrine, others are seen as inspirational. One such example can be cited from section 161, presented as counsel to the church by W. Grant McMurray in 1996: &quot;Become a people of the Temple—those who see violence but proclaim peace, who feel conflict yet extend the hand of reconciliation, who encounter broken spirits and find pathways for healing.&quot;

==Editions used by other denominations==
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) uses the 1846 edition that was published in Nauvoo, Illinois; this version is virtually identical to the 1844 edition. Most recently a facsimile reprint was produced for the church at Voree, Wisconsin by Richard Drew in 1993.

The Church of Christ (Temple Lot) contends that the thousands of changes made to the original revelations as published in the Book of Commandments (including the change of the church&#x27;s name) are not doctrinal and result from Joseph Smith&#x27;s fall from his original calling. As a result, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) prefers to use reprints of the Book of Commandments text.

The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) accepts the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, including the Lectures on Faith, which it insists are as much inspired as the revelations themselves.

The Restoration Branches generally use the older RLDS Church Doctrine and Covenants, typically sections 1–144.

The Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints uses the older RLDS Church version of the Doctrine and Covenants up to section 144, and also 19 new revelations from their previous president, Frederick Niels Larsen.

&quot;Remnant&quot; movement, a spiritual movement in schism with the LDS Church, published an online &quot;Restoration&quot; edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 2017. It includes any sections authored by Joseph Smith. It also: includes a new version of D&amp;C 54, as revised by Denver Snuffer; excludes the Kirtland Temple visitation by Elijah and other angelic beings in D&amp;C 110; excludes portions based on fragmentary teachings by Smith in D&amp;C 129; includes Smith&#x27;s Lectures on Faith; and includes a new appendix titled, &quot;A Prophet’s Prerogative,&quot; by Jeff Savage.

==Chart comparison of editions==
The following chart compares the current editions of the Doctrine and Covenants used by the LDS Church (LDS ed.) and Community of Christ (CofC ed.) with the 1833 Book of Commandments (BofC), the 1835 edition published in Kirtland, and the 1844 edition published in Nauvoo. Unless otherwise specified, the document is styled a &quot;revelation&quot; of the person delivering it.

<doc id="8221" wikidata="Q4" url="?curid=8221" title="Death">
<text>Death is the end of life; the irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death. Death eventually and inevitably occurs in all organisms. Some organisms, such as &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, are biologically immortal; however, they can still die from means other than aging. Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the equivalent for individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis. Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said &quot;to die&quot;, as a virus is not considered alive in the first place.

As of the early 21st century, 56 million people die per year. The most common reason is aging, followed by cardiovascular disease, which is a disease that affects the heart or blood vessels. As of 2022, an estimated total of almost 110 billion humans have died, or roughly 94% of all humans to have ever lived. A substudy of gerontology known as biogerontology seeks to eliminate death by natural aging in humans, often through the application of natural processes found in certain organisms. However, as humans do not have the means to apply this to themselves, they have to use other ways to reach the maximum lifespan for a human, often through lifestyle changes, such as calorie reduction, dieting, and exercise. The idea of lifespan extension is considered and studied as a way for people to live longer.

Determining when a person has definitively died has proven difficult. Initially, death was defined as occurring when breathing and the heartbeat ceased, a status still known as clinical death. However, the development of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) meant that such a state was no longer strictly irreversible. Brain death was then considered a more fitting option, but several definitions exist for this. Some people believe that all brain functions must cease. Others believe that even if the brainstem is still alive, the personality and identity are irretrievably lost, so therefore, the person should be considered entirely dead. Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death. For all organisms with a brain, death can instead be focused on this organ. The cause of death is usually considered important, and an autopsy can be done. There are many causes, from accidents to diseases.

Many cultures and religions have a concept of an afterlife that may hold the idea of judgment of good and bad deeds in one&#x27;s life. There are also different customs for honoring the body, such as a funeral, cremation, or sky burial. After a death, an obituary may be posted in a newspaper, and the &quot;survived by&quot; kin and friends usually go through the grieving process.

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
 There are many scientific approaches and various interpretations of the concept. Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.

==== Defining life to define death ====
One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. As a point in time, death seems to refer to the moment when life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination, therefore, requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult due to there being little consensus on how to define life.
It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, an organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms that are alive but probably not conscious. Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. Additionally, many religious traditions, including Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness. In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of organismic functioning and human death, which refers to irreversible loss of personhood. More specifically, death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning. As it pertains to human life, death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person.

==== Definition of death by heartbeat and breath ====
Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human&#x27;s death have been subjective or imprecise. Death was defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (CDD). Proponents of the CDD believe this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead. Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is irreversible because if CPR is applied fast enough, the person could be revived. Thus, the arguments for and against the CDD boil down to defining the actual words &quot;permanent&quot; and &quot;irreversible,&quot; which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants, and artificial pacemakers.

==== Brain death ====

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to &quot;brain death&quot; or &quot;biological death&quot; to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent and not transient, as occurs during certain sleep stages, and especially a coma. In the case of sleep, electroencephalograms (EEGs) are used to tell the difference.

The category of &quot;brain death&quot; is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, a senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: &quot;By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant &quot;brain-dead&quot; women).&quot;

While &quot;brain death&quot; is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible. Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that &quot;brain death&quot; cannot be equated with one in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.

EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity temporarily; because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

==== Neocortical brain death ====
People maintaining that only the neo-cortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually, the criterion for death may be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex. All hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone, given current and foreseeable medical technology. Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated.

==== Total brain death ====
At present, in most places, the more conservative definition of death (irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex) has been adopted. One example is the Uniform Determination Of Death Act in the United States. In the past, the adoption of this whole-brain definition was a conclusion of the President&#x27;s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1980. They concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. A multitude of reasons was presented to support this definition, including uniformity of standards in law for establishing death, consumption of a family&#x27;s fiscal resources for artificial life support, and legal establishment for equating brain death with death to proceed with organ donation.

==== Problems in medical practice ====
Aside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition: the variability of its application in medical practice. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) established the criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. At that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied to determine &quot;irreversible cessation&quot; of the total brain, including coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes. These criteria were updated again, most recently in 2010, but substantial discrepancies remain across hospitals and medical specialties.

==== Donations ====
The problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the dead donor rule, which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule: there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement, or that organ procurement cannot result in the death of the donor. A great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. Advocates of the rule believe that the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering any moral or legal objection to organ procurement. Critics, on the other hand, believe that the rule does not uphold the best interests of the donors and that the rule does not effectively promote organ donation.

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a warm-blooded animal is no longer alive are:
* Respiratory arrest (no breathing)
* Cardiac arrest (no pulse)
* Brain death (no neuronal activity)

The stages that follow after death are:
* , paleness which happens in 15–120 minutes after death
* , the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* , the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin &quot;rigor&quot;) and difficult to move or manipulate
* , a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* Putrefaction, the beginning signs of decomposition
* Decomposition, the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.
* Skeletonization, the end of decomposition, where all soft tissues have decomposed, leaving only the skeleton.
* Fossilization, the natural preservation of the skeletal remains formed over a very long period
===Legal===
The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between jurisdictions. Most countries follow the whole-brain death criteria, where all functions of the brain must have completely ceased. However, in other jurisdictions, some follow the brainstem version of brain death. Afterward, a death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor or by an administrative office, upon presentation of a doctor&#x27;s declaration of death.

===Misdiagnosis===

There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then &quot;coming back to life,&quot; sometimes days later in their coffin or when embalming procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public&#x27;s fear of being mistakenly buried alive and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse&#x27;s mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although some estimates peg the figure to be closer to 800.

In cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. This &quot;diving response,&quot; in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal, is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be reevaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death has been suggested as a better means of defining when true death occurs, though the concept has few practical applications outside the field of cryonics.

== Causes ==
The leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease. The leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging, leading to various complications known as aging-associated diseases. These conditions cause loss of homeostasis, leading to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%. With improved medical capability, dying has become a condition to be managed.

In developing nations, inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern medical technology make death from infectious diseases more common than in developed countries. One such disease is tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that killed 1.8 million people in 2015. In 2004, malaria caused about 2.7 million deaths annually. The AIDS death toll in Africa may reach 90–100 million by 2025.

According to Jean Ziegler, the United Nations Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008, mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006. Ziegler says worldwide, approximately 62 million people died from all causes and of those deaths, more than 36 million died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients.

Tobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people worldwide in the 21st century, a World Health Organization report warned.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. The evolutionary cause of aging is, at best, only beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.

Selye proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that stress decreases the adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe adaptability as a special resource, &quot;adaptation energy&quot;. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted. Selye assumed that adaptability is a finite supply presented at birth. Later, Goldstone proposed the concept of production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit) as a capital reserve of adaptation. In recent works, adaptation energy is considered an internal coordinate on the &quot;dominant path&quot; in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.

In 2012, suicide overtook car crashes as the leading cause of human injury deaths in the U.S., followed by poisoning, falls, and murder.

Accidents and disasters, from nuclear disasters to structural collapses, also claim lives. One of the deadliest incidents of all time is the 1975 Banqiao Dam Failure, with varying estimates, up to 240,000 dead. Other incidents with high death tolls are the Wanggongchang explosion (when a gunpowder factory ended up with 20,000 deaths), a collapse of a wall of Circus Maximus that killed 13,000 people, and the Chernobyl disaster that killed between 95 and 4,000 people.

Natural disasters kill around 45,000 people annually, although this number can vary from thousands to millions on a per-decade basis. Some of the deadliest natural disasters are the 1931 China floods, which killed an estimated 4 million people, although estimates widely vary; the 1887 Yellow River flood, which killed an estimated 2 million people in China; and the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed as many as 500,000 people in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). If naturally occurring famines are considered natural disasters, the Chinese famine of 1906–1907, which killed 15–20 million people, can be considered the deadliest natural disaster in recorded history.

In animals, predation can be a common cause of death. Livestock have a 6% death rate from predation. However, younger animals are more susceptible to predation. For example, 50% of young foxes die to birds, bobcats, coyotes, and other foxes as well. Young bear cubs in the Yellowstone National Park only have a 40% chance to survive to adulthood from other bears and predators.

=== Autopsy ===

An autopsy, also known as a &quot;postmortem examination&quot; or an &quot;obduction&quot;, is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person&#x27;s death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together.

A necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination. In modern times, this term is more commonly associated with the corpses of animals.

== Death before birth ==
Death before birth can happen in several ways: stillbirth, when the fetus dies before or during the delivery process; miscarriage, when the embryo dies before independent survival; and abortion, the artificial termination of the pregnancy. Stillbirth and miscarriage can happen for various reasons, while abortion is carried out purposely.

=== Stillbirth ===

Stillbirth can happen right before or after the delivery of a fetus. It can result from defects of the fetus or risk factors present in the mother. Reductions of these factors, caesarean sections when risks are present, and early detection of birth defects have lowered the rate of stillbirth. However, 1% of births in the United States end in a stillbirth.

=== Miscarriage ===

A miscarriage is defined by the World Health Organization as, &quot;The expulsion or extraction from its mother of an embryo or fetus weighing 500g or less.&quot; Miscarriage is one of the most frequent problems in pregnancy, and is reported in around 12–15% of all clinical pregnancies; however, by including pregnancy losses during menstruation, it could be up to 17–22% of all pregnancies. There are many risk-factors involved in miscarriage; consumption of caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, having a previous miscarriage, and the use of abortion can increase the chances of having a miscarriage.

=== Abortion ===

An abortion may be performed for many reasons, such as pregnancy from rape, financial constraints of having a child, teenage pregnancy, and the lack of support from a significant other. There are two forms of abortion: a medical abortion and an in-clinic abortion or sometimes referred to as a surgical abortion. A medical abortion involves taking a pill that will terminate the pregnancy no more than 11 weeks past the last period, and an in-clinic abortion involves a medical procedure using suction to empty the uterus; this is possible after 12 weeks, but it may be more difficult to find an operating doctor who will go through with the procedure.

== Senescence ==

Senescence refers to a scenario when a living being can survive all calamities but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Conversely, premature death can refer to a death that occurs before old age arrives, for example, human death before a person reaches the age of 75. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from the deterioration of cellular activity and the ruination of regular functioning. The aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur daily relates to senescence, while around the world, it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily.

Almost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging, known in life sciences as &quot;senescence.&quot; Some organisms experience negligible senescence, even exhibiting biological immortality. These include the jellyfish &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, the hydra, and the planarian. Unnatural causes of death include suicide and predation. Of all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two-thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90% (i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence).

Physiological death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible. Where in the process, a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs. In general, clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death. A patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring.

== Life extension ==

Life extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan, especially in humans, by slowing or reversing aging processes through anti-aging measures. Aging is the most common cause of death worldwide. Aging is seen as inevitable, so according to Aubrey de Grey little is spent on research into anti-aging therapies, a phenomenon known as pro-aging trance.

The average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as cancer or cardiovascular disease. Extension of lifespan can be achieved by good diet, exercise, and avoidance of hazards such as smoking. Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes. A recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is calorie restriction. Theoretically, the extension of the maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, molecular repair, or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found religious and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes, have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people. 38% said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension can be known as &quot;biomedical gerontologists.&quot; They try to understand aging, and develop treatments to reverse aging processes, or at least slow them for the improvement of health and maintenance of youthfulness. Those who use life extension findings and apply them to themselves are called &quot;life extensionists&quot; or &quot;longevists.&quot; The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply anti-aging methods to attempt to live long enough to benefit from a cure for aging.

=== Cryonics ===

Cryonics (from Greek κρύος &#x27;kryos-&#x27; meaning &#x27;icy cold&#x27;) is the low-temperature preservation of animals, including humans, who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and may be possible in the future.

Cryopreservation of people and other large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions, may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent &#x27;information-theoretic&#x27; definition of death.

Some scientific literature is claimed to support the feasibility of cryonics. Medical science and cryobiologists generally regard cryonics with skepticism.

== Location ==
Around 1930, most people in Western countries died in their own homes, surrounded by family, and comforted by clergy, neighbors, and doctors making house calls. By the mid-20th century, half of all Americans died in a hospital. By the start of the 21st century, only about 20 to 25% of people in developed countries died outside of a medical institution. The shift from dying at home towards dying in a professional medical environment has been termed the &quot;Invisible Death.&quot; This shift occurred gradually over the years until most deaths now occur outside the home.

== Psychology ==
Death studies is a field within psychology. To varying degrees people inherently fear death, both the process and the eventuality; it is hard wired and part of the &#x27;survival instinct&#x27; of all animals. Discussing, thinking about, or planning for their deaths causes them discomfort. This fear may cause them to put off financial planning, preparing a will and testament, or requesting help from a hospice organization.

Mortality salience is the awareness that death is inevitable. However, self-esteem and culture are ways to reduce the anxiety this effect can cause. The awareness of someone&#x27;s own death can cause a deepened bond in their in-group as a defense mechanism. This can also cause the person to become very judging. In a study, two groups were formed; one group was asked to reflect upon their mortality, the other was not, afterwards, the groups were told to set a bond for a prostitute. The group that did not reflect on death had an average of $50, the group who was reminded about their death had an average of $455.

Different people have different responses to the idea of their deaths. Philosopher Galen Strawson writes that the death that many people wish for is an instant, painless, unexperienced annihilation. In this unlikely scenario, the person dies without realizing it and without being able to fear it. One moment the person is walking, eating, or sleeping, and the next moment, the person is dead. Strawson reasons that this type of death would not take anything away from the person, as he believes a person cannot have a legitimate claim to ownership in the future.

== Society and culture ==


In society, the nature of death and humanity&#x27;s awareness of its mortality has, for millennia, been a concern of the world&#x27;s religious traditions and philosophical inquiry. Including belief in resurrection or an afterlife (associated with Abrahamic religions), reincarnation or rebirth (associated with Dharmic religions), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as eternal oblivion (associated with secular humanism).

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning, funeral practices, and ceremonies of honoring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a &quot;corpse&quot; or &quot;body&quot;, are usually interred whole or cremated, though among the world&#x27;s cultures, there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include &quot;rest in peace&quot; (originally the Latin, &quot;requiescat in pace&quot;) or its initialism RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The disposal of human corpses does, in general, begin with the last offices before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or cremation. This is not a unified practice; in Tibet, for instance, the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one&#x27;s spiritual attainments into another body (reincarnation) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet. Mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures to retard the rate of decay. The rise of secularism resulted in material mementos of death declining.

Some parts of death in culture are legally based, having laws for when death occurs, such as the receiving of a death certificate, the settlement of the deceased estate, and the issues of inheritance and, in some countries, inheritance taxation.

Capital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as adultery and sodomy, carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes, such as apostasy, the formal renunciation of one&#x27;s religion. In many retentionist countries, drug trafficking is also a capital offense. In China, human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world, courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny. Mutiny is punishable by death in the United States.

Death in warfare and suicide attacks also have cultural links, and the ideas of &quot;dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,&quot; which translates to &quot;It is sweet and proper to die for one&#x27;s country&quot;, is a concept that dates to antiquity. Additionally, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the Western world—with the increase in terrorism following the September 11 attacks but also further back in time with suicide bombings, kamikaze missions in World War II, and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history—death for a cause by way of suicide attack, including martyrdom, have had significant cultural impacts.

Suicide, in general, and particularly euthanasia, are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In Japan, for example, ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin.

Death is personified in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the Grim Reaper, Azrael, the Hindu god Yama, and Father Time. In the west, the Grim Reaper, or figures similar to it, is the most popular depiction of death in western cultures.

In Brazil, death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry. Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório. Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs, and fees of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, and cultural burial, which, in turn, raises the debate about inaccurate mortality rates.

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue in most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open-air burning-to-ashes.

=== Origins of death ===
The origin of death is a theme or myth of how death came to be. It is present in nearly all cultures across the world, as death is a universal happening. This makes it an origin myth, a myth that describes how a feature of the natural or social world appeared. There can be some similarities between myths and cultures. In North American mythology, the theme of a man who wants to be immortal and a man who wants to die can be seen across many Indigenous people. In Christianity, death is the result of the fall of man after eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In Greek mythology, the opening of Pandora&#x27;s box releases death upon the world.

== Consciousness ==
Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one&#x27;s consciousness as one&#x27;s body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called &quot;eternal oblivion&quot;. The belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term &quot;afterlife&quot;.

Near-death experiences (NDEs) describe the subjective experiences associated with impending death. Some survivors of such experiences report it as &quot;seeing the afterlife while they were dying&quot;. Seeing a being of light and talking with it, life flashing before the eyes, and the confirmation of cultural beliefs of the afterlife are common themes in NDEs.

== In biology ==
After death, the remains of a former organism become part of the biogeochemical cycle, during which animals may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger. Organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms that recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain, where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of an organism. Examples of detritivores include earthworms, woodlice, and millipedes.

Microorganisms also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be fully decomposed. Coal, a fossil fuel formed over vast tracts of time in swamp ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
The contemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection. It is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die, having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to extinction and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as speciation. Frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to Darwinian criteria, much greater fitness than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

Death also has a role in competition, where if a species out-competes another, there is a risk of death for the population, especially in the case where they are directly fighting over resources.

=== Extinction ===

Death plays a role in extinction, the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa, reducing biodiversity, due to extinction being generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point). Because a species&#x27; potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age. However, there are exceptions, such as &quot;Hydra&quot; and the jellyfish &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, which research shows to be biologically immortal.

Organisms showing only asexual reproduction, such as bacteria, some protists, like the euglenoids and many amoebozoans, and unicellular organisms with sexual reproduction, colonial or not, like the volvocine algae &quot;Pandorina&quot; and &quot;Chlamydomonas,&quot; are &quot;immortal&quot; at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In multicellular organisms and also in multinucleate ciliates with a Weismannist development, that is, with a division of labor between mortal somatic (body) cells and &quot;immortal&quot; germ (reproductive) cells, death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.

The &quot;Volvox&quot; algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence, include the death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its life history.

=== Grief in animals ===
Animals have sometimes shown grief for their partners or &quot;friends.&quot; When two chimpanzees form a bond together, sexual or not, and one of them dies, the surviving chimpanzee will show signs of grief, ripping out their hair in anger and starting to cry; if the body is removed, they will resist, they will eventually go quiet when the body is gone, but upon seeing the body again, the chimp will return to a violent state.

Furthermore, anthropologist Barbara J. King has suggested that one way to evaluate the expression of grief in animals is to look for altered behaviors such as social withdrawal, disrupted eating or sleeping, expression of affect, or increased stress reactions in response to the death of a family member, mate, or friend. These criteria do not assume the ability to anticipate death, understand its finality, or experience emotions equivalent to those of humans, but at the same time do not rule out the possibility of those abilities existing in some animals or that different kinds of emotional experiences might constitute grief. Based on these criteria, King gives examples of observed potential mourning behaviors in animals such as cetaceans, apes and monkeys, elephants, domesticated animals (including dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, and farmed animals), giraffes, peccaries, donkeys, prairie voles, and some species of birds.

=== Death of abiotic factors ===
Some non-living things can be considered dead. For example, a volcano, batteries, electrical components, and stars are all nonliving things that can &quot;die,&quot; whether from destruction or cessation of function.

A volcano, a break in the earth&#x27;s crust that allows lava, ash, and gases to escape, has three states that it may be in, active, dormant, and extinct. An active volcano has recently or is currently erupting; in a dormant volcano, it has not erupted for a significant amount of time, but it may erupt again; in an extinct volcano, it may be cut off from the supply of its lava and will never be expected to erupt again, so the volcano can be considered to be dead.

A battery can be considered dead after the charge is fully used up. Electrical components are similar in this fashion, in the case that it may not be able to be used again, such as after a spill of water on the components, the component can be considered dead.

Stars also have a life-span and, therefore, can die. After it starts to run out of fuel, it starts to expand, this can be analogous to the star aging. After it exhausts all fuel, it may explode in a supernova, collapse into a black hole, or turn into a neutron star.

== Religious views ==
=== Buddhism ===
In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death motivated Prince Siddhartha to strive to find the &quot;deathless&quot; and finally attain enlightenment. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being. Rebirth as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. Therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering, and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination.

=== Christianity ===

While there are different sects of Christianity with different branches of belief, the overarching ideology on death grows from the knowledge of the afterlife. After death, the individual will undergo a separation from mortality to immortality; their soul leaves the body, entering a realm of spirits. Following this separation of body and spirit (death), resurrection will occur. Representing the same transformation Jesus Christ embodied after his body was placed in the tomb for three days, each person&#x27;s body will be resurrected, reuniting the spirit and body in a perfect form. This process allows the individual&#x27;s soul to withstand death and transform into life after death.

===Hinduism===


In Hindu texts, death is described as the individual eternal spiritual &quot;jiva-atma&quot; (soul or conscious self) exiting the current temporary material body. The soul exits this body when the body can no longer sustain the conscious self (life), which may be due to mental or physical reasons or, more accurately, the inability to act on one&#x27;s &quot;kama&quot; (material desires). During conception, the soul enters a compatible new body based on the remaining merits and demerits of one&#x27;s &quot;karma&quot; (good/bad material activities based on &quot;dharma&quot;) and the state of one&#x27;s mind (impressions or last thoughts) at the time of death.

Usually, the process of reincarnation makes one forget all memories of one&#x27;s previous life. Because nothing really dies and the temporary material body is always changing, both in this life and the next, death means forgetfulness of one&#x27;s previous experiences.

===Islam===
The Islamic view is that death is the separation of the soul from the body as well as the beginning of the afterlife. The afterlife, or &quot;akhirah,&quot; is one of the six main beliefs in Islam. Rather than seeing death as the end of life, Muslims consider death as a continuation of life in another form. In Islam, life on earth right now is a short, temporary life and a testing period for every soul. True life begins with the Day of Judgement when all people will be divided into two groups. The righteous believers will be welcomed to &quot;janna&quot; (heaven), and the disbelievers and evildoers will be punished in &quot;jahannam&quot; (hellfire).

Muslims believe death to be wholly natural and predetermined by God. Only God knows the exact time of a person&#x27;s death. The Quran emphasizes that death is inevitable, no matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone. (Q50:16) Life on earth is the one and only chance for people to prepare themselves for the life to come and choose to either believe or not believe in God, and death is the end of that learning opportunity.

=== Judaism ===
There are a variety of beliefs about the afterlife within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference for life over death. This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any commandments.

== Language ==
The word &quot;death&quot; comes from Old English &quot;dēaþ&quot;, which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *&quot;dauþuz&quot; (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *&quot;dheu-&quot; meaning the &quot;process, act, condition of dying.&quot;

The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms. When a person has died, it is also said they have &quot;passed away&quot;, &quot;passed on&quot;, &quot;expired&quot;, or &quot;gone&quot;, among other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms.

As a formal reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the participle form of &quot;decease&quot;, as in &quot;the deceased&quot;; another noun form is &quot;&quot;.

Bereft of life, the dead person is a &quot;corpse&quot;, &quot;cadaver&quot;, &quot;body&quot;, &quot;set of remains&quot;, or when all flesh is gone, a &quot;skeleton&quot;. The terms &quot;carrion&quot; and &quot;carcass&quot; are also used, usually for dead non-human animals. The ashes left after a cremation are lately called &quot;cremains&quot;.

<text>The Deseret alphabet (; Deseret: or ) is a phonemic English-language spelling reform developed between 1847 and 1854 by the board of regents of the University of Deseret under the leadership of Brigham Young, the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). George D. Watt is reported to have been the most actively involved in the development of the script&#x27;s novel characters, which were used to replace those of Isaac Pitman&#x27;s English phonotypic alphabet. He was also the &quot;New Alphabet&#x27;s&quot; first serious user. The script gets its name from the word &quot;deseret&quot;, a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; in the Book of Mormon, which is said to mean &quot;honeybee&quot; in the only verse it is used in.

The Deseret alphabet was an outgrowth of the Restorationist idealism and utopianism of Young and the early LDS Church. Young and the Mormon pioneers believed &quot;all aspects of life&quot; were in need of reform for the imminent millennium, and the Deseret alphabet was just one of many ways in which they sought to bring about a complete &quot;transformation in society,&quot; in anticipation of the Second Coming of Jesus. Young wrote of the reform that &quot;it would represent every sound used in the construction of any known language; and, in fact, a step and partial return to a pure language which has been promised unto us in the latter days&quot;, which meant the pure Adamic language spoken before the Tower of Babel.

In public statements, Young claimed the alphabet would replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet for the English language. This would offer immigrants an opportunity to learn to read and write English, the orthography of which, he said, is often less phonetically consistent than those of many other languages. Young also proposed teaching the alphabet in the school system, stating &quot;It will be the means of introducing uniformity in our orthography, and the years that are now required to learn to read and spell can be devoted to other studies.&quot;

Between 1854 and 1869, the alphabet was used in scriptural newspaper passages, selected church records, a few diaries, and some correspondence. Occasional street signs and posters used the new letters. In 1860 a $5 gold coin was embossed 𐐐𐐬𐑊𐐨𐑌𐐮𐑅 𐐻𐐭 𐑄 𐐢𐐫𐑉𐐼 (Holiness to the Lord). In 1868–9, after much difficulty creating suitable fonts, four books were printed: two school primers, the full Book of Mormon, and a first portion of it, intended as a third school reader.

Despite repeated and costly promotion by the early LDS Church, the alphabet never enjoyed widespread use, and it has been regarded by historians as a failure. However, in recent years, aided by digital typography, the Deseret alphabet has been revived as a cultural heirloom.

Similar neographies have been attempted, the most well-known of which for English is the Shavian alphabet.

== History ==

=== Creation (1847–1854) ===
The Deseret alphabet was a project of the Mormon pioneers, a group of early followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who, motivated by revelations of a unique premillennial eschatology, had set about building a unique theocracy in the Utah desert, which was then still claimed by Mexico, after the death of the church&#x27;s founder, the prophet Joseph Smith. They were to build a &quot;city of Zion&quot; where converts would gather in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ. As part of that Gathering, in 1848, Church leaders urged converts in Europe to &quot;emigrate as speedily as possible&quot; to the Great Basin. There, in the &quot;Kingdom of God,&quot; under fused theo-democratic leadership, they would be safe from the fall of the apostate world of so-called &quot;Babylon.&quot;

March 6, 1849, Church authorities organized the &quot;free and independent government&quot; called the State of Deseret, while retaining the Council of Fifty. In that historical context, which has been called &quot;The Forgotten Kingdom,&quot; there was a &quot;compete identity of religious and temporal purpose throughout the history of the Alphabet.&quot; This theo-linguistic fusion has been noted by multiple historians.

The &quot;New Alphabet&quot; was intended to correct &quot;the corruptions and perversions of language which was originally pure&quot;, and to meet the urgent need for a language to &quot;answer the demands of a constant intercommunication between several thousand languages&quot;. One &quot;fitted to meet the great emergency of the great gathering and great work of teaching the law of the Lord to all people.&quot; This reformation of English orthography was a first step to the ultimate restoration of Adamic language for use in the anticipated millennial dispensation of the fulness of times.

The Deseret Typographical Association called the alphabet &quot;a forerunner in that series of developments which shall prepare mankind for the reception of pure language&quot;. Brigham Young, Church President and Prophet, the &quot;driving force&quot; for the reform, looked forward to the time &quot;when a man is full of light of eternity&quot;, and stated, &quot;I shall yet see the time that I can converse with this people without opening my mouth.&quot;

The Deseret alphabet was developed primarily by a committee made up of the board of regents of the University of Deseret, members of which included LDS Church leaders Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, and several of the other Apostles. According to Brigham Young University professor Richard G. Moore, most scholars believe that George D. Watt&#x27;s contribution to the actual form the alphabet took, its unique glyphs, was the greatest; he furthermore &quot;plant[ed] the idea of spelling reform in Brigham Young&#x27;s mind&quot; through a phonography class he gave after the death of Joseph Smith which Young attended. William W. Phelps helped &quot;work out the letters&quot; along with Pratt. Before they decided on the Deseret alphabet, the attention of the board of regents was mostly focused on Pitman style alphabets, and in April 1847 Brigham Young nearly purchased of lead type to print books using Pitman&#x27;s orthography. The University of Deseret was incorporated on 28 February 1850; less than three weeks later, on 20 March, the new board of regents began to discuss spelling reform.

On 29 November 1853, the committee was ready to approve a slightly modified version of the Pitman orthography, when Apostle Willard Richards, Second Counselor to Young, who had been deathly ill and missed the debate before the vote, saw the proposed alphabet, which spelled the word &quot;phonetic&quot; as &quot;fɷnetic&quot;. Richards was quick to condemn it, saying to the committee: &quot;We want a new kind of alphabet...those characters...seem like putting new wine into old bottles...I am inclined to think...we shall...throw away all characters that bear much resemblance to the English characters, and introduce an alphabet that is original...an alphabet entirely different from any alphabet in use.&quot;

These words persuaded Brigham Young and the rest of the committee, and Watt then endeavored to create an original alphabet. Less than two months later, on 19 January 1854, the board of regents finally approved the first 38-letter Deseret alphabet. One legacy of Pitman&#x27;s orthography survived, though: the idea that one letter should equal one sound.

=== Use by the Mormon pioneers (1854–1869) ===
Upon the alphabet&#x27;s acceptance, its first user was its principal architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting minutes of the early Bishops in a cursive form of it in 1854. Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as Thales Hastings Haskell, began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet. Remy further reported that during his time in Salt Lake City, he saw signs on the street and above shops using the new alphabet.

After its approval by the board of regents, Brigham Young testified before the Utah territorial legislature that the new alphabet should &quot;be thoroughly and extensively taught in all the schools&quot;. Some teaching in Utah schools did take place: John B. Milner taught the alphabet in Provo, Lehi, American Fork, and Pleasant Grove, while evening classes were taught in Salt Lake City and Farmington.

After several months&#x27; practice writing with the new alphabet, Watt wrote to Brigham Young that he was unhappy with it, and proposed a complete overhaul, which was never followed up on.

Word of the new alphabet soon spread outside Utah, and most press reports in non-Mormon papers were critical. Other writers, however, acquainted with other phonotypic and stenographic alphabets, ranged from neutral descriptions of the new alphabet to praise.

Until this point, all the printed material (mostly just charts of the alphabet and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 the board of regents appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew &amp; Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew &amp; Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.

In 1859, with the new type in hand, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; began printing with it. It would print one piece per issue in the new alphabet, usually a quotation from &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; or the New Testament. However, this only lasted for one year, after which the practice stopped; it would start again in May 1864 and stop permanently at the end of that year.Benn Pitman, the brother of Isaac Pitman, was also interested in spelling reform, and by 1864 had published his own orthography, which the board of regents considered adopting. However, they ultimately decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.

Brigham Young blamed the failure of this first attempt at reform on the ugliness of the type developed by Ladew &amp; Peer, and so he commissioned Russell&#x27;s American Steam Printing House, a New York City based font foundry, to design more pleasing type. The result was the Bodoni-esque font (below) that was used to print all of the books in this period. In an 1868 article, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; wrote that &quot;the characters, to a person unaccustomed to them, may look strange, [but] to the eye to which they are familiar they are beautiful.&quot;

At least four books were published in the new alphabet, all transcribed by Orson Pratt and all using the Russell&#x27;s House font: &quot;The First Deseret Alphabet Reader&quot; (1868), &quot;The Second Deseret Alphabet Reader&quot; (1868), &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; (1869), and a &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; excerpt called &quot;First Nephi–Omni&quot; (1869).

Considerable non-printed material in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in Cedar City, Utah, some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the more curious items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-Hopi dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. The handwritten document sat in the LDS Church Archives, largely ignored until 2014 when writing system researcher and computer scientist Kenneth R. Beesley re-discovered it and transcribed it into standard written English.

=== Decline (1869–1877) ===

Despite years of heavy promotion, the Deseret alphabet was never widely adopted. This reluctance was partly due to prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort and most of the rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Orson Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would be over $5,000,000.

According to Beesley, many have written that interest in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, is not true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young&#x27;s time. Only 500 copies of the full &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for $2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive and even the most devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the &quot;Deseret News&quot;.

Contemporary writers noted that thousands of copies of the 15¢ and 20¢ Deseret primers went unsold, and historian Roby Wentz speculated that the LDS Church at that time had a &quot;cache&quot; of the primers in mint condition, which it was slowly selling off; according to him, one such primer sold for $250 in 1978.

The Mormons had planned to use the profits from sale of the earlier books to fund printing of more books, and in anticipation Orson Pratt had already transcribed the complete Bible, &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot;, and John Jaques&#x27;s &quot;Catechism for Children&quot;. Pratt had also prepared an apparent sequel to the primers, the &quot;Deseret Phonetic Speller&quot;. After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a storage area of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967.

Ralph Vigoda, a reporter for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, has speculated that the completion of the Transcontinental railroad may have contributed to the alphabet&#x27;s downfall: non-Mormons, not loyal to Brigham Young, became a large part of the city, and without the religious motivation it would be difficult indeed to get them to learn a new alphabet. In a retrospective piece, historian A. J. Simmonds claims that the new railroad doomed the alphabet. According to him, easy access to &quot;the whole literature of the English speaking world&quot; rendered the alphabet useless.

In July 1877, Young tried one more time at a spelling reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac&#x27;s brother) with the intention of printing an edition of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; and &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young&#x27;s death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young&#x27;s death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English spelling reforms.

=== Rediscovery in the computer era ===
Modern digital typography has reduced the costs of typesetting substantially, especially for small print runs. Freely licensed Deseret alphabet fonts can be used at no additional cost.

Film director Trent Harris used the Deseret alphabet in his 1994 satire of Mormon theology, &quot;Plan 10 from Outer Space&quot;, where it features as an alien language used on a mysterious &quot;Plaque of Kolob&quot;.

During the 1996 Utah Centennial celebration, an activity book for children was distributed, within which one of the activities was for a child to write their own name in the alphabet. The book says that a child who does this will be &quot;the first kid in 100 years to write [their] name in the Deseret alphabet!&quot;

Also in 1996, &quot;Buffalo River Press&quot; published a reprint of the &quot;Deseret First Book&quot;, of which only 10,000 were originally printed. The entire &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; in the Deseret alphabet has been likewise reprinted, as only 500 copies from the original print run exist, and they can sell on eBay for ≈$7,500 (as of 2004). In 1997, John Jenkins uploaded a free three part PDF of the so-called &quot;triple combination&quot;, that is, a combined &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; and &quot;Pearl of Great Price&quot;.

John Jenkins has gone on to publish many classic pieces of English literature in the Deseret alphabet, such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.&quot;

Owing to the character set&#x27;s inclusion in Unicode, most of the original books and many of the original manuscripts have been transcribed into plain text, and, when this is not possible due to discrepancies between the Unicode reference glyphs and the documents, LaTeX.

==== Fonts ====
 The first digital font for the Deseret alphabet, called &quot;Deseret&quot;, was designed by Greg Kearney as part of work he was doing for the LDS Church History Department in 1991; the font was used in an exhibit that year. In August 1995, a cleaned up, digitized version of the font in use in the &quot;Deseret Second Book&quot; was created by Salt Lake City graphic designer Edward Bateman, who made the font in Fontographer while working on &quot;Plan 10 from Outer Space&quot;.

Kenneth R. Beesley created a Metafont (and thus, LaTeX-compatible) font called in 2002.

All computers running Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 7 operating system or newer can display the entire Deseret alphabet Unicode range as the glyphs are included in the Segoe UI Symbol font.

Besides maintaining a Deseret input method for Windows, Joshua Erickson, a UCLA alumnus, also maintains a large collection of freeware Unicode fonts for the alphabet, which he collectively terms the &quot;Bee Fonts.&quot;

There also exist free software fonts for the Deseret alphabet. Google, through its Noto Sans project, the aim of which is &quot;to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel&quot;, has also released a Deseret font under the name &quot;Noto Sans Deseret&quot;. George Douros maintains a public domain font called &quot;Analecta&quot; as part of his Unicode Fonts for Ancient Scripts project, which supports the Coptic, Gothic, and Deseret scripts. Deseret glyphs are also available in the popular pan-Unicode fonts Code2001 and Everson Mono (as of version 5.1.5).

== Alphabet ==
Although the Deseret alphabet has letter case, usually the only difference between the minuscule and majuscule forms is that the majuscule forms are larger.

A degree of free spelling is allowed to accommodate dialectal differences in English. For example, in the Deseret edition of &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, the word &quot;wherefore&quot; is written as 𐐸𐐶𐐩𐑉𐑁𐐬𐑉 (), which means that the translator of the book did not exhibit the wine–whine merger. Those who do exhibit the merger might instead prefer the spelling 𐐶𐐯𐑉𐑁𐐬𐑉 to match the pronunciation (), or, depending on dialect, perhaps 𐐶𐐯𐑉𐑁𐐫𐑉 ().

The alphabet was designed to be able to write all of the vowels used in the dialect spoken in 19th century Utah. The vowel inventory has also been attributed to the fact that, unlike other American pioneers, the Mormon pioneers were from New England as opposed to the American South. As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since merged in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in some dialects of English, particularly dialects of US English, though are still present in others, such as many varieties of British English.

Speakers who exhibit the father–bother merger no longer distinguish (𐐪) and (𐐱), and so both &quot;father&quot; and &quot;bother&quot; would be written with 𐐪: as 𐑁𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉 and 𐐺𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉 as opposed to 𐑁𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉 and 𐐺𐐱𐑄𐐲𐑉. For those with the cot–caught merger, (𐐫) and (𐐱) are no longer distinguished: both &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; are thus written by them as 𐐿𐐱𐐻 () in the case of North American English, and as 𐐿𐐫𐐻 () in the case of Scottish English. For those exhibiting both mergers, both would be written 𐐿𐐪𐐻 ().

=== Versions ===
There have been several published versions of the alphabet. Most versions (including the versions used in &quot;The Deseret First Book&quot;, &quot;The Deseret Second Book&quot;, &quot;The Deseret News&quot; and &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;) had only 38 letters, but some versions contained two ligatures, 𐐧 (ew) and 𐐦 (oi). In place of 𐐮𐐭 or 𐐷𐐭, 𐑏 was to be used; in place of 𐐱𐐮, 𐑎.

In the 23 February 1859 edition of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, the editors announced their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for use would have been a considerable expense, so it was never realized.

=== Representation of ===
The Deseret alphabet does not have a distinct symbol for the mid central vowel ([], &quot;schwa&quot;). The lack of a schwa has been cited as the biggest &quot;phonological flaw&quot; in the alphabet.

Because of the lack of a schwa, the author must write the sound that would be used if the syllable was stressed. For example, the word &quot;enough&quot; is commonly pronounced , but when it is stressed (as in a declaration of irritation) it is pronounced . The Deseret spelling of the word, 𐐨𐑌𐐲𐑁, reflects that stressed pronunciation. If [] does not have an inherent stressed value in a word, as is often the case before , then it is written as 𐐲.

Marion Jackson Shelton, an early Mormon missionary, proposed the addition of a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the Turkish dotless i (ı). The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it. Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the Paiute people.

=== Syllabic values ===
Each letter in the Deseret alphabet has a name, and when a letter is written on its own it has the value of that name. This allows some short words to be written with a single letter, and is called a letter&#x27;s &quot;syllabic value&quot;. The most common word in English, &quot;the&quot;, is written simply 𐑄, as the letter&#x27;s name is and that is the stressed pronunciation of the word. The consonants with syllabic values are 𐐶 (woo), 𐐷 (yee), 𐐸 (ha), 𐐹 (pee), 𐐺 (be/bee), 𐐻 (tee/tea), 𐐽 (qi), 𐐾 (jee), 𐑀 (gay), and 𐑄 (the/thee).

Syllabic values do not apply within words, although this was formerly the case. In early documents, Watt writes &quot;people&quot; as 𐐹𐐹𐑊 with the expectation that readers will interpret the first 𐐹 as , but the second 𐐹 as . This contextual value switching was soon done away with, so in later documents, while &quot;bee&quot; is written 𐐺, &quot;bees&quot; is written 𐐺𐐨𐑆.

In 40-letter versions of the alphabet which include the letter 𐐧 (ew) which represents , the letter 𐐧 when standing alone can be used to represent the word &quot;you&quot;.

The first lesson in the &quot;Deseret First Book&quot; reads simply:

In the &quot;Deseret Second Book&quot;, there is a version of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; on page 19:

== Handwriting ==
There were two main handwritten forms of the Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as 𐑅, 𐑀 and 𐐼. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form was part of the plan from the very beginning.

=== Cursive ===

The cursive form of the Deseret alphabet was mainly used by two people: George D. Watt, and James Henry Martineau. Watt, a stenographer, recorded several bishops meetings and wrote other personal documents in this cursive style. A chart of the cursive form appears below. The blue glyphs represent how to write each character, while the top row of printed glyphs shows the corresponding Unicode reference glyph.

The cursive style has many unorthodox characteristics uncommon to alphabetic writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if the writer is in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and 𐐮 is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.

The table below shows some examples of how the cursive form is written. Dropped vowels are marked in parentheses.

=== Block letters ===
George D. Watt found his own alphabet cumbersome to write and abandoned it. As he wrote to Brigham Young on 21 August 1854:
His new alphabet closely resembled an 1853 publication of Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored with the original Deseret alphabet, and so he rejected the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet as part of his job despite his reservations.

After 1855, no more cursive documents appear, and all surviving journals are written in block letters. Marion J. Shelton, an early Mormon missionary who wrote a dictionary of the Hopi language in the alphabet, was a &quot;typical&quot; 40-letter Deseret writer, and his style of writing is shown below.

== Design criticism ==

The Deseret alphabet was purposely designed so as to not have ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet in an era of metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.

While well intentioned, this lack has been described as a &quot;catastrophic&quot; mistake that makes type look &quot;monotonous&quot; and makes all words look alike. Some have joked that this aesthetic quality could cause the new alphabet to be mistaken from afar for a Turkish tax list.

The Mormon pioneers were apparently aware of the problems caused by its monotony:

Other criticism of the design was harsher still. In an 18 December 1857 editorial in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the alphabet was described as being &quot;so arranged and named as to cause the greatest possible annoyance to outsiders&quot; and the design of the letters as &quot;incomprehensible as [...] the hieroglyphics of the [...] Egyptians.&quot; On 4 March 1872, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the alphabet &quot;rude, awkward and cumbersome&quot;.

Some modern computer fonts and printed books have attempted to correct this perceived fault: in the books in John Jenkins&#x27; &quot;Deseret Alphabet Classics&quot; series, the font used adds a descender to 𐑉 and 𐐻 and an ascender to 𐐼 and 𐑇 among other tweaks.

== Other motives ==
Officially, the Deseret alphabet was created to simplify the spelling of English words for the benefit of children and English as a second language learners. Some of the alphabet&#x27;s contemporaries, however, posited an alternative motivation for its development: increasing the isolation of the early Mormons.

=== To keep outsiders from reading Mormon secrets (largely dismissed) ===
The charge that the Deseret alphabet&#x27;s main purpose was to keep outsiders (&quot;gentiles&quot; in LDS terminology) in the dark was brought almost immediately, as evidenced by the following 1858 &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot; reprint of an unnamed &quot;New York newspaper&quot;:
Having obtained a copy of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; in 1859, the &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot; disparaged it on April 25, writing &quot;The &quot;Deseret News&quot; is filled with a lot of hieroglyphs. It seems to be [an alphabet] which the Mormons alone are to be taught.&quot;

Modern historians, however, doubt the veracity of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and every book published in the alphabet prominently features the key to the alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of &quot;A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City&quot;, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.

=== To keep Mormons from reading outside literature ===
With the impending completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, the Mormon pioneers would have easy, cheap access to publications from the east, including yellowbacks, penny dreadfuls, pulp magazines, and other often scandalous or dirty publications that were rising to prominence in the 19th century. Indeed, in an article about the benefits of the alphabet, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; proudly wrote:
In another article, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; cited an example of the kind of literature Mormons would benefit from not being able to read: &quot;The Police Gazette&quot;. Historians A. J. Simmonds and Roby Wentz contend that while this may have been a tertiary goal of the alphabet, a sort of &quot;happy accident&quot;, the main purpose of it was simple orthographic reform. Simmonds notes that the teaching of English to foreigners was not a mere hypothetical to mask isolationist tendencies: 35% of the Utah Territory&#x27;s population at the time was Scandinavian, with German, Italian and Welsh speaking people also making up a considerable percentage of inhabitants; therefore, communication between the recently baptized and the community was a real problem.

== Encodings ==

The Deseret alphabet (U+10400–U+1044F) was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2001 with the release of version 3.1, after a request by John H. Jenkins of Apple, making it one of the first scripts to be added outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane. The letters 𐐧 (ew) and 𐐦 (oi) were added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0.

According to Kenneth R. Beesley, who submitted the proposal to expand the encoding, &quot;Unicode fonts based on the current heterogeneous collection of glyphs will be useless for any practical typesetting of 40-letter Deseret Alphabet documents.&quot; This is because the Unicode Consortium chose to use glyphs from 1855 as the reference glyphs, while by 1859 those glyphs were already outmoded and replaced with newer glyphs. Beesley thus recommends using LaTeX along with his Metafont font to typeset Deseret text, but fonts which use the alternate glyphs for the two codepoints in question would also work for transcription of 40-letter Deseret texts written during and after 1859.
On 25 February 2016, the Library of Congress approved an ALA-LC romanization for the Deseret alphabet. The table can be used to display approximations of titles in non-Latin scripts using the Latin alphabet for use in library catalogs that do not support non-Latin alphabets.

<text>Danish (, ; , ) is a North Germanic language from the Indo-European language family spoken by about six million people, principally in and around Denmark. Communities of Danish speakers are also found in Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the northern German region of Southern Schleswig, where it has minority language status. Minor Danish-speaking communities are also found in Norway, Sweden, the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina.

Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the &quot;East Norse&quot; dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language (before the influence of Danish) and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as &quot;West Norse&quot; along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as &quot;mainland (or &quot;continental&quot;) Scandinavian&quot;, while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as &quot;insular Scandinavian&quot;. Although the written languages are compatible, spoken Danish is distinctly different from Norwegian and Swedish and thus the degree of mutual intelligibility with either is variable between regions and speakers.

Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Southern Jutland and Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of the printing press, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated dialect of Copenhagen and Malmö. It spread through use in the education system and administration, though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity, with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though regional variants of the standard language exist. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.

Danish has a very large vowel inventory consisting of 27 phonemically distinctive vowels, and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon , a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set Danish apart from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and &quot;weakly&quot; pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a &quot;difficult language to learn, acquire and understand&quot;, and some evidence shows that children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish compared with other languages. The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns, adjectives, and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. Like English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns. Unlike English, it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its word order is V2, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.

== Classification ==
Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the Old Norse language; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.

Scandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where no sharp dividing lines are seen between the different vernacular languages.

Like Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.

Danish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: Jutlandic (West Danish), Insular Danish (including the standard variety), and East Danish (including Bornholmian and Scanian). According to the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmian is its closest relative.

=== Vocabulary ===

Approximately 2,000 uncompounded Danish words are derived from Old Norse and ultimately from Proto Indo-European. Of these 2,000, 1,200 are nouns, 500 are verbs and 180 are adjectives. Danish has also absorbed many loanwords, most of which were borrowed from Low German of the Late Middle Ages. Out of the 500 most frequently used Danish words, 100 are loans from Middle Low German; this is because Low German was the second official language of Denmark–Norway. In the 17th and 18th centuries, standard German and French superseded Low German influence, and in the 20th century, English became the main supplier of loanwords, especially after World War II. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, for example (to eat) was mostly supplanted by the Low German . As well as loanwords, new words can be freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard texts of contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16–17% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin loans 4–8%, French 2–4% and English about 1%.

Danish and English are both Germanic languages. Danish is a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse, and English is a West Germanic language descended from Old English. Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period.

The shared Germanic heritage of Danish and English is demonstrated with many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, when written, commonly used Danish verbs, nouns, and prepositions such as , , , , , , , and are easily recognizable to English speakers. Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their Scots equivalents, e.g. (Scots , i.e., &#x27;church&#x27;) or (Scots and northern English &quot;bairn&quot;, i.e. &#x27;child&#x27;). In addition, the word , meaning ‘village’ or ‘town’, occurs in many English place-names, such as &quot;Whitby&quot; and &quot;Selby&quot;, as remnants of the Viking occupation. During that period English adopted ‘are’, the third person plural form of the verb ‘to be’, as well as the personal pronouns ‘they’, ‘them’ and ‘their’ from contemporary Old Norse.

=== Mutual intelligibility ===
Danish is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish. A proficient speaker of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that the mutual intelligibility is asymmetric: Norwegian speakers generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Concomitantly, Swedes and Danes understand Norwegian better than they understand each other&#x27;s languages.

Norwegian occupies the middle position in terms of intelligibility because of its shared border with Sweden, resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language, which has led to similarities in vocabulary. Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces. In general, younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as the young in Norway and Sweden.

== History ==

The Danish philologist Johannes Brøndum-Nielsen divided the history of Danish into a period from 800 AD to 1525 to be &quot;Old Danish&quot;, which he subdivided into &quot;Runic Danish&quot; (800–1100), Early Middle Danish (1100–1350) and Late Middle Danish (1350–1525).

=== Runic Danish ===
By the eighth century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse.
This language was generally called the &quot;Danish tongue&quot; (), or &quot;Norse language&quot; (). Norse was written in the runic alphabet, first with the elder futhark and from the 9th century with the younger futhark.

Possibly as far back as the seventh century, the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway. A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong &quot;æi&quot; (Old West Norse &quot;ei&quot;) to the monophthong &quot;e&quot;, as in to . This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read and the later . Also, a change of &quot;au&quot; as in into &quot;ø&quot; as in occurred. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from into . Moreover, the (Old West Norse ) diphthong changed into , as well, as in the Old Norse word for &quot;island&quot;. This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.

Through Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as &quot;gate&quot; () for street, still survive in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia, and parts of eastern England colonized by Danish Vikings. The city of York was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example &quot;knife&quot; (), &quot;husband&quot; (), and &quot;egg&quot; (). The suffix &quot;-by&quot; for &#x27;town&#x27; is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby, and Grimsby. The word &quot;dale&quot; meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.

=== Old and Middle dialects ===

In the medieval period, Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish-language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not Latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350, Danish began to be used as a language of administration, and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.

Throughout this period, Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loan words were introduced in this period. With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. Also in this period, Danish began to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the , the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.

The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the (&quot;Rhyming Chronicle&quot;), a history book told in rhymed verses. The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen, was published in 1550. Pedersen&#x27;s orthographic choices set the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for subsequent writing in Danish. From around 1500, several printing presses were in operation in Denmark publishing in Danish and other languages. In the period after 1550, presses in Copenhagen dominated the publication of material in the Danish language.

=== Early Modern ===

Following the first Bible translation, the development of Danish as a written language, as a language of religion, administration, and public discourse accelerated. In the second half of the 17th century, grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them Rasmus Bartholin&#x27;s 1657 Latin grammar ; then Laurids Olufsen Kock&#x27;s 1660 grammar of the Zealand dialect ; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, (&quot;The Art of the Danish Language&quot;) by Peder Syv. Major authors from this period are Thomas Kingo, poet and psalmist, and Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, whose novel (&quot;Remembered Woes&quot;) is considered a literary masterpiece by scholars. Orthography was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of Jens Pedersen Høysgaard was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the . In this period, scholars were also discussing whether it was best to &quot;write as one speaks&quot; or to &quot;speak as one writes&quot;, including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. &quot;he is&quot; vs. &quot;they are&quot;).

The East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645) after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, beginning also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the Danish chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the &quot;de facto&quot; official standard language, especially in writing—this was the original so-called (&quot;Danish of the Realm&quot;). Also, beginning in the mid-18th century, the , the uvular R sound (), began spreading through Denmark, likely through influence from Parisian French and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden, and coastal southern Norway.

In the 18th century, Danish philology was advanced by Rasmus Rask, who pioneered the disciplines of comparative and historical linguistics, and wrote the first English-language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish continued to develop with the works of Ludvig Holberg, whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by Hans Egede, Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language until the mid-20th century.

=== Standardized national language ===
Following the loss of Schleswig to Germany, a sharp influx of German speakers moved into the area, eventually outnumbering the Danish speakers. The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Danish culture. Authors such as N.F.S. Grundtvig emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish-language authors of this period are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen. The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. Throughout the 19th century, Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the United States, Canada, and Argentina, where memory and some use of Danish remains today.
After the Schleswig referendum in 1920, a number of Danes remained as a minority within German territories.
After the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German-influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter . Three 20th-century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded 1944).

With the exclusive use of , the High Copenhagen Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century, they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country. Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called (&quot;regional languages&quot;) remain, and are in some cases vital. Today, the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagen Standard, associated with elderly, well to-do, and well educated people of the capital, and low Copenhagen speech traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations. Also, in the 21st century, the influence of immigration has had linguistic consequences, such as the emergence of a so-called multiethnolect in the urban areas, an immigrant Danish variety (also known as ), combining elements of different immigrant languages such as Arabic, Turkish, and Kurdish, as well as English and Danish.

== Geographic distribution and status ==
=== Danish Realm ===
Within the Danish Realm, Danish is the national language of Denmark and one of two official languages of the Faroe Islands (alongside Faroese). There is a Faroese variant of Danish known as Gøtudanskt. Until 2009, Danish was also one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside Greenlandic). Danish now acts as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Greenland, with a large percentage of native Greenlanders able to speak Danish as a second language (it was introduced into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928). About 10% of the population speaks Danish as their first language, due to immigration.

Iceland was a territory ruled by Denmark–Norway, one of whose official languages was Danish. Though Danish ceased to be an official language in Iceland in 1944, it is still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school, taught as a second foreign language after English.

No law stipulates an official language for Denmark, making Danish the &quot;de facto&quot; official language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts. Since 1997, public authorities have been obliged to follow the official spelling system laid out in the Orthography Law. In the 21st century, discussions have been held with a view to create a law that would make Danish the official language of Denmark.

===Surrounding countries===

In addition, a noticeable community of Danish speakers is in Southern Schleswig, the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, and a variant of Standard Danish, Southern Schleswig Danish, is spoken in the area. Since 2015, Schleswig-Holstein has officially recognized Danish as a regional language, just as German is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, Danish-speaking citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.

The more widespread of the two varieties of written Norwegian, , is very close to Danish, because standard Danish was used as the &quot;de facto&quot; administrative language until 1814 and one of the official languages of Denmark–Norway. is based on Danish, unlike the other variety of Norwegian, , which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with Old Norwegian as an important reference point. Also North Frisian and Gutnish (Gutamål) were influenced by Danish.

===Other locations===
There are also Danish emigrant communities in other places of the world who still use the language in some form. In the Americas, Danish-speaking communities can be found in the US, Canada, Argentina and Brazil.

== Dialects ==


Standard Danish () is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, Copenhagen. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, which has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.

Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.

Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:
* Insular Danish (), including dialects of the Danish islands of Zealand, Funen, Lolland, Falster, and Møn
* Jutlandic (), further divided in North, East, West, and South Jutlandic
* East Danish (), including dialects of Bornholm (), Scania, Halland and Blekinge

Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn, and Lolland-Falster dialect areas―each with additional internal variation. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark. Since the Swedish conquest of the Eastern Danish provinces Skåne, Halland and Blekinge in 1645/1658, the Eastern Danish dialects there have come under heavy Swedish influence. Many residents now speak regional variants of Standard Swedish. However, many researchers still consider the dialects in Scania, Halland () and Blekinge () as part of the East Danish dialect group. The Swedish National Encyclopedia from 1995 classifies Scanian as &quot;an Eastern Danish dialect with South Swedish elements&quot;.

Traditional dialects differ in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of . Four main regional variants for the realization of stød are known: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland, and Ærø, no is used, but instead a pitch accent (like in Norwegian, Swedish and Gutnish). South of a line (, &#x27;the stød border&#x27;) going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm neither nor pitch accent exists. Most of Jutland and on Zealand use , and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language, occurs more often than in the standard language. In Zealand, the line divides Southern Zealand (without ), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.

Grammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of suffixes, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as West Germanic languages. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three grammatical genders. Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900, Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not. Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: &quot;Katti, han får unger&quot;, literally &quot;The cat, he is having kittens&quot;, because cat is a masculine noun, thus is referred to as (he), even if it is a female cat.

== Phonology ==

The sound system of Danish is unusual, particularly in its large vowel inventory. In informal or rapid speech, the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language&#x27;s prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to perceive the different sounds of the speech flow. These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and research shows Danish children take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.

=== Vowels ===
Although somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels, and two central vowels, and , which only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes – a very large number among the world&#x27;s languages. At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either , , or . The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in . Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. gives 25 &quot;full vowels&quot;, not counting the two unstressed &quot;schwa&quot; vowels.

=== Consonants ===
The consonant inventory is comparatively simple. distinguishes 17 non-syllabic consonant phonemes in Danish.

Many of these phonemes have quite different allophones in onset and coda where intervocalic consonants followed by a full vowel are treated as in onset, otherwise as in coda. Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration. are aspirated in onset realized as , but not in coda. The pronunciation of &quot;t&quot;, , is in between a simple aspirated and a fully affricated (as has happened in German with the second High German consonant shift from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;z&quot;). There is dialectal variation, and some Jutlandic dialects may be less affricated than other varieties, with Northern and Western Jutlandic traditional dialects having an almost unaspirated &quot;dry t&quot;.

 is pronounced as a in syllable coda, so e.g. () is pronounced .

 often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as approximants. Danish differs from the English sound that is conventionally transcribed with the same IPA symbol, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar approximant which is frequently heard as by second language learners.

The sound is found for example in the word /sjovˀ/ &quot;fun&quot; pronounced and &quot;marijuana&quot; pronounced . Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after or and does not occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an allophone of , which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a -phoneme in Danish. Jutlandic dialects often lack the sound and pronounce the &quot;sj&quot; cluster as or .

In onset, is realized as a uvular-pharyngeal approximant, , but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the &quot;r&quot; in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish realization of as guttural – the so-called &quot;skarre-r&quot; – distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled . Only very few, middle-aged or elderly, speakers of Jutlandic retain a frontal which is then usually realised as a flapped or approximant .

=== Prosody ===

Danish is characterized by a prosodic feature called (lit. &quot;thrust&quot;). This is a form of laryngealization or creaky voice. Some sources have described it as a glottal stop, but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon. The occurrence is also dependent on stress, and some varieties also realize it primarily as a tone. The has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in minimal pairs such as (&quot;peasants&quot;) with , versus (&quot;beans&quot;) without . The distribution of in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian pitch accents found in most dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.

Stress is phonemic and distinguishes words such as &quot;cheapest&quot; and &quot;car driver&quot;.

Intonation reflects the stress group, sentence type and prosodic phrase. In Copenhagen Standard Danish, the pitch pattern reaches its lowest peak within the stress group on the stressed syllable followed by its highest peak on the following unstressed syllable, after which it declines gradually until the next stress group.
In interaction, pitch can mark e.g. the end of a story and turn-taking.

== Grammar ==
Similarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut or umlaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs (&quot;takes/took&quot;) and (&quot;foot/feet&quot;)) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as &quot;love/loved&quot;, &quot;car/cars&quot;). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typical for an Indo-European language, Danish follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and onomatopoeia.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an enclitic. A distinctive feature of the Nordic languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typical of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or &quot;strong&quot; stems inflected through umlaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem) (e.g. &quot;foot/feet&quot;, &quot;man/men&quot;) or &quot;weak&quot; stems inflected through affixation (e.g. &quot;ship/ships&quot;, &quot;woman/women&quot;).

==== Gender ====

Standard Danish has two nominal genders: &quot;common&quot; and &quot;neuter&quot;; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the &quot;common&quot; gender, and &quot;neuter&quot; is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized. The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes.

==== Definiteness ====

Definiteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles: either a postposed enclitic or a preposed article which is the obligatory way to mark definiteness when nouns are modified by an adjective. Neuter nouns take the clitic , and common gender nouns take . Indefinite nouns take the articles (common gender) or (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun &quot;a man&quot; (indefinite) has the definite form &quot;the man&quot;, whereas the neuter noun &quot;a house&quot; (indefinite) has the definite form, &quot;the house&quot; (definite) .

Indefinite:
*&quot;Jeg så et hus&quot;: &quot;I saw a house&quot;

Definite with enclitic article:
*&quot;Jeg så huset&quot;: &quot;I saw the house&quot;

Definite with preposed demonstrative article:
*&quot;Jeg så det store hus&quot;: &quot;I saw the big house&quot;

The plural definite ending is (e.g. &quot;boys &gt; &quot;the boys&quot; and &quot;girls&quot; &gt; &quot;the girls&quot;), and nouns ending in lose the last before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. &quot;Danes&quot; &gt; &quot;the Danes&quot;). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article (common) or (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: &quot;the big man&quot;, &quot;the big house&quot;.

==== Number ====

There are three different types of regular plurals: Class 1 forms the plural with the suffix (indefinite) and (definite), Class 2 with the suffix (indefinite) and (definite), and Class 3 takes no suffix for the plural indefinite form and for the plural definite.

Most irregular nouns have an ablaut plural (i.e. with a change in the stem vowel), or combine ablaut stem-change with the suffix, and some have unique plural forms. Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of &quot;eye&quot;, which is the old dual form ), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word &quot;account&quot; which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form &quot;accounts&quot;).

==== Possession ====
Possessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -&quot;s&quot;, for example &quot;my father&#x27;s house&quot; where the noun carries the possessive enclitic. This is however not an example of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases &quot;the king of Denmark&#x27;s candy factory&quot;, where the factory is owned by the king of Denmark, or &quot;that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with&quot;, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.

==== Nominal compounds ====
Like all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in , &quot;the female national handball team&quot;. In some cases, nouns are joined with &quot;s&quot; as a linking element, originally possessive in function, like (from , &quot;country&quot;, and , &quot;man&quot;, meaning &quot;compatriot&quot;), but (from same roots, meaning &quot;farmer&quot;). Some words are joined with the linking element instead, like (from and , meaning &quot;guest book&quot;). There are also irregular linking elements.

=== Pronouns ===
As does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between nominative and oblique case. The nominative form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence (and only when non-coordinated and without a following modifier), and oblique forms are used for all non-subject functions including direct and indirect object, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between animate masculine ( &quot;he&quot;), animate feminine ( &quot;she&quot;) forms, as well as inanimate neuter ( &quot;it&quot;) and inanimate common gender ( &quot;it&quot;).

*: &quot;I sleep&quot;
*: &quot;you sleep&quot;
*: &quot;I kiss you&quot;
*: &quot;you kiss me&quot;

Possessive pronouns have independent and adjectival uses, but the same form. The form is used both adjectivally preceding a possessed noun ( &quot;it is my horse&quot;), and independently in place of the possessed noun ( &quot;it is mine&quot;). In the third person singular, is used when the possessor is also the subject of the sentence, whereas (&quot;his&quot;), (her) and &quot;its&quot; is used when the possessor is different from the grammatical subject.

*&quot;Han tog sin hat&quot;: He took his (own) hat
* &quot;Han tog hans hat&quot;: He took his hat (someone else&#x27;s hat)

=== Verbs ===

Danish verbs are morphologically simple, marking very few grammatical categories. They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.

==== Tense, aspect, mood, and voice ====
Verbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs. The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix and those that take the suffix .

The infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced ), infinitive forms are preceded by the article (pronounced ) in some syntactic functions. The non-past or present tense takes the suffix , except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.

The present participle ends in (e.g. &quot;running&quot;), and the past participle ends in (e.g. &quot;run&quot;), (e.g. købt &quot;bought&quot;). The Perfect is constructed with (&quot;to have&quot;) and participial forms, like in English. But some intransitive verbs form the perfect using (&quot;to be&quot;) instead, and some may use both with a difference in meaning.

* . : &quot;She has walked&quot;. &quot;The plane has flown&quot;
* . : &quot;She has left&quot;. &quot;The plane has taken off&quot;
* . : &quot;She had walked&quot;. &quot;The plane had flown&quot;
* . : &quot;She had left&quot;. &quot;The plane had taken off&quot;

The passive form takes the suffix -s: (&quot;the newspaper is read every day&quot;). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb &quot;to become&quot;: .

The imperative form is the infinitive without the final schwa-vowel, with potentially being applied depending on syllable structure.:
*: &quot;run!&quot;

=== Numerals ===
Certain numerals are formed on the basis of a vigesimal system with various rules. In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered , literally &quot;one and twenty&quot;.

The numeral means (literally &quot;half second&quot;, implying &quot;one plus half of the second one&quot;). The numerals (), () and () are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system described below. Similarly, the temporal designation ()&quot; halv tre&quot;, literally &quot;half three (o&#x27;clock)&quot;, is half past two.

One peculiar feature of the Danish language is that the numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (as are the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, meaning that the score (20) is used as a base unit in counting. (short for , &quot;three times twenty&quot;) means 60, while 50 is (short for , &quot;half third times twenty&quot;, implying two score plus half of the third score). The ending meaning &quot;times twenty&quot; is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but may still be used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as from the now obsolete , whereas 52nd is either or . Twenty is (derived from Old Danish , Old Norse form , meaning &#x27;two tens&#x27;), while thirty is (Old Danish , &quot;three tens&quot;), and forty is (Old Danish , &quot;four tens&quot;, still used today as the archaism ). Thus, the suffix should be understood as a plural of (10), though to modern Danes means 20, making it hard to explain why is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four twenties).

For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the long scale, so that the short-scale billion (1,000,000,000) is called , and the short-scale trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is .

=== Syntax ===
Danish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is Subject–Verb–Object. However, Danish is also a V2 language, which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian Paul Diderichsen Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or &quot;foundation&quot;) field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or topics. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.

*: &quot;Peter saw Jytte&quot;

but

*: &quot;Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte&quot;

When there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a dummy subject &quot;der&quot;.

*: there came a girl in through the door, &quot;A girl came in the door&quot;

==== Main clauses ====
 describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:

Position 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the finite verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.

Questions with wh-words are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.

Wh-question:
*: whom saw she, &quot;whom did she see?&quot;
*: saw she him?, &quot;did she see him?&quot;

==== Subordinate clauses ====
In subordinate clauses, the word order differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation). Complement clauses begin with the particle in the &quot;connector field&quot;.

*&quot;Han sagde, at han ikke ville gå&quot;: he said that he not would go, &quot;He said that he did not want to go&quot;

Relative clauses are marked by the relative pronouns or which occupy the preverbal slot:

*&quot;Jeg kender en mand, som bor i Helsingør: &quot;I know a man who lives in Elsinore&quot;

== Writing system and alphabet ==

The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the Runic alphabet. The introduction of Christianity also brought the Latin script to Denmark. And at the end of the High Middle Ages, runes had more or less been replaced by Latin letters.

Danish orthography is conservative, using most of the conventions established in the 16th century. The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a gap between the spoken and written languages. Since 1955, Dansk Sprognævn has been the official language council in Denmark.

The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: , , and , which come at the end of the alphabet, in that order. The letters , , , and are only used in loan words. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter , already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph . The old usage continues to occur in some personal and geographical names; for example, the name of the city of is spelled with following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and decided to go back to in 2011. When representing the same sound , is treated like in alphabetical sorting, though it appears to be two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations, they are often replaced by (for ), or (for ), and (for ), respectively.

The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense (would), (could) and (should), to their current forms of , and (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of and in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as and .

== Example text ==

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Danish:

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<doc id="8228" wikidata="Q1181697" url="?curid=8228" title="Decade (Neil Young album)">
<text>Decade is a compilation album by Canadian–American musician Neil Young, originally released in 1977 as a triple album and later issued on two compact discs. It contains 35 of Young&#x27;s songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1986.

==History==
Compiled by Young himself, with his hand-written liner notes about each track, &quot;Decade&quot; represents almost every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of &quot;4 Way Street&quot; and &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;. Of the previously unreleased songs, &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; features the New Orleans pianist Dr. John with Buffalo Springfield on an item from their shelved &quot;Stampede&quot; album; &quot;Love Is a Rose&quot; was a minor hit for Linda Ronstadt in 1975; &quot;Winterlong&quot; received a cover by Pixies on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989, &quot;The Bridge&quot;; and &quot;Campaigner&quot; is a Young song critical of Richard Nixon. The track &quot;Long May You Run&quot; is a different mix to that found on the album of the same name, featuring the harmonies of the full Crosby Stills &amp; Nash before David Crosby and Graham Nash left the recording sessions.

For many years, &quot;Decade&quot; was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called &quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot; was released, but it only covered Young&#x27;s 1982–1988 output. It was not until 2004 that Reprise Records released a single-disc retrospective of his best-known tracks, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Throughout the 1980s and &#x27;90s, Young promised fans a follow-up to the original &quot;Decade&quot; collection, provisionally titled &quot;Decade II&quot;; eventually, this idea was scrapped in favor of a much more comprehensive anthology to be titled &quot;Archives&quot;, spanning his entire career and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. The first release of archival material since &quot;Decade&quot; and &quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot; would appear in 2006, &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;, a recording from a 1970 concert featuring Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten. Several other archival live releases followed, and in 2009 the first of several planned multi-disc box sets, &quot;The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972&quot;, was issued. In April 2017 &quot;Decade&quot; was reissued on vinyl as a limited-edition Record Store Day release, with remastered vinyl and CD editions planned for general release in June 2017.

==Alternate early version==
Initially, &quot;Decade&quot; was to be released in 1976, but was pulled at the last minute by Young. It was shelved until the following year, where it appeared with two songs removed from the original track list (a live version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry No Tears&quot; recorded in Japan in 1976, and a live version of &quot;Pushed It Over the End&quot; recorded in 1974). Also removed were the following comments on those two songs and &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;, from Young&#x27;s handwritten liner notes:

==Reception==

The album has been lauded in many quarters as one of the best examples of a career retrospective for a rock artist, and as a template for the box set collections that would follow in the 1980s and beyond. However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the &quot;Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot; and a subsequent article in the &quot;1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;, critic Dave Marsh used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other artists from his generation like Bob Dylan or The Beatles, the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out. The magazine has since excised the article from subsequent editions of the &quot;Illustrated History&quot; book.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Demeter (; Attic: &quot;Dēmḗtēr&quot; ; Doric: &quot;Dāmā́tēr&quot;) is the Olympian goddess of the harvest and agriculture, presiding over crops, grains, food, and the fertility of the earth. Although Demeter is mostly known as a grain goddess, she also appeared as a goddess of health, birth, and marriage, and had connections to the Underworld. She is also called Deo ( &quot;Dēṓ&quot;). In Greek tradition, Demeter is the second child of the Titans Rhea and Cronus, and sister to Hestia, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Like her other siblings except Zeus, she was swallowed by her father as an infant and rescued by Zeus.

Through her brother Zeus, she became the mother of Persephone, a fertility goddess and resurrection deity. One of the most notable &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, tells the story of Persephone&#x27;s abduction by Hades and Demeter&#x27;s search for her. When Hades, the King of the Underworld, wished to make Persephone his wife, he abducted her from a field while she was picking flowers, with Zeus&#x27; leave. Demeter searched everywhere to find her missing daughter to no avail until she was informed that Hades had taken her to the Underworld. In response, Demeter neglected her duties as goddess of agriculture, plunging the earth into a deadly famine where nothing would grow, causing mortals to die. Zeus ordered Hades to return Persephone to her mother to avert the disaster. However, because Persephone had eaten food from the Underworld, she could not stay with Demeter forever, but had to divide the year between her mother and her husband, explaining the seasonal cycle as Demeter does not let plants grow while Persephone is gone.

Her cult titles include Sito (), &quot;she of the Grain&quot;, as the giver of food or grain, and Thesmophoros (, &quot;thesmos&quot;: divine order, unwritten law; , &quot;phoros&quot;: bringer, bearer), &quot;giver of customs&quot; or &quot;legislator&quot;, in association with the secret female-only festival called the Thesmophoria. Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law and the cycle of life and death. She and her daughter Persephone were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a religious tradition that predated the Olympian pantheon and which may have its roots in the Mycenaean period –1200 BC.

Demeter was often considered to be the same figure as the Anatolian goddess Cybele, and she was identified with the Roman goddess Ceres.

Demeter may appear in Linear A as &quot;da-ma-te&quot; on three documents (AR Zf 1 and 2, and KY Za 2), all three dedicated to religious situations and all three bearing just the name (&quot;i-da-ma-te&quot; on AR Zf 1 and 2). It is unlikely that Demeter appears as &quot;da-ma-te&quot; in a Linear B (Mycenean Greek) inscription (PY En 609); the word , &quot;da-ma-te&quot;, probably refers to &quot;households&quot;. On the other hand, , &quot;si-to-po-ti-ni-ja&quot;, &quot;Potnia of the Grain&quot;, is regarded as referring to her Bronze Age predecessor or to one of her epithets.

Demeter&#x27;s character as mother-goddess is identified in the second element of her name &quot;meter&quot; () derived from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) &quot;*méh₂tēr&quot; (mother). In antiquity, different explanations were already proffered for the first element of her name. It is possible that &quot;Da&quot; (), a word which corresponds to &quot;Gē&quot; () in Attic, is the Doric form of &quot;De&quot; (), &quot;earth&quot;, the old name of the chthonic earth-goddess, and that Demeter is &quot;Mother-Earth&quot;. Liddell &amp; Scott find this &quot;improbable&quot; and Beekes writes, &quot;there is no indication that [&quot;da&quot;] means &quot;earth&quot;, although it has also been assumed in the name of Poseidon found in the Linear B inscription &quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot;, &quot;earth-shaker&quot;. John Chadwick also argues that the &quot;dā&quot; element in the name of Demeter is not so simply equated with &quot;earth&quot;.

M. L. West has proposed that the word Demeter, initially &quot;Damater&quot;, could be a borrowing from an Illyrian deity attested in the Messapic goddess &quot;Damatura&quot;, with a form &quot;dā-&quot; (&quot;earth&quot;, from PIE &quot;*dʰǵʰ(e)m-&quot;) attached to -&quot;matura&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;), akin to the Illyrian god Dei-paturos (&quot;dei-&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;, attached to -&quot;paturos,&quot; &quot;father&quot;). The Lesbian form &quot;Dō-&quot; may simply reflect a different colloquial pronunciation of the non-Greek name.

Another theory suggests that the element &quot;De&quot;- might be connected with &quot;Deo&quot;, an epithet of Demeter and it could derive from the Cretan word &quot;dea&quot; (), Ionic &quot;zeia&quot; ()—variously identified with emmer, spelt, rye, or other grains by modern scholars—so that she is the mother and the giver of food generally. This view is shared by British scholar Jane Ellen Harrison, who suggests that Démeter&#x27;s name means &quot;Grain-Mother&quot;, instead of &quot;Earth-Mother&quot;.

An alternative Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through Potnia and Despoina, where &quot;Des-&quot; represents a derivative of PIE &quot;*dem&quot; (house, dome), and Demeter is &quot;mother of the house&quot; (from PIE &quot;*dems-méh₂tēr&quot;). R. S. P. Beekes rejects a Greek interpretation, but not necessarily an Indo-European one.

==Iconography==

Demeter was frequently associated with images of the harvest, including flowers, fruit, and grain. She was also sometimes pictured with her daughter Persephone. However, Demeter is not generally portrayed with any of her consorts; the exception is Iasion, the youth of Crete who lay with her in a thrice-ploughed field and was killed afterward by a jealous Zeus with a thunderbolt.

Demeter is assigned the zodiac constellation Virgo, the Virgin, by Marcus Manilius in his 1st-century Roman work Astronomicon. In art, the constellation Virgo holds Spica, a sheaf of wheat in her hand and sits beside constellation Leo the Lion.

In Arcadia, she was known as &quot;Black Demeter&quot;. She was said to have taken the form of a mare to escape the pursuit of her younger brother, Poseidon, and having been raped by him despite her disguise, she dressed all in black and retreated into a cave to mourn and to purify herself. She was consequently depicted with the head of a horse in this region.

A sculpture of the Black Demeter was made by Onatas.

==Description==
In the earliest conceptions of Demeter she is the goddess of grain and threshing, however her functions were extended beyond the fields and she was often identified with the earth goddess (Gaia). Some of the epithets of Gaia and Demeter are similar showing the identity of their nature. In most of her myths and cults, Demeter is the &quot;Grain-Mother&quot; or the &quot;Earth-Mother&quot;. In the older chthonic cults the earth goddess was related to the Underworld and in the secret rites (mysteries) Demeter and Persephone share the double function of death and fertility. Demeter is the giver of the secret rites and the giver of the laws of cereal agriculture. She was occasionally identified with the &quot;Great Mother&quot; Rhea-Cybele who was worshipped in Crete and Asia Minor with the music of cymbals and violent rites. It seems that poppies were connected with the cult of the Great Mother.

===As an agricultural goddess===
In epic poetry and Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Demeter is the Grain-Mother, the goddess of cereals who provides grain for bread and blesses its harvesters. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the light-haired Demeter with the help of the wind separates the grain from the chaff. Homer mentions the Thalysia a Greek harvest-festival of first fruits in honour of Demeter . In Hesiod, prayers to Zeus-Chthonios (chthonic Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong. This was her main function at Eleusis, and she became panhellenic. In Cyprus, &quot;grain-harvesting&quot; was &quot;damatrizein&quot;. Demeter was the &quot;zeidoros arοura&quot;, the Homeric &quot;Mother Earth arοura&quot; who gave the gift of cereals (&quot;zeai&quot; or &quot;deai&quot;).

Most of the epithets of Demeter describe her as a goddess of grain. Her name &quot;Deo&quot; in literature probably relates her with &quot;deai&quot; a Cretan word for cereals. In Attica she was called Haloas (of the threshing floor) according to the earliest conception of Demeter as the Corn-Mother. She was sometimes called &quot;Chloe&quot; (ripe-grain or fresh-green) and sometimes &quot;Ioulo&quot; (ioulos : grain sheaf). &quot;Chloe&quot; was the goddess of young corn and young vegetation and &quot;Iouloi&quot; were harvest songs in honour of the goddess. The reapers called Demeter &quot;Amallophoros&quot; (bringer of sheaves) and &quot;Amaia&quot; (reaper). The goddess was the giver of abundance of food and she was known as &quot;Sito&quot; (of the grain) and &quot;Himalis&quot; (of abundance ). The bread from the first harvest-fruits was called &quot;thalysian bread&quot; (Thalysia) in honour of Demeter. The sacrificial cakes burned on the altar were called &quot;ompniai&quot; and in Attica the goddess was known as &quot;Ompnia&quot; (related to corns). These cakes were offered to all gods.
In some feasts big loafs (&quot;artoi&quot;) were offered to the goddess and in Boeotia she was known as
&quot;Megalartos&quot; (of the big loaf) and &quot;Megalomazos&quot; (of the big mass, or big porridge). Her function was extended to vegetation generally and to all fruits and she had the epithets &quot;eukarpos&quot; (of good crop), &quot;karpophoros&quot; (bringer of fruits), &quot;malophoros&quot; (apple bearer) and sometimes &quot;Oria&quot; (all the fruits of the season). These epithets show an identity in nature with the earth goddess.

The central theme in the Eleusinian Mysteries was the reunion of Persephone with her mother, Demeter when new crops were reunited with the old seed, a form of eternity.

According to the Athenian rhetorician Isocrates, Demeter&#x27;s greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture which gave to men a civilized way of life, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.

These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter&#x27;s myths and mystery cults. Demeter is the giver of mystic rites and the giver of the civilized way of life (teaching the laws of agriculture). Her epithet &quot;Eleusinia&quot; relates her with the Eleusinian mysteries, however at Sparta &quot;Eleusinia&quot; had an early use, and it was probably a name rather than an epithet. Demeter &quot;Thesmophoros&quot; (law-giving) is closely associated to the laws of cereal agriculture. The festival Thesmophoria was celebrated throughout Greece and was connected to a form of agrarian magic. Her epithet (as paired with Auxesia for Persephone) was the center of the festival called the &quot;Lithobolia&quot;. Near Pheneus in Arcadia she was known as Demeter-&quot;Thesmia&quot; (lawfull), and she received rites according to the local version.

Demeter&#x27;s emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.

===As an earth and underworld goddess===

In addition to her role as an agricultural goddess, Demeter was often worshipped more generally as a goddess of the earth, from which crops spring up. Her individuality was rooted to the less developed personality of Gaia (earth). In Arcadia Demeter &quot;Melaina&quot; (the black Demeter) was represented as snake-haired with a horse&#x27;s head holding a dove and dolphin, perhaps to symbolize her power over the Underworld, the air, and the water. The cult of Demeter in the region was related to Despoina, a very old chthonic divinity. Demeter shares the double function of death and fertility with her daughter Persephone. Demeter and Persephone were called &quot;Despoinai&quot; (the mistresses) and &quot;Demeters&quot;. This duality was also used in the classical period (&quot;Thesmophoroi&quot;, &quot;Double named goddesses&quot;) and particularly in an oath: &quot;By the two goddesses&quot;.

In the cult of Phlya she was worshipped as &quot;Anesidora&quot; who sends up gifts from the Underworld.

In Sparta, she was known as Demeter-&quot;Chthonia&quot; (chthonic Demeter). After each death the mourning should end with a sacrifice to the goddess. Pausanias believes that her cult was introduced from Hermione, where Demeter was associated with Hades. In a local legend a hollow in the earth was the entrance to the underworld, by which the souls could pass easily. In Elis she was called Demeter-&quot;Chamyne&quot; (goddess of the ground), in an old chthonic cult associated with the descent to Hades. At Levadia the goddess was known as Demeter-&quot;Europa&quot; and she was associated with Trophonius, an old divinity of the underworld. The oracle of Trophonius was famous in the antiquity.

Pindar uses the rare epithet &quot;Chalkokrotos&quot; (bronze sounding). Brazen musical instruments were used in the mysteries of Demeter and the Great-Mother Rhea-Cybele was also worshipped with the music of cymbals.
In central Greece Demeter was known as Amphictyonis (of the dwellers-round), in a cult of the goddess at Anthele near Thermopylae (hot gates). She was the patron goddess of an ancient Amphictyony. Thermopylae is the place of hot springs considered to be entrances to Hades, since Demeter was a chthonic goddess in the older local cults.

The Athenians called the dead &quot;Demetrioi&quot;, and this may reflect a link between Demeter and the ancient cult of the dead, linked to the agrarian belief that a new life would sprout from the dead body, as a new plant arises from buried seed. This was most likely a belief shared by initiates in Demeter&#x27;s mysteries, as interpreted by Pindar: &quot;Blessed is he who has seen before he goes under the earth; for he knows the end of life and knows also its divine beginning.&quot;

In Arcadia Demeter had the epithets &quot;Erinys&quot; (fury) and &quot;Melaina&quot; (black) which are associated with the myth of Demeter&#x27;s rape by Poseidon. The epithets stress the darker side of her character and her relation to the dark underworld, in an old chthonic cult associated with wooden structures (xoana). Erinys had a similar function with the avenging Dike (Justice). In the mysteries of Pheneus the goddess was known as &quot;Cidaria&quot;. Her priest would put on the mask of Demeter, which was kept secret. The cult may have been connected with both the Underworld and a form of agrarian magic.

===As a poppy goddess===

Theocritus described one of Demeter&#x27;s earlier roles as that of a goddess of poppies:
Karl Kerényi asserted that poppies were connected with a Cretan cult which was eventually carried to the Eleusinian Mysteries in Classical Greece. In a clay statuette from Gazi, the Minoan poppy goddess wears the seed capsules, sources of nourishment and narcosis, in her diadem. According to Kerényi, &quot;It seems probable that the Great Mother Goddess who bore the names Rhea and Demeter, brought the poppy with her from her Cretan cult to Eleusis and it is almost certain that in the Cretan cult sphere opium was prepared from poppies.&quot;

==Worship==
===In Crete===
In an older tradition in Crete the vegetation cult was related with the deity of the cave. During the Bronze Age, a goddess of nature dominated both in Minoan and Mycenean cults. In the Linear B inscriptions &quot;po-ti-ni-ja&quot; (potnia) refers to the goddess of nature who was concerned with birth and vegetation and had certain chthonic apects. Some scholars believe that she was the universal mother goddess. A Linear B inscription at Knossos mentions the potnia of the labyrinth &quot;da-pu-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja&quot;. Poseidon was often given the title &quot;wa-na-ka&quot; (&quot;wanax&quot;) in Linear B inscriptions in his role as King of the Underworld, and his title &quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot; indicates his chthonic nature. He was the male companion (paredros) of the goddess in the Minoan and probably Mycenean cult. In the cave of Amnisos, &quot;Enesidaon&quot; is associated with the cult of Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, who was involved with the annual birth of the divine child. Elements of this early form of worship survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered: &quot;the mighty Potnia had born a strong son.&quot;

===On the Greek mainland===

Tablets from Pylos of BC record sacrificial goods destined for &quot;the Two Queens and Poseidon&quot; (&quot;to the Two Queens and the King&quot;:&quot;wa-na-ssoi&quot;, &quot;wa-na-ka-te&quot;). The &quot;Two Queens&quot; may be related to Demeter and Persephone or their precursors, goddesses who were no longer associated with Poseidon in later periods. In Pylos &quot;potnia&quot; (mistress) is the major goddess of the city and &quot;wanax &quot; in the tablets has a similar nature with her male consort in the Minoan cult. Potnia retained some chthonic cults, and in popular religion these were related to the goddess Demeter. In Greek religion &quot;potniai&quot;(mistresses) appear in plural (like the Erinyes) and are closely related to the Eleusinian Demeter.

Major cults to Demeter are known at Eleusis in Attica, Hermion (in Crete), Megara, Celeae, Lerna, Aegila, Munychia, Corinth, Delos, Priene, Akragas, Iasos, Pergamon, Selinus, Tegea, Thoricus, Dion (in Macedonia) Lykosoura, Mesembria, Enna, and Samothrace.

Probably the earliest Amphictyony centred on the cult of Demeter at Anthele (Ἀνθήλη), lay on the coast of Malis south of Thessaly, near Thermopylae.

Mysian Demeter had a seven-day festival at Pellené in Arcadia. The geographer Pausanias passed the shrine to Mysian Demeter on the road from Mycenae to Argos and reports that according to Argive tradition, the shrine was founded by an Argive named Mysius who venerated Demeter.
====&quot;Saint Demetra&quot;====
Even after Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica and banned paganism throughout the Roman Empire, people throughout Greece continued to pray to Demeter as &quot;Saint Demetra&quot;, patron saint of agriculture. Around 1765–1766, the antiquary Richard Chandler, alongside the architect Nicholas Revett and the painter William Pars, visited Eleusis and mentioned a statue of a caryatid as well as the folklore that surrounded it, they stated that it was considered sacred by the locals because it protected their crops. They called the statue &quot;Saint Demetra&quot;, a saint whose story had many similarities to the myth of Demeter and Persephone, except that her daughter had been abducted by the Turks and not by Hades. The locals covered the statue with flowers to ensure the fertility of their fields. This tradition continued until 1865, when the statue was forcibly removed by Edward Daniel Clarke and donated to the University of Cambridge. The statue is now located in the Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge.

===Festivals===

Demeter&#x27;s two major festivals were sacred mysteries. Her Thesmophoria festival (11–13 October) was women-only. Her Eleusinian mysteries were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as the mother and Persephone as her daughter.

===Conflation with other goddesses===
In the Roman period, Demeter became conflated with the Roman agricultural goddess Ceres through interpretatio romana. The worship of Demeter has formally merged with that of Ceres around 205 BC, along with the &quot;ritus graecia cereris&quot;, a Greek-inspired form of cult, as part of Rome&#x27;s general religious recruitment of deities as allies against Carthage, towards the end of the Second Punic War. The cult originated in southern Italy (part of Magna Graecia) and was probably based on the Thesmophoria, a mystery cult dedicated to Demeter and Persephone as &quot;Mother and Maiden&quot;. It arrived along with its Greek priestesses, who were granted Roman citizenship so that they could pray to the gods &quot;with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention&quot;. The new cult was installed in the already ancient Temple of Ceres, Liber and Libera, Rome&#x27;s Aventine patrons of the plebs; from the end of the 3rd century BC, Demeter&#x27;s temple at Enna, in Sicily, was acknowledged as Ceres&#x27; oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognized as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to Persephone. Their joint cult recalls Demeter&#x27;s search for Persephone after the latter&#x27;s abduction into the Underworld by Hades. At the Aventine, the new cult took its place alongside the old. It did not refer to Liber, whose open and gender-mixed cult played a central role in plebeian culture as a patron and protector of plebeian rights, freedoms and values. The exclusively female initiates and priestesses of the new &quot;greek style&quot; mysteries of Ceres and Proserpina were expected to uphold Rome&#x27;s traditional, patrician-dominated social hierarchy and traditional morality. Unmarried girls should emulate the chastity of Proserpina, the maiden; married women should seek to emulate Ceres, the devoted and fruitful mother. Their rites were intended to secure a good harvest and increase the fertility of those who partook in the mysteries.

Beginning in the 5th century BCE in Asia Minor, Demeter was also considered equivalent to the Phrygian goddess Cybele. Demeter&#x27;s festival of Thesmophoria was popular throughout Asia Minor, and the myth of Persephone and Adonis in many ways mirrors the myth of Cybele and Attis.

Some late antique sources syncretized several &quot;great goddess&quot; figures into a single deity. For example, the Platonist philosopher Apuleius, writing in the late 2nd century, identified Ceres (Demeter) with Isis, having her declare:
I, mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, first-born of the ages, highest of the gods, queen of the shades, first of those who dwell in heaven, representing in one shape all gods and goddesses. My will controls the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving sea winds, and the mournful silences of hell; the entire world worships my single godhead in a thousand shapes, with divers rites, and under many a different name. The Phrygians, first-born of mankind, call me the Pessinuntian Mother of the gods; ... the ancient Eleusinians Actaean Ceres; ... and the Egyptians who excel in ancient learning, honour me with the worship which is truly mine and call me by my true name: Queen Isis.
:--Apuleius, translated by E. J. Kenny. &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;

==Mythology==
===Lineage, consorts, and offspring===
 Alongside the rest of her siblings, with the exception of her youngest brother Zeus, she was swallowed as a newborn by her father due to his fear of being overthrown by one of his children; she was later freed when Zeus made Cronus disgorge all of his children by giving him a special potion.

Demeter is notable as the mother of Persephone, described by both Hesiod and in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; as the result of a union with her younger brother Zeus. An alternate recounting of the matter appears in a fragment of the lost Orphic theogony, which preserves part of a myth in which Zeus mates with his mother, Rhea, in the form of a snake, explaining the origin of the symbol on Hermes&#x27; staff. Their daughter is said to be Persephone, whom Zeus, in turn, mates with to conceive Dionysus. According to the Orphic fragments, &quot;After becoming the mother of Zeus, she who was formerly Rhea became Demeter.&quot;

There is some evidence that the figures of the Queen of the Underworld and the daughter of Demeter were initially considered separate goddesses. However, they must have become conflated by the time of Hesiod in the 7th century BC. Demeter and Persephone were often worshipped together and were often referred to by joint cultic titles. In their cult at Eleusis, they were referred to simply as &quot;the goddesses&quot;, usually distinguished as &quot;the older&quot; and &quot;the younger&quot;; in Rhodes and Sparta, they were worshipped as &quot;the Demeters&quot;; in the Thesmophoria, they were known as &quot;the thesmophoroi&quot; (&quot;the legislators&quot;). In Arcadia they were known as &quot;the Great Goddesses&quot; and &quot;the mistresses&quot;. In Mycenaean Pylos, Demeter and Persephone were probably called the &quot;queens&quot; (wa-na-ssoi).
Both Homer and Hesiod, writing c. 700 BC, described Demeter making love with the agricultural hero Iasion in a ploughed field during the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia. According to Hesiod, this union resulted in the birth of Plutus.

According to Diodorus Siculus, in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; written in the 1st century BC, Demeter and Zeus were also the parents of Dionysus. Diodorus described the myth of Dionysus&#x27; double birth (once from the earth, i.e. Demeter, when the plant sprouts) and once from the vine (when the fruit sprouts from the plant). Diodorus also related a version of the myth of Dionysus&#x27; destruction by the Titans (&quot;sons of Gaia&quot;), who boiled him, and how Demeter gathered up his remains so that he could be born a third time (Diod. iii.62). Diodorus states that Dionysus&#x27; birth from Zeus and his older sister Demeter was somewhat of a minority belief, possibly via conflation of Demeter with her daughter, as most sources state that the parents of Dionysus were Zeus and Persephone, and later Zeus and Semele.
Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (c. 700 BC) describes Demeter as the second daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and the sister of Hestia, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus.

In Arcadia, a major Arcadian deity known as Despoina (&quot;Mistress&quot;) was said to be the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon. According to Pausanias, a Thelpusian tradition said that during Demeter&#x27;s search for Persephone, Poseidon pursued her. Demeter turned into a horse to avoid her younger brother&#x27;s advances. However, he turned into a stallion and mated with the goddess, resulting in the birth of the horse god Arion and a daughter &quot;whose name they are not wont to divulge to the uninitiated&quot;. Elsewhere, he says that the Phigalians assert that the offspring of Poseidon and Demeter was not a horse, but Despoina, &quot;as the Arcadians call her&quot;.

In Orphic literature, Demeter seems to be the mother of the witchcraft goddess Hecate.

The goddess took Mecon, a young Athenian, as a lover; he was at some point transformed into a poppy flower.

The following is a list of Demeter&#x27;s offspring, by various fathers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source (in some cases approximately) dates.

===Abduction of Persephone===
Demeter&#x27;s daughter Persephone was abducted to the Underworld by Hades, who received permission from her father Zeus to take her as his bride. Demeter searched for her ceaselessly for nine days, preoccupied with her grief. Hecate then approached her and said that while she had not seen what happened to Persephone, she heard her screams. Together the two goddesses went to Helios, the sun god, who witnessed everything that happened on earth thanks to his lofty position. Helios then revealed to Demeter that Hades had snatched a screaming Persephone to make her his wife with the permission of Zeus, the girl&#x27;s father. Demeter then filled with anger. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth and began to die. Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to the Underworld to bring Persephone back. Hades agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm, but Persephone had eaten a small number of pomegranate seeds. This bound her to Hades and the Underworld for certain months of every year, most likely the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought, despite the popular belief that it is autumn or winter. There are several variations on the basic myth; the earliest account, the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, relates that Persephone is secretly slipped a pomegranate seed by Hades and in Ovid&#x27;s version, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. Contrary to popular perception, Persephone&#x27;s time in the Underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient Greek calendar, nor her return to the upper world with springtime. Demeter&#x27;s descent to retrieve Persephone from the Underworld is connected to the Eleusinian Mysteries.

The myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version, Ploutos (πλούτος, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (&quot;pithoi&quot;). Similar subterranean &quot;pithoi&quot; were used in ancient times for funerary practices. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother, Demeter, for at this time, the old crop and the new meet each other.
In the Orphic tradition, while she was searching for her daughter, a mortal woman named Baubo received Demeter as her guest and offered her a meal and wine. Demeter declined them both because she mourned the loss of Persephone. Baubo then, thinking she had displeased the goddess, lifted her skirt and showed her genitalia to the goddess, simultaneously revealing Iacchus, Demeter&#x27;s son. Demeter was most pleased with the sight and delighted she accepted the food and wine. This tale survives in the account of Clement of Alexandria, an early Christian writer who wrote about pagan practices and mythology. Several Baubo figurines (figurines of women revealing their vulvas) have been discovered, supporting the story.

===Demeter at Eleusis===

Demeter&#x27;s search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. She assumed the form of an old woman and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse Demophon and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the hearth&#x27;s flames to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he, in turn, taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as Eleusis, Rarus and Trochilus. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.
===Demeter and Iasion===
Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c. late 8th century BC) contains perhaps the earliest direct references to the myth of Demeter and her consort Iasion, a Samothracian hero whose name may refer to bindweed, a small white flower that frequently grows in wheat fields. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Calypso describes how Demeter, &quot;without disguise&quot;, made love to Iasion. &quot;So it was when Demeter of the braided tresses followed her heart and lay in love with Iasion in the triple-furrowed field; Zeus was aware of it soon enough and hurled the bright thunderbolt and killed him.&quot; However, Ovid states that Iasion lived up to old age as the husband of Demeter. In ancient Greek culture, part of the opening of each agricultural year involved the cutting of three furrows in the field to ensure its fertility.

Hesiod expanded on the basics of this myth. According to him, the liaison between Demeter and Iasion took place at the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia in Crete. Demeter, in this version, had lured Iasion away from the other revellers. Hesiod says that Demeter subsequently gave birth to Plutus.

===Demeter and Poseidon===

In Arcadia, located in what is now southern Greece, the major goddess Despoina was considered the daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios (&quot;Horse-Poseidon&quot;). In the associated myths, Poseidon represents the river spirit of the Underworld, and he appears as a horse, as often happens in northern European folklore. The myth describes how he pursued his older sister, Demeter, who hid from him among the horses of the king Onkios, but even in the form of a mare, she could not conceal her divinity. Poseidon caught and raped his older sister in the form of a stallion. Demeter was furious at Poseidon&#x27;s assault; in this furious form, she became known as &quot;Demeter Erinys&quot;. Her anger at Poseidon drove her to dress all in black and retreat into a cave to purify herself, an act which was the cause of a universal famine. Demeter&#x27;s absence caused the death of crops, livestock, and eventually of the people who depended on them (later Arcadian tradition held that it was &quot;both&quot; her rage at Poseidon and her loss of her daughter caused the famine, merging the two myths). Demeter washed away her anger in the River Ladon, becoming &quot;Demeter Lousia&quot;, the &quot;bathed Demeter&quot;.

&quot;In her alliance with Poseidon,&quot; Kerényi noted, &quot;she was Earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of grain or a mare.&quot; Moreover, she bore a daughter Despoina (: the &quot;Mistress&quot;), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian Mysteries, and a horse named Arion, with a black mane and tail.

At Phigaleia, a &quot;xoanon&quot; (wood-carved statue) of Demeter was erected in a cave which, tradition held, was the cave into which Black Demeter retreated. The statue depicted a Medusa-like figure with a horse&#x27;s head and snake-like hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, which probably represented her power over air and water:

===Demeter and Erysichthon===
Another myth involving Demeter&#x27;s rage resulting in famine is that of Erysichthon, king of Thessaly. The myth tells of Erysichthon ordering all of the trees in one of Demeter&#x27;s sacred groves to be cut down, as he wanted to build an extension of his palace and hold feasts there. One tree, a huge oak, was covered with votive wreaths, symbols of the prayers Demeter had granted, so Erysichthon&#x27;s men refused to cut it down. The king used an axe to cut it down, killing a dryad nymph in the process. The nymph&#x27;s dying words were a curse on Erysichthon. Demeter punished the king by calling upon Limos, the spirit of unrelenting and insatiable hunger, to enter his stomach. The more the king ate, the hungrier he became. Erysichthon sold all his possessions to buy food but was still hungry. Finally, he sold his daughter, Mestra, into slavery. Mestra was freed from slavery by her former lover, Poseidon, who gave her the gift of shape-shifting into any creature to escape her bonds. Erysichthon used her shape-shifting ability to sell her numerous times to make more money to feed himself, but no amount of food was enough. Eventually, Erysichthon ate himself.

In a variation, Erysichthon tore down a temple of Demeter, wishing to build a roof for his house; she punished him the same way, and near the end of his life, she sent a snake to plague him. Afterwards, Demeter put him among the stars (the constellation Ophiuchus), as she did the snake, to continue to inflict its punishment on Erysichthon.

In the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the battle of the gods against the Giants (Gigantomachy), survive remains of what seems to have been Demeter fighting a Giant labelled &quot;Erysichthon.&quot; Demeter is also depicted fighting against the Giants next to Hermes in the Suessula Gigantomachy vase, now housed in the Louvre Museum. Usually, ancient depictions of the Gigantomachy tend to exclude Demeter due to her non-martial nature.

===Wrath myths===

While travelling far and wide looking for her daughter, Demeter arrived exhausted in Attica. A woman named Misme took her in and offered her a cup of water with pennyroyal and barley groats, for it was a hot day. Demeter, in her thirst, swallowed the drink clumsily. Witnessing that, Misme&#x27;s son Ascalabus laughed, mocked her, and asked her if she would like a deep jar of that drink. Demeter then poured her drink over him and turned him into a gecko, hated by both men and gods. It was said that Demeter showed her favour to those who killed geckos.

Before Hades abducted her daughter, he had kept the nymph Minthe as his mistress. But after he married Persephone, he set Minthe aside. Minthe would often brag about being lovelier than Persephone and say Hades would soon come back to her and kick Persephone out of his halls. Demeter, hearing that, grew angry and trampled Minthe; from the earth then sprang a lovely-smelling herb named after the nymph. In other versions, Persephone herself is the one who kills and turns Minthe into a plant for sleeping with Hades.

In an Argive myth, when Demeter arrived in Argolis, a man named Colontas refused to receive her in his house, whereas his daughter Chthonia disapproved of his actions. Colontas was punished by being burnt along with his house, while Demeter took Chthonia to Hermione, where she built a sanctuary for the goddess.

Demeter pinned Ascalaphus under a rock for reporting, as sole witness, to Hades that Persephone had consumed some pomegranate seeds. Later, after Heracles rolled the stone off Ascalaphus, Demeter turned him into a short-eared owl instead.

Demeter also turned the Sirens into half-bird monsters for not helping her daughter Persephone when she was abducted by Hades.

Once, the Colchian princess Medea ended a famine that plagued Corinth by making sacrifices to Demeter and the nymphs.

===Favour myths===
Demeter gave Triptolemus her serpent-drawn chariot (one of the serpents that drew this chariot was Kykreides) and seed and bade him scatter it across the earth (teach humankind the knowledge of agriculture). Triptolemus rode through Europe and Asia until he came to the land of Lyncus, a Scythian king. Lyncus pretended to offer what&#x27;s accustomed of hospitality to him, but once Triptolemus fell asleep, he attacked him with a dagger, wanting to take credit for his work. Demeter then saved Triptolemus by turning Lyncus into a lynx and ordered Triptolemus to return home airborne. Hyginus records a very similar myth, in which Demeter saves Triptolemus from an evil king named Carnabon who additionally seized Triptolemus&#x27; chariot and killed one of the dragons, so he might not escape; Demeter restored the chariot to Triptolemus, substituted the dead dragon with another one, and punished Carnabon by putting him among the stars holding a dragon as if to kill it.

During her wanderings, Demeter came upon the town of Pheneus; to the Pheneates that received her warmly and offered her shelter, she gave all sorts of pulse, except for beans, deeming it impure. Two of the Pheneates, Trisaules and Damithales, had a temple of Demeter built for her. Demeter also gifted a fig tree to Phytalus, an Eleusinian man, for welcoming her in his home.

In the tale of Eros and Psyche, Demeter, along with her sister Hera, visited Aphrodite, raging with fury about the girl who had married her son. Aphrodite asks the two to search for her; the two try to talk sense into her, arguing that her son is not a little boy, although he might appear as one, and there&#x27;s no harm in him falling in love with Psyche. Aphrodite took offence at their words. Sometime later, Psyche in her wanderings came across an abandoned shrine of Demeter, and sorted out the neglected sickles and harvest implements she found there. As she was doing so, Demeter appeared to her and called from afar; she warned the girl of Aphrodite&#x27;s great wrath and her plan to take revenge on her. Then Psyche begged the goddess to help her, but Demeter answered that she could not interfere and incur Aphrodite&#x27;s anger at her, and for that reason, Psyche had to leave the shrine or else be kept as a captive of hers.
When her son Philomelus invented the plough and used it to cultivate the fields, Demeter was so impressed by his good work that she immortalized him in the sky by turning him into a constellation, the Boötes.

Hierax, a man of justice and distinction, set up sanctuaries for Demeter and received plenteous harvests from her in return. When the tribe neglected Poseidon in favour of Demeter, the sea god destroyed all of her crops, so Hierax sent them instead his own food and was transformed into a hawk by Poseidon.

Besides giving gifts to those who were welcoming to her, Demeter was also a goddess who nursed the young; all of Plemaeus&#x27;s children born by his first wife died in a cradle; Demeter took pity on him and reared herself his son Orthopolis. Plemaeus built a temple to her to thank her. Demeter also raised Trophonius, the prophetic son of either Apollo or Erginus.

===Other accounts===
Demeter seems to have accompanied Dionysus when he descended into the Underworld to retrieve his mother Semele in order to visit her now married daughter, and perhaps lead her back to the land of the living for the remainder of the year. In many vases from Athens Dionysus is seen in the company of mother and daughter.

Once Tantalus, a son of Zeus, invited the gods over for dinner. Tantalus, wanting to test them, cut his son Pelops, cooked him and offered him as a meal to them. They all saw through Tantalus&#x27; crime except Demeter, who ate Pelops&#x27; shoulder before the gods brought him back to life.

<text>Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking; deep growling vocals; aggressive, powerful drumming, featuring double kick and blast beat techniques; minor keys or atonality; abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes; and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence, political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, true crime and science fiction.

Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s. Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre&#x27;s creation. Possessed, Death, Necrophagia, Obituary, Autopsy, and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as a popular genre. Niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.

Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning several subgenres. Melodic death metal combines death metal elements with those of the new wave of British heavy metal. Technical death metal is a complex style, with uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms, and unusual harmonies and melodies. Death-doom combines the deep growled vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal with the slow tempos and melancholic atmosphere of doom metal. Deathgrind, goregrind, and pornogrind mix the complexity of death metal with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore. Deathcore combines death metal with metalcore traits. Death &#x27;n&#x27; roll combines death metal&#x27;s growled vocals and highly distorted, detuned guitar riffs with elements of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.

==History==

===Emergence and early history===

English extreme metal band Venom, from Newcastle, crystallized the elements of what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their first two albums &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; and &quot;Black Metal&quot;, released in late 1981 and 1982, respectively. Their dark, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands. Another highly influential band, Slayer, formed in 1981. Although the band was a thrash metal act, Slayer&#x27;s music was more violent than their thrash contemporaries Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Their breakneck speed and instrumental prowess combined with lyrics about death, violence, war, and Satanism won Slayer a cult following. According to Mike McPadden, &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;, Slayer&#x27;s second album, &quot;largely invent[ed] much of the sound and fury that would evolve into death metal.&quot; According to AllMusic, their third album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; inspired the entire death metal genre. It had a big impact on genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, and Morbid Angel.

Possessed, a band that formed in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1983, is described by AllMusic as &quot;connecting the dots&quot; between thrash metal and death metal with their 1985 debut album, &quot;Seven Churches&quot;. While attributed as having a Slayer influence, current and former members of the band had actually cited Venom and Motörhead, as well as early work by Exodus, as the main influences on their sound. Although the group had released only two studio albums and an EP in their formative years, they have been described by music journalists and musicians as either being &quot;monumental&quot; in developing the death metal style, or as being the first death metal band. Earache Records noted that &quot;the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they were doing in their formative years on the Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary &quot;Seven Churches&quot; recording. Possessed arguably did more to further the cause of &#x27;Death Metal&#x27; than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80&#x27;s.&quot;

During the same period as the dawn of Possessed, a second influential metal band was formed in Orlando, Florida. Originally called Mantas, Death was formed in 1983 by Chuck Schuldiner, Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz. Inspired by the Brandon, Florida act Nasty Savage, they took the sound of Nasty Savage and deepened it. In 1984, they released their first demo entitled &quot;Death by Metal&quot;, followed by several more. The tapes circulated through the tape trader world, quickly establishing the band&#x27;s name. With Death guitarist Schuldiner adopting vocal duties, the band made a major impact in the emerging Florida death metal scene. The fast minor-key riffs and solos were complemented with fast drumming, creating a style that would catch on in tape trading circles. Schuldiner has been credited by AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia for being widely recognized as the &quot;Father of Death Metal&quot;. Death&#x27;s 1987 debut release, &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot;, has been described by About.com&#x27;s Chad Bowar as being the &quot;evolution from thrash metal to death metal&quot;, and &quot;the first true death metal record&quot; by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In an Interview Jeff Becerra talked about the discussions of being the creator of the genre, saying that Schuldiner cited Possessed as a massive influence, and Death were even called &quot;Possessed clones&quot; early on. Along with Possessed and Death, other pioneers of death metal in the United States include Macabre, Master, Massacre, Immolation, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, and Post Mortem.

===Growing popularity===
By 1989, many bands had been signed by eager record labels wanting to cash in on the subgenre, including Florida&#x27;s Obituary, Morbid Angel and Deicide. This collective of death metal bands hailing from Florida are often labeled as &quot;Florida death metal&quot;. Morbid Angel pushed the genre&#x27;s limits both musically and lyrically, with the release of their debut album &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; in 1989. The album &quot;redefined what it meant to be heavy while influencing an upcoming class of brutal death metal.&quot; According to Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic, &quot;Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children&#x27;s music.&quot;

Following the original death metal innovators, new subgenres began to develop the end of the decade, such as melodic death metal. Death released their fourth album &quot;Human&quot; in 1991, which has become a hallmark in technical death metal. Death&#x27;s founder Schuldiner helped push the boundaries of the genre with uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, combining intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos.

Earache Records, Relativity Records and Roadrunner Records became the genre&#x27;s most important labels, with Earache releasing albums by Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, and Roadrunner releasing albums by Obituary, and Pestilence. Although these labels had not been death metal labels, they initially became the genre&#x27;s flagship labels at the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to these, other labels formed as well, such as Nuclear Blast, Century Media, and Peaceville. Many of these labels would go on to achieve successes in other genres of metal throughout the 1990s.

In September 1990, Death&#x27;s manager Eric Greif held one of the first North American death metal festivals, &quot;Day of Death&quot;, in Milwaukee suburb Waukesha, Wisconsin, and featured 26 bands including Autopsy, Broken Hope, Hellwitch, Obliveon, Revenant, Viogression, Immolation, Atheist, and Cynic.

===Later history===
Death metal&#x27;s popularity achieved its initial peak during 1992–1993, with some bands such as Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse enjoying mild commercial success. However, the genre as a whole never broke into the mainstream. The genre&#x27;s mounting popularity may have been partly responsible for a strong rivalry between Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal scenes. Fenriz of Darkthrone has noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were &quot;fed up with the whole death metal scene&quot; at the time. Death metal diversified in the 1990s, spawning a rich variety of subgenres that still have a large &quot;underground&quot; following at the present.

In the 2000s, a number of bands in the hardcore punk scene, including Black Breath and Trap Them began to incorporate elements of death metal into their sound. This was followed by a wave of bands expanding upon the death-doom style of Incantation while incorporating elements of ambient music, including Dead Congregation and Necros Christos.

In the 2010s, a movement of bands reviving the sound of original 1980s death metal emerged, termed the &quot;New Wave of Old School Death Metal&quot;. One of the earliest groups in this wave was Horrendous, who formed in 2009, who along with Tomb Mold took a progressive take the genre. Tomb Mold, Necrot, Undergang and Blood Incantation were some of the earliest bands to gain traction in the 2010s, with the COVID-19 pandemic amplifying the amount of attention drawn to the movement, through Cryptic Shift, Slimelord and Vaticinal Rites. In a 2022 article by &quot;MetalSucks&quot; writer Christopher Krovatin stated &quot;Right now, as a music journalist, all I hear about is death metal.&quot; In the UK, this movement became the &quot;New Wave of British Death Metal&quot;, fronted by Mortuary Spawn, Vacuous and Celestial Sanctuary, this name being coined by Tom Cronin, of Celestial Sanctuary, in order to separate these hardcore-indebted bands from the country&#x27;s prior movements. The earliest bands in this wave were Cruciamentum and Grave Miasma.

A large part of the New Wave of Old School Death Metal was death metal bands who originated from the hardcore scene, some of which merge elements of hardcore into their style. Xibalba and Fuming Mouth were two of the earliest groups, with the wave being solidified by Gatecreeper, 200 Stab Wounds, Creeping Death, Sanguisugabogg and Kruelty. Venom Prison came from this scene and gained particular attention for their confrontation of what &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called death metal&#x27;s &quot;misogyny problem&quot;, by instead writing &quot;rape-revenge narrative[s]&quot;. Their lead vocalist Larissa Stupar was described by the publication as &quot;metal&#x27;s most important - and uncompromising - voice&quot;.

==Characteristics==

===Instrumentation===
The setup most frequently used within the death metal genre is two guitarists, a bass player, a vocalist, and a drummer often using &quot;hyper double-bass blast beats&quot;. Although this is the standard setup, bands have been known to occasionally incorporate other instruments such as electronic keyboards.

===Vocals and lyrics===
Death metal vocals are referred to as death growls; which are coarse roars/snarls. Death growling is mistakenly thought to be a form of screaming using the lowest vocal register known as vocal fry, however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while growling can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, &quot;true&quot; death growling is in fact created by an altogether different technique. Growling has been called Cookie Monster vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character of the same name. Although often criticized, death growls serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal&#x27;s aggressive lyrical content.

The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylised violence, but may also extend to topics like religion (sometimes including Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, theology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics. Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including blood and gore, psychopathy, delirium, mutilation, mutation, dissection, exorcism, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris commented this apparent glamorisation of violence may be attributed to a &quot;fascination&quot; with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination that mixes desire and disgust. Heavy metal author Gavin Baddeley also stated there does seem to be a connection between &quot;how acquainted one is with their own mortality&quot; and &quot;how much they crave images of death and violence&quot; via the media. Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry. This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorisation of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.

According to Alex Webster, bassist of Cannibal Corpse, &quot;The gory lyrics are probably not, as much as people say, [what&#x27;s keeping us] from being mainstream. Like, &#x27;death metal would never go into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?&#x27; I think it&#x27;s really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream.&quot;

Christian death metal bands often utilize the gory themes of death metal to invoke violent imagery against Satan, demons, sin and sinners, much of the violent imagery being drawn from the Bible. Satanic and anti-Christian imagery is also frequently inverted.

==Etymology==

The most popular theory of the subgenre&#x27;s christening is Possessed&#x27;s 1984 demo, &quot;Death Metal&quot;; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band&#x27;s 1985 debut album, &quot;Seven Churches&quot;. Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment. Another possible origin was a magazine called &quot;Death Metal&quot;, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation &quot;Death Metal&quot; released by Noise Records. The term might also have originated from other recordings, such as the demo released by Death in 1984, called &quot;Death by Metal&quot;.

==Subgenres and fusion genres==

Cited examples are not necessarily exclusive to one particular style. Many bands can easily be placed in two or more of the following categories, and a band&#x27;s specific categorization is often a source of contention due to personal opinion and interpretation. The musical genres in this list are sorted alphabetically.

===Blackened death-doom===
Blackened death-doom is a microgenre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal. Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast, Faustcoven, The Ruins of Beverast, Bölzer, Necros Christos, Harvest Gulgaltha, Dragged into Sunlight, Hands of Thieves, and Soulburn. Kim Kelly, journalist from Vice, has called Faustcoven as &quot;one of the finest bands to ever successfully meld black, death, and doom metal into a cohesive, legible whole.&quot;

===Blackened death metal===

Blackened death metal is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti-Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal. Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal. Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre. Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor, Behemoth, Akercocke, and Sacramentum.

====Melodic black-death====
Melodic black-death (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal) is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative. Some bands who have played this style include Dissection, Sacramentum, Naglfar, God Dethroned, Dawn, Unanimated, Thulcandra, Skeletonwitch and Cardinal Sin.

====War metal====
War metal (also known as war black metal or bestial black metal) is an aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic subgenre of blackened death metal, described by &quot;Rock Hard&quot; journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann as &quot;rabid&quot; and &quot;hammering&quot;. Important influences include first wave black metal band Sodom, first wave black metal/death metal band Possessed as well as old grindcore, black and death metal bands like Repulsion, Autopsy, Sarcófago and the first two Sepultura releases. War metal bands include Blasphemy, Archgoat, Impiety, In Battle, Beherit, Crimson Thorn, Bestial Warlust, and Zyklon-B.

===Brutal death metal===

Brutal death metal is a subgenre of death metal that privileges heaviness, speed, and complex rhythms over other aspects, such as melody and timbres. Brutal death metal bands employ high-speed, palm-muted power chording and single-note riffage. Notable bands include Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, and Skinless.

====Slam death metal====

Slam death metal is a brutal death metal microgenre that evolved from the 1990s New York death metal scene, incorporating elements of hardcore punk. In contrast to other death metal styles, it is not generally focused on guitar solos and blast beats; instead, it employs mid-tempo rhythms, breakdowns, and palm-muted riffing, as well as hip hop-inspired vocal and drum beat rhythms. The breakdown riff of Suffocation&#x27;s &quot;Liege of Inveracity&quot; has been credited by Rolling Stone as the first slam riff in death metal. The first wave of bands in the genre were New York bands like Internal Bleeding and Pyrexia, with notable subsequent acts including Devourment and Cephalotripsy.

===Death-doom===
Death-doom is a style that combines the slow tempos and pessimistic atmosphere of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doom Metal Special: Doom/Death Terrorizer #142&quot;&gt;&quot;Doom Metal Special: Doom/Death&quot;, &quot;Terrorizer #142&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced mostly by the early work of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, the style emerged during the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s. Death-doom was also pioneered by bands such as Winter, Disembowelment, Paradise Lost, Autopsy, Anathema, and My Dying Bride.

====Funeral doom====

Funeral doom is a genre that crosses death-doom with funeral dirge music. It is played at a very slow tempo, and places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair. Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted and dark ambient aspects such as keyboards or synthesizers are often used to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background. Funeral doom was pioneered by Mournful Congregation (Australia), Esoteric (United Kingdom), Evoken (United States), Funeral (Norway), Thergothon (Finland), and Skepticism (Finland).

===Death &#x27;n&#x27; roll===

Death &#x27;n&#x27; roll is a style that combines death metal&#x27;s growled vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffs along with elements of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal. Notable examples include Entombed, Gorefest, and Six Feet Under.

===Deathcore=== 
Deathcore is a subgenre that merges the intensity of death metal with the aggressive elements of metalcore. It is characterized by fast drumming, including blast beats, down-tuned guitars, tremolo picking, growled vocals, high-pitched shrieks, and the breakdowns typical of metalcore. &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine noted that &quot;one of Suffocation&#x27;s trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.&quot; Dying Fetus was also influencing deathcore through their extensive use of slam riffs, breakdowns, and hardcore-inspired grooves. Their 1996 album &quot;Purification Through Violence&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Killing on Adrenaline&quot; introduced a mix of brutal death metal and hardcore elements that would later be adopted by deathcore bands. Early pioneers of deathcore include the Red Chord, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon, Ion Dissonance, Salt the Wound, Whitechapel, Job For A Cowboy, Carnifex, and the Acacia Strain. These bands combined the technicality of death metal with the breakdown-driven structures of metalcore, creating a distinct and influential sound.

===Deathgrind, goregrind and pornogrind===
Goregrind, deathgrind and pornogrind are styles that mix grindcore with death metal, with goregrind focused on themes like gore and forensic pathology, and pornogrind dealing with sexual and pornographic themes. Some notable examples of these genres are Brujeria, Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer, Circle of Dead Children, Rotten Sound, Gut, and Cock and Ball Torture.

===Deathrash===
Deathrash, also known as death-thrash, is a shorthand term to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and thrash metal. The genre gained notoriety in Bali, Indonesia, where it attracted criticism of being related to the accelerated tourism development on the island and the superseding of its local culture, particularly by Jakartan one. Notable bands include Grave, Mortification, The Crown, Incapacity, Darkane, Deathchain, and Sepultura.

===Industrial death metal===
Industrial death metal is a genre of death metal that adds elements of industrial music. Some notable bands include Fear Factory, Anaal Nathrakh, Autokrator, and Meathook Seed.

===Melodic death metal===
Swedish death metal could be considered the forerunner of &quot;melodic death metal.&quot; Melodic death metal, occasionally shortened to &quot;melodeath&quot;, is a fusion of heavy metal with elements of death metal. The subgenre is heavily influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal. Unlike most other death metal, melodeath usually features screams instead of growls, slower tempos, and much stronger emphasis on melody. Clean vocals may be used on occasion. Carcass is sometimes credited with releasing the first melodic death metal album with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Heartwork&quot;, although Swedish bands In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and At the Gates are usually mentioned as the main pioneers of the genre and of the Gothenburg metal sound.

===Old school death metal===
Old school death metal is a style of death metal that is characterized by slower tempos and simpler song structures.The style typically employs fewer blast beats and is less concerned with the technical aspects of songwriting. It gained prominence in the late 1990s, with bands like Repugnant, Thanatos, Necrophagia, Abscess, Bloodbath and Mortem.

===Symphonic death metal===
Symphonic death metal is a genre of death metal that adds elements of classical music. Bands described as symphonic death metal include Fleshgod Apocalypse, Septicflesh, Necronomicon, and Children of Bodom. Haggard&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Awaking the Centuries&quot;, has been described as death metal-styled symphonic metal.

===Technical death metal===
Technical death metal (also known as tech-death, progressive death metal, or prog-death) is a subgenre of death metal that employs dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of progressive rock, jazz or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. &quot;Tech death&quot; and &quot;prog death&quot;, for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as Nile, Edge of Sanity, and Opeth. Necrophagist and Spawn of Possession are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers Death also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. Some albums for this subgenre are &quot;Hallucinations&quot; (1990) by the German band Atrocity and Death&#x27;s &quot;Human&quot; (1991). This style has significantly influenced many bands, creating a stream that in Europe was carried out at first by bands such as Gory Blister and Electrocution. The Polish band Decapitated gained recognition as one of Europe&#x27;s primary modern technical death metal acts.

<text>&#x27;, the full title being The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes. It was originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615. Considered a founding work of Western literature, it is often said to be the first modern novel. The novel has been labelled by many well-known authors as the &quot;best book of all time&quot; and the &quot;best and most central work in world literature&quot;. &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is also one of the most-translated books in the world and one of the best-selling novels of all time.

The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, an hidalgo from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant () to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name . He recruits as his squire a simple farm labourer, Sancho Panza, who brings a unique, earthy wit to Don Quixote&#x27;s lofty rhetoric. In the first part of the book, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story meant for the annals of all time. However, as Salvador de Madariaga pointed out in his &quot;Guía del lector del Quijote&quot; (1972 [1926]), referring to &quot;the Sanchification of Don Quixote and the Quixotization of Sancho&quot;, as &quot;Sancho&#x27;s spirit ascends from reality to illusion, Don Quixote&#x27;s declines from illusion to reality&quot;.

The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844), and Edmond Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1897) as well as the word &quot;quixotic&quot;. Mark Twain referred to the book as having &quot;swept the world&#x27;s admiration for the mediaeval chivalry-silliness out of existence&quot;. It has been described by some as the greatest work ever written.

==Summary==

For Cervantes and the readers of his day, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; was a one-volume book published in 1605, divided internally into four parts, not the first part of a two-part set. The mention in the 1605 book of further adventures yet to be told was totally conventional, did not indicate any authorial plans for a continuation, and was not taken seriously by the book&#x27;s first readers.

===Part 1===
====The first sally====
Cervantes, in a metafictional narrative, writes that the first few chapters were taken from &quot;the archives of La Mancha&quot;, and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by the Moorish historian Cide Hamete Benengeli.

Alonso Quixano is a hidalgo nearing 50 years of age who lives in a deliberately unspecified region of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper. While he lives a frugal life, as an avid reader of chivalric romances, he is full of fantasies about chivalry. Eventually, he goes mad and decides to become a knight errant. So, he dons an old suit of armor, renames himself &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, names his old workhorse &quot;Rocinante&quot;, and designates Aldonza Lorenzo (a slaughterhouse worker with a famed hand for salting pork) his lady love, renaming her Dulcinea del Toboso.

As he travels in search of adventure, he arrives at an inn that he believes to be a castle, calls the prostitutes he meets there &quot;ladies&quot;, and demands that the innkeeper, whom he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. The innkeeper agrees. Quixote starts the night holding vigil at the inn&#x27;s horse trough, which Quixote imagines to be a chapel. He then becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. In a pretended ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.

Quixote encounters a servant named Andres who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master over disputed wages. Quixote orders the master to stop beating Andres and untie him and makes the master swear to treat Andres fairly. However, the beating is resumed, and redoubled, as soon as Quixote leaves.

Quixote then encounters traders from Toledo. He demands that they agree that Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world. One of them demands to see her picture so that he can decide for himself. Enraged, Quixote charges at them but his horse stumbles, causing him to fall. One of the traders beats up Quixote, who is left at the side of the road until a neighboring peasant brings him back home.

While Quixote lies unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish curate, and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. They seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Quixote that it was done by a wizard.

====The second sally====
Don Quixote asks his neighbour, the poor farm labourer Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship. Sancho agrees and they sneak away at dawn. Their adventures together begin with Quixote&#x27;s attack on some windmills which he believes to be ferocious giants. They next encounter two Benedictine friars and, nearby, an unrelated lady in a carriage. Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who are holding the lady captive, knocks one of them from his horse, and is challenged by an armed Basque travelling with the company. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those travelling with her to &quot;surrender&quot; to Quixote.

After a friendly encounter with some goatherds and a less friendly one with some Yanguesan porters driving Galician ponies, Quixote and Sancho return to the &quot;castle&quot; (inn), where a mix-up involving a servant girl&#x27;s romantic rendezvous with another guest results in a brawl. Quixote explains to Sancho that the castle is enchanted. They decide to leave, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed in the air by several mischievous guests at the inn before he manages to follow.

After further adventures involving a dead body, a barber&#x27;s basin that Quixote imagines as the legendary helmet of Mambrino, and a group of galley slaves, they wander into the Sierra Morena. There they encounter the dejected and mostly mad Cardenio, who relates his story. Quixote decides to imitate Cardenio and live like a hermit. He sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village. They make a plan to trick Quixote into coming home, recruiting Dorotea, a woman they discover in the forest, to pose as the Princess Micomicona, a damsel in distress.

The plan works and Quixote and the group return to the inn, though Quixote is now convinced, thanks to a lie told by Sancho when asked about the letter, that Dulcinea wants to see him. At the inn, several other plots intersect and are resolved. Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Quixote does battle with some wineskins which he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomicona&#x27;s kingdom. An officer of the Santa Hermandad arrives with a warrant for Quixote&#x27;s arrest for freeing the galley slaves, but the priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote&#x27;s insanity. The officer agrees and Quixote is locked in a cage which he is made to think is an enchantment. He has a learned conversation with a Toledo canon he encounters by chance on the road, in which the canon expresses his scorn for untruthful chivalric books, but Don Quixote defends them. The group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, before he is finally brought home.

The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote&#x27;s further adventures.

===Part 2===
Although the two parts are now published as a single work, &quot;Don Quixote, Part Two&quot; was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. In an early example of metafiction, Part Two indicates that several of its characters have read the first part of the novel and are thus familiar with the history and peculiarities of the two protagonists.

====The third sally====
Don Quixote and Sancho are on their way to El Toboso to meet Dulcinea, with Sancho aware that his story about Dulcinea was a complete fabrication. They reach the city at daybreak and decide to enter at nightfall. However, a bad omen frightens Quixote into retreat and they quickly leave. Sancho is instead sent out alone by Quixote to meet Dulcinea and act as a go-between. Sancho&#x27;s luck brings three peasant girls along the road and he quickly tells Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting and as beautiful as ever. Since Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho goes on to pretend that an enchantment of some sort is at work.

A duke and duchess encounter the duo. These nobles have read Part One of the story and are themselves very fond of books of chivalry. They decide to play along for their own amusement, beginning a string of imagined adventures and practical jokes. As part of one prank, Quixote and Sancho are led to believe that the only way to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke&#x27;s patronage, Sancho eventually gets his promised governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler before all ends in humiliation. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.

Quixote battles the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Quixote&#x27;s hometown who had earlier posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in Barcelona. Defeated, Quixote submits to prearranged chivalric terms: the vanquished must obey the will of the conqueror. He is ordered to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for a period of one year, by which time his friends and relatives hope he will be cured.

On the way back home, Quixote and Sancho &quot;resolve&quot; the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Upon returning to his village, Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully become Alonso Quixano once more. Sancho tries to restore his faith and his interest in Dulcinea, but Quixano only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry.

After Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.

===Other stories===

&quot;Don Quixote, Part One&quot; contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the picaresque figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is &quot;El Curioso Impertinente&quot; (&quot;The Ill-Advised Curiosity&quot;), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a Florentine nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife&#x27;s fidelity and talks his close friend Lothario into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.

In &quot;Part Two&quot;, the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in &quot;Part One&quot; and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, &quot;Part Two&quot; contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.

Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.

====&quot;The Ill-Advised Curiosity&quot; summary====
The story within a story relates that, for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates; an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.

One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla&#x27;s house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla&#x27;s maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: When Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.

Later, the maid&#x27;s lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen, and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife&#x27;s affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish. Lothario is killed in battle soon afterward and Camilla dies of grief.

==Style and interpretations==
===Use of language===
The novel&#x27;s farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names &quot;Rocinante&quot; (a reversal) and &quot;Dulcinea&quot; (an allusion to illusion), and the word itself, possibly a pun on (jaw) but certainly (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse&#x27;s rump.

As a military term, the word &quot;quijote&quot; refers to &quot;cuisses&quot;, part of a full suit of plate armour protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix &quot;-ote&quot; denotes the augmentative—for example, &quot;grande&quot; means large, but &quot;grandote&quot; means extra large, with grotesque connotations. Following this example, &quot;Quixote&quot; would suggest &#x27;The Great Quijano&#x27;, an oxymoronic play on words that makes much sense in light of the character&#x27;s delusions of grandeur.

Cervantes wrote his work in Early Modern Spanish, heavily borrowing from Old Spanish, the medieval form of the language. The language of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, although still containing archaisms, is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the &quot;Poema de mio Cid&quot;, a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes&#x27; language as Middle English is from Modern English. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.

In &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource—he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him mad; and many times when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearean English, or even Middle English.)

In Old Castilian, the letter &quot;x&quot; represented the sound written &quot;sh&quot; in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced . However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, a sound change caused it to be pronounced with a voiceless velar fricative sound (like the Scots or German &quot;ch&quot;), and today the Spanish pronunciation of &quot;Quixote&quot; is . The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as Asturian, Leonese, Galician, Catalan, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish and French, where it is pronounced with a &quot;sh&quot; or &quot;ch&quot; sound; the French opera &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; is one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.

Today, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation of &quot;Quixote&quot; (&quot;Quijote&quot;), as , although the traditional English spelling-based pronunciation with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in or . In Australian English, the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to &quot;anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly&quot;. The traditional English rendering is preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival form &quot;quixotic&quot;, i.e., , defined by &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; as the foolishly impractical pursuit of ideals, typically marked by rash and lofty romanticism.

===Meaning===
Harold Bloom says &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war with Freud&#x27;s reality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying. Bloom says that the novel has an endless range of meanings, but that a recurring theme is the human need to withstand suffering.

Edith Grossman, who wrote and published a highly acclaimed English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I&#x27;m going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.

===Themes===

The novel&#x27;s structure is episodic in form. The full title is indicative of the tale&#x27;s object, as (Spanish) means &quot;quick with inventiveness&quot;, marking the transition of modern literature from dramatic to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.

Although burlesque on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by Pablo Picasso and Richard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book&#x27;s publication, and Don Quixote&#x27;s imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.

Even faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of orthodoxy, veracity and even nationalism. In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped lead literary practice beyond the narrow convention of the chivalric romance. He spoofs the chivalric romance through a straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the knightly virtues of the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word &quot;quixotic&quot; was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote&#x27;s steed, Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase &quot;tilting at windmills&quot; to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.

It stands in a unique position between medieval romance and the modern novel. The former consists of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through &quot;having read his adventures&quot;, and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more &quot;Alonso Quixano the Good&quot;.

==Background==
The cave of Medrano (also known as the &quot;casa de Medrano&quot;) in Argamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Miguel de Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write his famous work &quot;&quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;.&quot;

===Sources===
Sources for &quot;Don Quixote&quot; include the Castilian novel &quot;Amadis de Gaula&quot;, which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, which the priest describes in Chapter VI of &quot;Quixote&quot; as &quot;the best book in the world.&quot; (However, the sense in which it was &quot;best&quot; is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called &quot;the most difficult passage of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;&quot;.) The scene of the book burning provides a list of Cervantes&#x27;s likes and dislikes about literature.

Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem &quot;Orlando furioso&quot;. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of Mambrino, an episode from Canto I of &quot;Orlando&quot;, and itself a reference to Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot;. The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of &quot;Orlando&quot;, regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.

Another important source appears to have been Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale &quot;The Curious Impertinent&quot; in chapter 35 of the first part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius&#x27;s novel are fundamental to Cervantes&#x27; program. Similarly, many of both Sancho&#x27;s adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.

Cervantes&#x27; experiences as a galley slave in Algiers also influenced &quot;Quixote&quot;.

Medical theories may have also influenced Cervantes&#x27; literary process. Cervantes had familial ties to the distinguished medical community. His father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, and his great-grandfather, Juan Díaz de Torreblanca, were surgeons. Additionally, his sister, Andrea de Cervantes, was a nurse. He also befriended many individuals involved in the medical field, in that he knew medical author Francisco Díaz, an expert in urology, and royal doctor Antonio Ponce de Santa Cruz who served as a personal doctor to both Philip III and Philip IV of Spain.

Apart from the personal relations Cervantes maintained within the medical field, Cervantes&#x27; personal life was defined by an interest in medicine. He frequently visited patients from the Hospital de Inocentes in Sevilla. Furthermore, Cervantes explored medicine in his personal library. His library contained more than 200 volumes and included books like &quot;Examen de Ingenios&quot;, by Juan Huarte and &quot;Practica y teórica de cirugía&quot;, by Dionisio Daza Chacón that defined medical literature and medical theories of his time.

Researchers Isabel Sanchez Duque and Francisco Javier Escudero have found that Cervantes was a friend of the family Villaseñor, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acuña. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road from El Toboso to Miguel Esteban in 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of &quot;hidalgo&quot;, and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.

===Spurious &quot;Second Part&quot; by Avellaneda===
It is not certain when Cervantes began writing &quot;Part Two&quot; of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. In about September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled &quot;Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, of Tordesillas&quot;, was published in Tarragona by an unidentified Aragonese who was an admirer of Lope de Vega, rival of Cervantes. It was translated into English by William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.

Some modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote&#x27;s fictional encounter with Avellaneda&#x27;s book in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that Cervantes encountered it, which may have been much earlier.

Avellaneda&#x27;s identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Segunda Parte&quot; lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda&#x27;s own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.

In his introduction to &quot;The Portable Cervantes&quot;, Samuel Putnam, a noted translator of Cervantes&#x27; novel, calls Avellaneda&#x27;s version &quot;one of the most disgraceful performances in history&quot;.

The second part of Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Segunda Parte&quot;, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda&#x27;s &quot;Second Part&quot; being printed there, in an early example of metafiction. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza also meet one of the characters from Avellaneda&#x27;s book, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and make him swear that the &quot;other&quot; Quixote and Sancho are impostors.

===Setting===
====Location====

Cervantes&#x27; story takes place on the plains of La Mancha, specifically the &quot;comarca&quot; of Campo de Montiel.

The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; has been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:

In 2004, a team of academics from Complutense University, led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fernández Nieto, and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of Villanueva de los Infantes. Their findings were published in a paper titled &quot;&#x27;El Quijote&#x27; como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localización del lugar de la Mancha&quot;, which was later published as a book: &quot;El enigma resuelto del Quijote&quot;. The result was replicated in two subsequent investigations: &quot;La determinación del lugar de la Mancha como problema estadístico&quot; and &quot;The Kinematics of the Quixote and the Identity of the &#x27;Place in La Mancha&#x27;&quot;.

Translators of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, such as John Ormsby, have commented that the region of La Mancha is one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.

On the other hand, as Borges points out:
The story also takes place in El Toboso where Don Quixote goes to seek Dulcinea&#x27;s blessings.

==== Historical context ====
&quot;Don Quixote&quot; is said to reflect the Spanish society in which Cervantes lived and wrote. Spain&#x27;s status as a world power was declining, and the Spanish national treasury was bankrupt due to expensive foreign wars. Spanish cultural dominance was also waning as the Protestant Reformation had put the Spanish Roman Catholic Church on the defensive, which had led to the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition. Meanwhile, the &quot;hidalgo&quot; class was losing relevance because of changes in Spanish society which made the high ideals of chivalry obsolete.

==Legacy==

===Influence on modern Spanish===
In 2002 the Norwegian Nobel Institute conducted a study among writers from 55 countries, the majority voted &quot;Don Quixote&quot; &quot;the greatest work of fiction ever written&quot;.

The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish cliché with the phrase (&quot;whose name I do not wish to recall&quot;): (&quot;In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.&quot;)

===Influence on the English language===
&quot;Don Quixote&quot; alongside its many translations, has also provided a number of idioms and expressions to the English language. Examples with their own articles include the phrase &quot;the pot calling the kettle black&quot; and the adjective &quot;quixotic.&quot;

==== Tilting at windmills ====

Tilting at windmills is an English idiom that means &quot;attacking imaginary enemies&quot;. The expression is derived from &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and the word &quot;tilt&quot; in this context refers to jousting. This phrase is sometimes also expressed as &quot;charging at windmills&quot; or &quot;fighting the windmills&quot;.

The phrase is sometimes used to describe either confrontations where adversaries are incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications. It may also connote an inopportune, unfounded, and vain effort against adversaries real or imagined.

Dulcibella, a deep-sea amphipod species, was named after the novel, following the tradition of naming amphipods after literary figures.

==Publication==


In July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights of &quot;El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha&quot; (known as &quot;Don Quixote, Part I&quot;) to the publisher-bookseller Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum. License to publish was granted in September, the printing was finished in December, and the book came out on 16 January 1605.

The novel was an immediate success. Most of the 400 copies of the first edition were sent to the New World, with the publisher hoping to get a better price in the Americas. Although most of them disappeared in a shipwreck near La Havana, approximately 70 copies reached Lima, from where they were sent to Cuzco, in the heart of the defunct Inca Empire.

No sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue derivative (pirated) editions. In 1614 a fake second part was published by a mysterious author under the pen name Avellaneda. This author was never satisfactorily identified. This rushed Cervantes into writing and publishing a genuine second part in 1615, which was a year before his own death. &quot;Don Quixote&quot; had been growing in favour, and its author&#x27;s name was now known beyond the Pyrenees. By August 1605, there were two Madrid editions, two published in Lisbon, and one in Valencia. Publisher Francisco de Robles secured additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal for a second edition.

Sale of these publishing rights deprived Cervantes of further financial profit on &quot;Part One&quot;. In 1607, an edition was printed in Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610. Yet another Brussels edition was called for in 1611. Since then, numerous editions have been released and in total, the novel is believed to have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide. The work has been produced in numerous editions and languages, the Cervantes Collection, at the State Library of New South Wales includes over 1,100 editions. These were collected, by Ben Haneman, over a period of thirty years.

In 1613, Cervantes published the &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot;, dedicated to the Maecenas of the day, the Conde de Lemos. Eight and a half years after &quot;Part One&quot; had appeared came the first hint of a forthcoming &quot;Segunda Parte&quot; (Part Two). &quot;You shall see shortly&quot;, Cervantes says, &quot;the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.&quot; &quot;Don Quixote, Part Two&quot;, published by the same press as its predecessor, appeared late in 1615, and quickly reprinted in Brussels and Valencia (1616) and Lisbon (1617). Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes&#x27; work has been said to have &quot;smiled Spain&#x27;s chivalry away&quot;, suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.

===English editions in translation===
There are many translations of the book, and it has been adapted many times in shortened versions. Many derivative editions were also written at the time, as was the custom of envious or unscrupulous writers. Seven years after the &quot;Parte Primera&quot; appeared, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; had been translated into French, German, Italian, and English, with the first French translation of &#x27;Part II&#x27; appearing in 1618, and the first English translation in 1620. One abridged adaptation, authored by Agustín Sánchez, runs slightly over 150 pages, cutting away about 750 pages.

Thomas Shelton&#x27;s English translation of the &quot;First Part&quot; appeared in 1612 while Cervantes was still alive, although there is no evidence that Shelton had met the author. Although Shelton&#x27;s version is cherished by some, according to John Ormsby and Samuel Putnam, it was far from satisfactory as a carrying over of Cervantes&#x27; text. Shelton&#x27;s translation of the novel&#x27;s &quot;Second Part&quot; appeared in 1620.

Near the end of the 17th century, John Phillips, a nephew of poet John Milton, published what Putnam considered the worst English translation. The translation, as literary critics claim, was not based on Cervantes&#x27; text but mostly on a French work by Filleau de Saint-Martin and on notes which Thomas Shelton had written.

Around 1700, a version by Pierre Antoine Motteux appeared. Motteux&#x27;s translation enjoyed lasting popularity; it was reprinted as the Modern Library Series edition of the novel until recent times. Nonetheless, future translators would find much to fault in Motteux&#x27;s version: Samuel Putnam criticized &quot;the prevailing slapstick quality of this work, especially where Sancho Panza is involved, the obtrusion of the obscene where it is found in the original, and the slurring of difficulties through omissions or expanding upon the text&quot;. John Ormsby considered Motteux&#x27;s version &quot;worse than worthless&quot;, and denounced its &quot;infusion of Cockney flippancy and facetiousness&quot; into the original.

The proverb &quot;The proof of the pudding is in the eating&quot; is widely attributed to Cervantes. The Spanish word for pudding (), however, does not appear in the original text but premieres in the Motteux translation. In Smollett&#x27;s translation of 1755 he notes that the original text reads literally &quot;you will see when the eggs are fried&quot;, meaning &quot;time will tell&quot;.

A translation by Captain John Stevens, which revised Thomas Shelton&#x27;s version, also appeared in 1700, but its publication was overshadowed by the simultaneous release of Motteux&#x27;s translation.

In 1742, the Charles Jervas translation appeared, posthumously. Through a printer&#x27;s error, it came to be known, and is still known, as &quot;the Jarvis translation&quot;. It was the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time, but future translator John Ormsby points out in his own introduction to the novel that the Jarvis translation has been criticized as being too stiff. Nevertheless, it became the most frequently reprinted translation of the novel until about 1885. Another 18th-century translation into English was that of Tobias Smollett, himself a novelist, first published in 1755. Like the Jarvis translation, it continues to be reprinted today.

A translation by Alexander James Duffield appeared in 1881 and another by Henry Edward Watts in 1888. Most modern translators take as their model the 1885 translation by John Ormsby.

An expurgated children&#x27;s version, under the title &quot;The Story of Don Quixote&quot;, was published in 1922 (available on Project Gutenberg). It leaves out the risqué sections as well as chapters that young readers might consider dull, and embellishes a great deal on Cervantes&#x27; original text. The title page actually gives credit to the two editors as if they were the authors, and omits any mention of Cervantes.

The most widely read English-language translations of the mid-20th century are by Samuel Putnam (1949), J. M. Cohen (1950; Penguin Classics), and Walter Starkie (1957). The last English translation of the novel in the 20th century was by Burton Raffel, published in 1996. The 21st century has already seen five new translations of the novel into English. The first is by John D. Rutherford and the second by Edith Grossman. Reviewing the novel in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Carlos Fuentes called Grossman&#x27;s translation a &quot;major literary achievement&quot; and another called it the &quot;most transparent and least impeded among more than a dozen English translations going back to the 17th century.&quot;

In 2005, the year of the novel&#x27;s 400th anniversary, Tom Lathrop published a new English translation of the novel, based on a lifetime of specialized study of the novel and its history. The fourth translation of the 21st century was released in 2006 by former university librarian James H. Montgomery, 26 years after he had begun it, in an attempt to &quot;recreate the sense of the original as closely as possible, though not at the expense of Cervantes&#x27; literary style.&quot;

In 2011, another translation by Gerald J. Davis appeared, which is self-published via Lulu.com. The latest and the sixth translation of the 21st century is Diana de Armas Wilson&#x27;s 2020 revision of Burton Raffel&#x27;s translation.

<doc id="8240" wikidata="Q6034" url="?curid=8240" title="Dada">
<text>Dada () or Dadaism was an anti-establishment art movement that developed in 1915 in the context of the Great War and the earlier anti-art movement. Early centers for dadaism included Zürich and Berlin. Within a few years, the movement had spread to New York City and a variety of artistic centers in Europe and Asia. 
Within the umbrella of the movement, people used a wide variety of artistic forms to protest the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalism and modern war. To develop their protest, artists tended to make use of nonsense, irrationality, and an anti-bourgeois sensibility. The art of the movement began primarily as performance art, but eventually spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism and maintained political affinities with radical politics on the left-wing and far-left politics. The movement had no shared artistic style, although most artists had shown interest in the machine aesthetic.

There is no consensus on the origin of the movement&#x27;s name; a common story is that the artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife randomly into a dictionary, where it landed on &quot;dada&quot;, a French term for a hobby horse. Others note it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate it might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement&#x27;s internationalism.

The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement&#x27;s detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian Futurists, and German Expressionists would influence Dada&#x27;s rejection of the correlation between words and meaning. Works such as &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet &quot;Parade&quot; (1916–17) by Erik Satie would be characterized as proto-Dadaist works. The Dada movement&#x27;s principles were first collected in Hugo Ball&#x27;s Dada Manifesto in 1916. Ball is seen as the founder of the Dada movement.

The Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art and literary journals. Passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included Jean Arp, Johannes Baader, Hugo Ball, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, George Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, Emmy Hennings, Hannah Höch, Richard Huelsenbeck, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Hans Richter, Kurt Schwitters, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Tristan Tzara, and Beatrice Wood, among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including Surrealism, &quot;nouveau réalisme&quot;, pop art, and Fluxus.

==Overview==

Dada was an informal international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada correspond with the outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.

Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments. They had seen (or participated in) Cubist exhibitions held at Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona (1912), Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin (1912), the Armory Show in New York (1913), SVU Mánes in Prague (1914), several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at Moderne Kunstkring, Amsterdam (between 1911 and 1915). Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists. Dada subsequently combined these approaches.

Many Dadaists believed that the &#x27;reason&#x27; and &#x27;logic&#x27; of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war. They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality. For example, George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest &quot;against this world of mutual destruction&quot;.

According to Hans Richter Dada was not art: it was &quot;anti-art&quot;. Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for. Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics, Dada ignored aesthetics. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.

Additionally, Dada attempted to reflect onto human perception and the chaotic nature of society. Tristan Tzara proclaimed, &quot;Everything is Dada, too. Beware of Dada. Anti-dadaism is a disease: selfkleptomania, man&#x27;s normal condition, is Dada. But the real Dadas are against Dada&quot;.

As Hugo Ball expressed it, &quot;For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in.&quot;

A reviewer from the &quot;American Art News&quot; stated at the time that &quot;Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man.&quot; Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a &quot;reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide&quot;.

Years later, Dada artists described the movement as &quot;a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege.&quot;

To quote Dona Budd&#x27;s &quot;The Language of Art Knowledge&quot;, Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara&#x27;s and Marcel Janco&#x27;s frequent use of the words &quot;da, da,&quot; meaning &quot;yes, yes&quot; in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name &quot;Dada&quot; came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French–German dictionary happened to point to &#x27;dada&#x27;, a French word for &#x27;hobbyhorse&#x27;. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestos, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works.

The creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and &quot;New York Dada&quot; came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:

Ironically, though, Duchamp&#x27;s late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada&#x27;s history. Dada&#x27;s European chroniclers—primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck—would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zürich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.

==History==
Dada emerged from a period of artistic and literary movements like Futurism, Cubism and Expressionism; centered mainly in Italy, France and Germany respectively, in those years. However, unlike the earlier movements Dada was able to establish a broad base of support, giving rise to a movement that was international in scope. Its adherents were based in cities all over the world including New York, Zürich, Berlin, Paris and others. There were regional differences like an emphasis on literature in Zürich and political protest in Berlin.

Prominent Dadaists published manifestos, but the movement was loosely organized and there was no central hierarchy. On 14 July 1916, Ball originated the seminal Dada Manifesto. Tzara wrote a second Dada manifesto, considered important Dada reading, which was published in 1918. Tzara&#x27;s manifesto articulated the concept of &quot;Dadaist disgust&quot;—the contradiction implicit in avant-garde works between the criticism and affirmation of modernist reality. In the Dadaist perspective modern art and culture are considered a type of fetishization where the objects of consumption (including organized systems of thought like philosophy and morality) are chosen, much like a preference for cake or cherries, to fill a void.

The shock and scandal the movement inflamed was deliberate; Dadaist magazines were banned and their exhibits closed. Some of the artists even faced imprisonment. These provocations were part of the entertainment but, over time, audiences&#x27; expectations eventually outpaced the movement&#x27;s capacity to deliver. As the artists&#x27; well-known &quot;sarcastic laugh&quot; started to come from the audience, the provocations of Dadaists began to lose their impact. Dada was an active movement during years of political turmoil from 1916 when European countries were actively engaged in World War I, the conclusion of which, in 1918, set the stage for a new political order.

===Zürich===
There is some disagreement about where Dada originated. The movement is commonly accepted by most art historians and those who lived during this period to have identified with the Cabaret Voltaire (housed inside the &quot;Holländische Meierei&quot; bar in Zürich) co-founded by poet and cabaret singer Emmy Hennings and Hugo Ball. Some sources propose a Romanian origin, arguing that Dada was an offshoot of a vibrant artistic tradition that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish modernist artists, including Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco, and Arthur Segal settled in Zürich. Before World War I, similar art had already existed in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada&#x27;s catalyst was the arrival in Zürich of artists like Tzara and Janco.

The name &quot;Cabaret Voltaire&quot; was a reference to the French philosopher Voltaire, whose novel &quot;Candide&quot; mocked the religious and philosophical dogmas of the day. Opening night was attended by Ball, Tzara, Jean Arp, and Janco. These artists along with others like Sophie Taeuber, Richard Huelsenbeck and Hans Richter started putting on performances at the Cabaret Voltaire and using art to express their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.

Having left Germany and Romania during World War I, the artists arrived in politically neutral Switzerland. They used abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. They used shock art, provocation, and &quot;vaudevillian excess&quot; to subvert the conventions they believed had caused the Great War. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society that was so apathetic it would wage war against itself rather than challenge the &quot;status quo&quot;:

Ball said that Janco&#x27;s mask and costume designs, inspired by Romanian folk art, made &quot;the horror of our time, the paralyzing background of events&quot; visible. According to Ball, performances were accompanied by a &quot;balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs.&quot; Often influenced by African music, arrhythmic drumming and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.

After the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and Hugo Ball left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.

Zürich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review &quot;Dada&quot; beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Zürich and the final two from Paris.

Other artists, such as André Breton and Philippe Soupault, created &quot;literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada&quot;.

After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918, most of the Zürich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities. Others, such as the Swiss native Sophie Taeuber, would remain in Zürich into the 1920s.

===Berlin===
&quot;Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men&#x27;s minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody&#x27;s bones&quot; – Richard Hülsenbeck

Raoul Hausmann, who helped establish Dada in Berlin, published his manifesto &quot;Synthethic Cino of Painting&quot; in 1918 where he attacked Expressionism and the art critics who promoted it. Dada is envisioned in contrast to art forms, such as Expressionism, that appeal to viewers&#x27; emotional states: &quot;the exploitation of so-called echoes of the soul&quot;. In Hausmann&#x27;s conception of Dada, new techniques of creating art would open doors to explore new artistic impulses. Fragmented use of real world stimuli allowed an expression of reality that was radically different from other forms of art:
The groups in Germany were not as strongly anti-art as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive manifestos and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York&#x27;s geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically driven, less political nature. According to Hans Richter, a Dadaist who was in Berlin yet &quot;aloof from active participation in Berlin Dada&quot;, several distinguishing characteristics of the Dada movement there included: &quot;its political element and its technical discoveries in painting and literature&quot;; &quot;inexhaustible energy&quot;; &quot;mental freedom which included the abolition of everything&quot;; and &quot;members intoxicated with their own power in a way that had no relation to the real world&quot;, who would &quot;turn their rebelliousness even against each other&quot;.

In February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the October Revolution in Russia, by then out of the war, Hannah Höch and George Grosz used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with John Heartfield, Höch and Hausmann developed the of photomontage during this period. Johannes Baader, the uninhibited Oberdada, was the &quot;crowbar&quot; of the Berlin movement&#x27;s direct action according to Hans Richter and is credited with creating the first giant collages, according to Raoul Hausmann.

After the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the First International Dada Fair, &#x27;the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists&#x27;, in the summer of 1920. As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada (Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch, Johannes Baader, Huelsenbeck and Heartfield), the exhibition also included the work of Otto Dix, Francis Picabia, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Rudolf Schlichter, Johannes Baargeld and others. In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi&#x27;s &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot; exhibition in 1937. Despite high ticket prices, the exhibition lost money, with only one recorded sale.

The Berlin group published periodicals such as &quot;Club Dada&quot;, &quot;Der Dada&quot;, &quot;Everyman His Own Football&quot;, and &quot;Dada Almanach&quot;. They also established a political party, the Central Council of Dada for the World Revolution.

===Cologne===
In Cologne, Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Cologne&#x27;s Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a communion dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.

===New York===


Like Zürich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia met American artist Man Ray. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical anti-art activities in the United States. American Beatrice Wood, who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. Arthur Cravan, fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in Alfred Stieglitz&#x27;s gallery, 291, and the home of Walter and Louise Arensberg.

The New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities &quot;Dada,&quot; but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as &quot;The Blind Man&quot;, &quot;Rongwrong&quot;, and &quot;New York Dada&quot; in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for &quot;museum&quot; art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book &quot;Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets&quot; Marsden Hartley included an essay on &quot;&quot;.

During this time Duchamp began exhibiting &quot;readymades&quot; (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the Society of Independent Artists. In 1917 he submitted the now famous &quot;Fountain&quot;, a urinal signed R. Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the &quot;Fountain&quot; has since become almost canonized by some as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture. Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 Turner Prize, Gordon&#x27;s gin, voted it &quot;the most influential work of modern art&quot;.

As recent scholarship documents, the work is still controversial. Duchamp indicated in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work: &quot;One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.&quot; The piece is in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp&#x27;s neighbour, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. In an attempt to &quot;pay homage to the spirit of Dada&quot; a performance artist named Pierre Pinoncelli made a crack in a replica of &quot;The Fountain&quot; with a hammer in January 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.

Picabia&#x27;s travels tied New York, Zürich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical &quot;391&quot; in Barcelona, New York City, Zürich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.

By 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.

===Paris===

The French avant-garde kept abreast of Dada activities in Zürich with regular communications from Tristan Tzara (whose pseudonym means &quot;sad in country,&quot; a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with Guillaume Apollinaire, André Breton, Max Jacob, Clément Pansaers, and other French writers, critics and artists.

Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, Erik Satie, collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad, scandalous ballet called &quot;Parade&quot;. First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.

Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of &quot;Dada&quot;, &quot;Le Cannibale&quot;, and &quot;Littérature&quot; featured Dada in several editions.)

The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the &quot;Salon des Indépendants&quot; in 1921. Jean Crotti exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, &quot;Explicatif&quot; bearing the word &quot;Tabu&quot;. In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play &quot;The Gas Heart&quot; to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by André Breton) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce Surrealism. Tzara&#x27;s last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his &quot;ironic tragedy&quot; &quot;Handkerchief of Clouds&quot; in 1924.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the Dada movement centered mainly around Theo van Doesburg, best known for establishing the &quot;De Stijl&quot; movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in &quot;De Stijl&quot; such as Hugo Ball, Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters. Van Doesburg and (a cordwainer and artist in Drachten) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called &quot;Dutch Dada campaign&quot; in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled &quot;What is Dada?&quot;), Schwitters read his poems, Vilmos Huszár demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo&#x27;s wife), played avant-garde compositions on piano.
Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in &quot;De Stijl&quot;, although under a pseudonym, I.K. Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. &#x27;Together&#x27; with I.K. Bonset, he also published a short-lived Dutch Dada magazine called &quot;Mécano&quot; (1922–23). Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H. N. Werkman, who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, &quot;The Next Call&quot; (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and Paul Citroen.

===Georgia===
Though Dada itself was unknown in Georgia until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves Le Degré 41&quot;, or &quot;Le Degré Quarante et Un&quot; (English, &quot;The 41st Degree&quot;) (referring both to the latitude of Tbilisi, Georgia and to the Celsius temperature of a high fever [equal to 105.8 Fahrenheit]) organized along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was Iliazd (Ilia Zdanevich), whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists.

After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events. For example, when Tristan Tzara was banned from holding seminars in Théâtre Michel in 1923, Iliazd booked the venue on his behalf for the performance, &quot;The Bearded Heart Soirée&quot;, and designed the flyer.

===Yugoslavia===
In Yugoslavia, alongside the new art movement Zenitism, there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by Dragan Aleksić and including work by Mihailo S. Petrov, Ljubomir Micić and Branko Ve Poljanski. Aleksić used the term &quot;Yougo-Dada&quot; and is known to have been in contact with Raoul Hausmann, Kurt Schwitters, and Tristan Tzara.

===Italy===
The Dada movement in Italy, based in Mantua, was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art. It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as &quot;True Dada is against Dada&quot;. One member of this group was Julius Evola, who went on to become an eminent scholar of occultism, as well as a right-wing philosopher.

===Japan===
A prominent Dada group in Japan was Mavo. The group was founded in July 1923 by Tomoyoshi Murayama and Yanase Masamu; they were later joined by Tatsuo Okada. Other prominent artists were Jun Tsuji, Eisuke Yoshiyuki, Shinkichi Takahashi and Katué Kitasono.
In Tsuburaya Productions&#x27;s &quot;Ultra Series&quot;, an alien named Dada was inspired by the Dadaism movement, with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 tokusatsu series, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, its design by character artist Toru Narita. Dada&#x27;s design is primarily monochromatic, and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes, in reference to the movement and, in particular, to chessboard and Go patterns. On May 19, 2016, in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo, the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher.

Butoh, the Japanese dance-form originating in 1959, can be considered to have direct connections to the spirit of the Dada movement, as Tatsumi Hijikata, one of Butoh&#x27;s founders, &quot;was influenced early in his career by Dadaism&quot;.

===Russia===
Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia; however, avant-garde art was widespread due to the Bolsheviks&#x27; revolutionary agenda. The , a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that Vladimir Mayakovsky should go to the &quot;Pampushka&quot; (Pameatnik Pushkina – Pushkin monument) on the &quot;Tverbul&quot; (Tverskoy Boulevard) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it, after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature. For more information on Dadaism&#x27;s influence upon Russian avant-garde art, see the book &quot;Russian Dada 1914–1924&quot;.

==Women of Dada==
The vital contributions of female artists to the Dada movement were often reduced to their personal relationships with male Dadaists, and thus they were not written about as extensively in their own right. Notable mentions other than the artists below include: Suzanne Duchamp, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Emmy Hennings, Beatrice Wood, Clara Tice, and Ella Bergmann-Michel.

===Hannah Höch===
Hannah Höch of Berlin is considered to be the only female Dadaist in Berlin at the time of the movement. During this time, she was in a relationship with Raoul Hausmann who also was a Dada artist. She channeled the same anti-war and anti-government (Weimar Republic) in her works but brought out a feminist lens on the themes. With her works primarily of collage and photomontage, she often used precise placement or detailed titles to callout the misogynistic ways she and other women were treated.

===Sophie Taeuber-Arp===
Sophie Taeuber-Arp was a Swiss artist, teacher, and dancer who produced various types of fine art and handicraft pieces. While married to Dadaist Jean Arp, Taeuber-Arp was known in the Dada community for her performative dancing. As such, she worked with choreographer Rudolf von Laban and was written by Tristan Tzara for her dancing skills.

===Mina Loy===
London-born Mina Loy was known for being active in the literary sector of the New York Dada scene. She spent time writing poetry, creating Dada magazines, and acting and writing in plays. She contributed writing to Dada journal &quot;The Blind Man&quot; and Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Rongwrong&quot;.

==Poetry==
Dadaists used shock, nihilism, negativity, paradox, randomness, subconscious forces, anti-poetry and antinomianism to subvert established traditions in the aftermath of the Great War. Tzara&#x27;s 1920 manifesto proposed cutting words from a newspaper and randomly selecting fragments to write poetry, a process in which the synchronous universe itself becomes an active agent in creating the art. A poem written using this technique would be a &quot;fruit&quot; of the words that were clipped from the article.

In literary arts, Dadaists focused on poetry, particularly the so-called sound poetry invented by Hugo Ball. Dadaist poems attacked traditional conceptions of poetry, including structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and the meaning of language. For Dadaists, the existing system by which information is articulated robs language of its dignity. The dismantling of language and poetic conventions are Dadaist attempts to restore language to its purest and most innocent form: &quot;With these sound poem, we wanted to dispense with a language which journalism had made desolate and impossible.&quot;

Simultaneous poems (or &quot;poèmes simultanés&quot;) were recited by a group of speakers who, collectively, produced a chaotic and confusing set of voices. These poems are considered manifestations of modernity including advertising, technology, and conflict. Unlike movements such as Expressionism, Dadaism did not take a negative view of modernity and the urban life. The chaotic urban and futuristic world is considered natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art.

==Music==
Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. These movements exerted a pervasive influence on 20th-century music, especially on mid-century avant-garde composers based in New York—among them Edgard Varèse, Stefan Wolpe, John Cage, and Morton Feldman. Kurt Schwitters developed what he called &quot;sound poems&quot;, while Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as Erwin Schulhoff, Hans Heusser and Alberto Savinio all wrote &quot;Dada music&quot;, while members of Les Six collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. Erik Satie also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career.

==Legacy==
While broadly based, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, social realism and other forms of modernism. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of postmodern art.

By the dawn of the Second World War, many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some (Otto Freundlich, Walter Serner) died in death camps under Adolf Hitler, who actively persecuted the kind of &quot;degenerate art&quot; that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.

Dada is a named influence and reference of various anti-art and political and cultural movements, including the Situationist International and culture jamming groups like the Cacophony Society. Upon breaking up in July 2012, anarchist pop band Chumbawamba issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.

At the same time that the Zürich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the Cabaret Voltaire, Lenin was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. Tom Stoppard used this coincidence as a premise for his play &quot;Travesties&quot; (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and James Joyce as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek &quot;Lénine Dada&quot; (1989).

The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves Neo-Dadaists, led by Mark Divo. The group included Jan Thieler, Ingo Giezendanner, Aiana Calugar, Lennie Lee, and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.

Several notable retrospectives have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The LTM label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.

Musician Frank Zappa was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:In the early days, I didn&#x27;t even know what to call the stuff my life was made of. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea—AND a nice, short name for it.David Bowie adapted William S. Burroughs&#x27; cut-up technique for writing lyrics and Kurt Cobain also admittedly used this method for many of his Nirvana lyrics, including &quot;In Bloom&quot;.

==Art techniques developed==
Dadaism also blurred the line between literary and visual arts:

Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to postmodernism, an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for Surrealism.

===Collage===
The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life. They also invented the &quot;chance collage&quot; technique, involving dropping torn scraps of paper onto a larger sheet and then pasting the pieces wherever they landed.

===Cut-up technique===
Cut-up technique is an extension of collage to words themselves, Tristan Tzara describes this in the Dada Manifesto:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM
Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
And there you are – an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Photomontage===
The Dadaists – the &quot;monteurs&quot; (mechanics) – used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, Max Ernst used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war. Although the Berlin photomontages were assembled, like engines, the (non)relationships among the disparate elements were more rhetorical than real.

===Assemblage===
The assemblages were three-dimensional variations of the collage – the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions. Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall.

===Readymades===
Marcel Duchamp began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called &quot;readymades&quot;. He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called &quot;readymade aided&quot; or &quot;rectified readymades&quot;. Duchamp wrote: &quot;One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the &#x27;readymade.&#x27; That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called &#x27;readymade aided. One such example of Duchamp&#x27;s readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed &quot;R. Mutt&quot;, titled &quot;Fountain&quot;, and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.

Many young artists in America embraced the theories and ideas espoused by Duchamp. Robert Rauschenberg in particular was very influenced by Dadaism and tended to use found objects in his collages as a means of dissolving the boundary between high and low culture.

<text>Debian (), also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a free and open source Linux distribution, developed by the Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock in August 1993. Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel, and is the basis of many other Linux distributions.

As of September 2023, Debian is the second-oldest Linux distribution still in active development: only Slackware is older. The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

In general, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to some of the principles of the GNU Project and Free Software. Because of this, the Free Software Foundation sponsored the project from November 1994 to November 1995. However, Debian is no longer endorsed by GNU and the FSF because of the distribution&#x27;s long-term practice of hosting non-free software repositories and, since 2022, its inclusion of non-free firmware in its installation media by default. On June 16, 1997, the Debian Project founded the nonprofit organization Software in the Public Interest to continue financing its development.

== History ==
=== Debian version history ===
Debian distribution codenames are based on the names of characters from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films. Debian&#x27;s &quot;unstable&quot; trunk is named after Sid, a character who regularly destroyed his toys.

=== Founding (1993–1998) ===
First announced on August 16, 1993, Debian was founded by Ian Murdock, who initially called the system &quot;the Debian Linux Release&quot;. The word &quot;Debian&quot; was formed as a portmanteau of the first names of himself and his then-girlfriend (later ex-wife) Debra Lynn. Before Debian&#x27;s release, the Softlanding Linux System (SLS) had been a popular Linux distribution and the basis for Slackware. Murdock was motivated to launch a new distribution by what he saw as poor maintenance and the prevalence of bugs in SLS.

Debian 0.01, released on September 15, 1993, was the first of several internal releases. Version 0.90 was the first public release, supported through mailing lists hosted at Pixar. The release included the Debian Linux Manifesto, outlining Murdock&#x27;s view for the new operating system. In it he called for the creation of a distribution to be maintained &quot;openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU.&quot;

The Debian project released the 0.9x versions in 1994 and 1995. During this time it was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation for one year. Ian Murdock delegated the base system, the core packages of Debian, to Bruce Perens, while Murdock focused on the management of the growing project. The first ports to non-IA-32 architectures began in 1995, and Debian 1.1 was released in 1996. By that time and thanks to Ian Jackson, the dpkg package manager was already an essential part of Debian.

In 1996, Bruce Perens assumed the project leadership. Perens was a controversial leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship in the midst of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from the a.out to the ELF executable format. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer from a single floppy disk, and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.

Ian Jackson became the project leader in 1998. Debian 2.0 introduced the second official port, m68k. During this time the first port to a non-Linux kernel, Debian GNU/Hurd, was started. On December 2, the first Debian Constitution was ratified.

=== Leader election (1999–2005) ===
From 1999, the project leader was elected yearly. The number of applicants was overwhelming and the project established the new member process. The package manager front-end APT was deployed with Debian 2.1. The first Debian derivatives, namely Libranet, Corel Linux and Stormix&#x27;s Storm Linux, were started in 1999. The 2.2 release in 2000 was dedicated to Joel Klecker, a developer who had recently died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

In late 2000, the project reorganized the archive with new package &quot;pools&quot; and created the &quot;Testing&quot; trunk, made up of packages considered stable, to reduce the freeze for the next release. In the same year, developers began holding an annual conference called DebConf with talks and workshops for developers and technical users. In May 2001, Hewlett-Packard announced plans to base its Linux development on Debian.

In July 2002, the project released version 3.0, code-named Woody, the first release to include cryptographic software, a free-licensed KDE and internationalization. During these last release cycles, the Debian project drew considerable criticism from the free software community because of the long time between stable releases.

Some events disturbed the project while the Sarge release was in preparation, as Debian servers were attacked by fire and hackers. One of the most memorable was the Vancouver prospectus. After a meeting held in Vancouver, release manager Steve Langasek announced a plan to reduce the number of supported ports to four in order to shorten future release cycles. There was a large reaction because the proposal looked more like a decision and because such a drop would damage Debian&#x27;s aim to be &quot;the universal operating system&quot;.

The first version of the Debian-based Ubuntu distribution, named &quot;4.10 Warty Warthog&quot;, was released on October 20, 2004. Because it was distributed as a free download, it became one of the most popular and successful operating systems with more than &quot;40 million users&quot; according to Canonical Ltd. However, Murdock was critical of the differences between Ubuntu packages and Debian, stating that it led to incompatibilities.

===Sarge and later releases (2005–present)===

The 3.1 Sarge release was made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the software and included over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a modular design, Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational or had a medical affiliation, and of packages made for people with disabilities.
In 2006, as a result of a much-publicized dispute, Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian. The Mozilla Corporation stated that software with unapproved modifications could not be distributed under the Firefox trademark. Two reasons that Debian had modified the Firefox software were to replace non-free artwork and to provide security patches. Consequently, Debian contained a fork of Firefox named Iceweasel and one of Thunderbird named Icedove. In February 2016, it was announced that Mozilla and Debian had reached an agreement and Iceweasel would revert to the name Firefox; a similar agreement was anticipated for Icedove/Thunderbird.

A fund-raising experiment, Dunc-Tank, was created to solve the release cycle problem and release managers were paid to work full-time; in response, unpaid developers slowed down their work and the release was delayed.

Debian 4.0 (Etch) was released in April 2007, featuring the x86-64 port and a graphical installer.

Debian 5.0 (Lenny) was released in February 2009, supporting Marvell&#x27;s Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC. The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer, a developer who died in a car crash.

In July 2009, the policy of time-based development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended to blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian&#x27;s policy of feature-based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle was going to be especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.

Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) was released in February 2011, featuring Debian GNU/kFreeBSD as a technology preview, along with adding a dependency-based boot system, and moving problematic firmware to the non-free section.

Debian 7 (Wheezy) was released in May 2013, featuring multiarch support.

Debian 8 (Jessie) was released in April 2015, using systemd as the new init system.

Debian 9 (Stretch) was released in June 2017, with nftables as a replacement for iptables, support for Flatpak apps, and MariaDB as the replacement for MySQL.

Debian 10 (Buster) was released in July 2019, adding support for Secure Boot and enabling AppArmor by default.

Debian 11 (Bullseye) was released in August 2021, enabling persistency in the system journal, adding support for driverless scanning, and containing kernel-level support for exFAT filesystems.

Debian 12 (Bookworm) was released on June 10, 2023, including various improvements and features, increasing the supported Linux Kernel to version 6.1, and leveraging new &quot;Emerald&quot; artwork. Debian 12 also was the first version under a revised Debian Social Contract that includes non-free firmware in its installation media by default, if and when the installer detects that it is needed for installed hardware to function, such as with Wi-Fi cards.

Debian is still in development and new packages are uploaded to &quot;unstable&quot; every day.

Debian used to be released as a very large set of CDs for each architecture, but with the release of Debian 9 (Stretch) in 2017, many of the images have been dropped from the archive but remain buildable via jigdo.

Throughout Debian&#x27;s lifetime, both the Debian distribution and its website have won various awards from different organizations, including &quot;Server Distribution of the Year&quot; 2011, &quot;The best Linux distro of 2011&quot;, and a &quot;Best of the Net&quot; award for October 1998.

On December 2, 2015, Microsoft announced that they would offer Debian GNU/Linux as an endorsed distribution on the Azure cloud platform. Microsoft has also added a user environment to their Windows 10 desktop operating system called Windows Subsystem for Linux that offers a Debian subset.

== Features ==


Debian has access to online repositories that contain over 51,000 packages. Debian officially contains only free software, but non-free software can be downloaded and installed from the Debian repositories. Debian includes popular free programs such as LibreOffice, Firefox web browser, Evolution mail, K3b disc burner, VLC media player, GIMP image editor, and Evince document viewer. Debian is a popular choice for servers, for example as the operating system component of a LAMP stack.

=== Kernels ===
Several flavors of the Linux kernel exist for each port. For example, the i386 port has flavors for IA-32 PCs supporting Physical Address Extension and real-time computing, for older PCs, and for x86-64 PCs. The Linux kernel does not officially contain firmware lacking source code, although such firmware is available in non-free packages and alternative installation media.

=== Desktop environments ===
Debian offers CD and DVD images specifically built for Xfce, GNOME, KDE, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, and LXQt. MATE support was added in 2014, and Cinnamon support was added with Debian 8 Jessie. Less common window managers such as Enlightenment, Openbox, Fluxbox, IceWM, Window Maker and others are available.

The default desktop environment of version 7 Wheezy was temporarily switched to Xfce, because GNOME 3 did not fit on the first CD of the set. The default for the version 8 Jessie was changed again to Xfce in November 2013, and back to GNOME in September 2014.

=== Localization ===
Several parts of Debian are translated into languages other than American English, including package descriptions, configuration messages, documentation and the website. The level of software localization depends on the language, ranging from the highly supported German and French to the barely translated Creek and Samoan. The Debian 10 installer is available in 76 languages.

=== Multimedia support ===

Multimedia support has been problematic in Debian regarding codecs threatened by possible patent infringements, lacking source code, or under too restrictive licenses. Even though packages with problems related to their distribution could go into the non-free area, software such as libdvdcss is not hosted at Debian .

A notable third party repository exists, formerly named Debian-multimedia.org, providing software not present in Debian such as Windows codecs, libdvdcss and the Adobe Flash Player. Even though this repository is maintained by Christian Marillat, a Debian developer, it is not part of the project and is not hosted on a Debian server. The repository provides packages already included in Debian, interfering with the official maintenance. Eventually, project leader Stefano Zacchiroli asked Marillat to either settle an agreement about the packaging or to stop using the &quot;Debian&quot; name. Marillat chose the latter and renamed the repository to deb-multimedia.org. The repository was so popular that the switchover was announced by the official blog of the Debian project.

== Distribution ==

Debian offers DVD and CD images for installation that can be downloaded using BitTorrent or jigdo. Physical discs can also be bought from retailers. The full sets are made up of several discs (the amd64 port consists of 13 DVDs or 84 CDs), but only the first disc is required for installation, as the installer can retrieve software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories.

Debian offers different network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian is available via the &quot;netinst&quot; CD, whereby Debian is installed with just a base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. Another option is to boot the installer from the network.

The default bootstrap loader is GNU GRUB version 2, though the package name is simply grub, while version 1 was renamed to grub-legacy. This conflicts with distros (e.g., Fedora Linux), where grub version 2 is named grub2.

The default desktop may be chosen from the DVD boot menu among GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXDE, and LXQt and from special disc 1 CDs.

Debian releases live install images for CDs, DVDs and USB thumb drives, for IA-32 and x86-64 architectures, and with a choice of desktop environments. These &quot;Debian Live&quot; images allow users to boot from removable media and run Debian without affecting the contents of their computer. A full install of Debian to the computer&#x27;s hard drive can be initiated from the live image environment. Personalized images can be built with the live-build tool for discs, USB drives and for network booting purposes. Installation images are hybrid on some architectures and can be used to create a bootable USB drive (Live USB).

== Packages ==
Package management operations can be performed with different tools available on Debian, from the lowest level command dpkg to graphical front-ends like Synaptic. The recommended standard for administering packages on a Debian system is the apt toolset.

dpkg provides the low-level infrastructure for package management. The dpkg database contains the list of installed software on the current system. The dpkg command tool does not know about repositories. The command can work with local .deb package files, and information from the dpkg database.

=== APT tools ===
An Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) allows a Debian system to retrieve and resolve package dependencies from repositories. APT tools share dependency information and cached packages.
* The apt command itself is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT like apt-get and apt-cache explained below.
* apt-get and apt-cache are command tools of the standard apt package. apt-get installs and removes packages, and apt-cache is used for searching packages and displaying package information.
* Aptitude is a command line tool that also offers a text-based user interface. The program comes with enhancements such as better search on package metadata.

=== GDebi and other front-ends ===

GDebi is an APT tool which can be used in command-line and on the GUI. GDebi can install a local .deb file via the command line like the dpkg command, but with access to repositories to resolve dependencies. Other graphical front-ends for APT include Software Center, Synaptic and Apper.

GNOME Software is a graphical front-end for PackageKit, which itself can work on top of various software packaging systems.

=== Repositories ===
The Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) define the distinctive meaning of the word &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free and open-source software&quot;. Packages that comply with these guidelines, usually under the GNU General Public License, Modified BSD License or Artistic License, are included inside the &quot;main&quot; area; otherwise, they are included inside the &quot;non-free&quot; and &quot;contrib&quot; areas. These last two areas are not distributed within the official installation media, but they can be adopted manually.

Non-free includes packages that do not comply with the DFSG, such as documentation with invariant sections and proprietary software, and legally questionable packages. Contrib includes packages which do comply with the DFSG but fail other requirements. For example, they may depend on packages which are in non-free or requires such for building them.

Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have criticized the Debian project for hosting the non-free repository and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time it came to a vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.

=== Cross-distribution package managers ===
The most popular optional Linux cross-distribution package manager are graphical (front-ends) package managers. They are available within the official Debian Repository but are not installed by default. They are widely popular with both Debian users and Debian software developers who are interested in installing the most recent versions of application or using the cross-distribution package manager built-in sandbox environment. While at the same time remaining in control of the security.

Four most popular cross-distribution package managers, sorted in alphabetical order:
* AppImage Linux distribution-agnostic binary software deployment
* Flatpak software code is owned and maintained by the not for profit Flatpak Team, with an open source LGPL-2.1-or-later license.
* Homebrew software code is owned and maintained by its original author Max Howell, with an open source BSD 2-Clause License.
* Snap software code is owned and maintained by the for profit Canonical Group Limited, with an open source GNU General Public License, version 3.0.

== Branches ==

Three branches of Debian (also called &quot;releases&quot;, &quot;distributions&quot; or &quot;suites&quot;) are regularly maintained:
* &quot;Stable&quot; is the current release and targets stable and well-tested software needs. &quot;Stable&quot; is made by freezing &quot;Testing&quot; for a few months where bugs are fixed and packages with too many bugs are removed; then the resulting system is released as &quot;stable&quot;. It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated. This branch has an optional backports service that provides more recent versions of some software. &quot;Stable&quot;″s CDs and DVDs can be found in the Debian website. The current version of &quot;Stable&quot; is codenamed &quot;bookworm&quot;.
* &quot;Testing&quot; is the preview branch that will eventually become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in &quot;unstable&quot; but they may not be fit for release yet. It contains newer packages than &quot;stable&quot; but older than &quot;unstable&quot;. This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. &quot;Testing&quot;″s CDs and DVDs can be found on the Debian website. The current version of &quot;Testing&quot; is codenamed &quot;trixie&quot;.
* &quot;Unstable&quot;, always codenamed &quot;sid&quot;, is the trunk. Packages are accepted without checking the distribution as a whole. This branch is usually run by software developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those who prefer bleeding-edge software. Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs, but rather a minimal ISO that can be used to install over a network connection. Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;testing&quot;.

Other branches in Debian:
* &quot;Oldstable&quot; is the prior &quot;stable&quot; release. It is supported by the Debian Security Team until one year after a new &quot;stable&quot; is released, and since the release of Debian 6, for another two years through the Long Term Support project. Eventually, &quot;oldstable&quot; is moved to a repository for archived releases. Debian 11 is the current Oldstable release (since 2023-06-10).
* &quot;Oldoldstable&quot; is the prior &quot;oldstable&quot; release. It is supported by the Long Term Support community. Eventually, &quot;oldoldstable&quot; is moved to a repository for archived releases. Debian 10 is the current Oldoldstable release (since 2023-06-10).
* &quot;Experimental&quot; is a temporary staging area of highly experimental software that is likely to break the system. It is not a full distribution and missing dependencies are commonly found in &quot;unstable&quot;, where new software without the damage chance is normally uploaded.

The &quot;snapshot&quot; archive provides older versions of the branches. They may be used to install a specific older version of some software.

=== Numbering scheme ===
&quot;Stable&quot; and &quot;oldstable&quot; get minor updates, called &quot;point releases&quot;; , the &quot;stable&quot; release is version 11.7, released on , and the &quot;oldstable&quot; release is version 10.10.

The numbering scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was to include the letter &quot;r&quot; (for &quot;revision&quot;) after the main version number and then the number of the point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.

From Debian 5.0, the numbering scheme of point releases was changed, conforming to the GNU version numbering standard; the first point release of Debian 5.0 was 5.0.1 instead of 5.0r1. The numbering scheme was once again changed for the first Debian 7 update, which was version 7.1. The &quot;r&quot; scheme is no longer in use, but point release announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs.

== Branding ==
Debian has two logos. The official logo (also known as &lt;q&gt;&quot;open use logo&quot;&lt;/q&gt;) contains the well-known Debian &lt;q&gt;&quot;swirl&quot;&lt;/q&gt; and best represents the visual identity of the Debian Project. A separate logo also exists for use by the Debian Project and its members only.

The Debian &quot;swirl&quot; logo was designed by Raul Silva in 1999 as part of a contest to replace the semi-official logo that had been used. The winner of the contest received an @Debian.org email address, and a set of Debian 2.1 install CDs for the architecture of their choice. Initially, the swirl was magic smoke arising from an also included bottle of an Arabian-style genie presented in black profile, but shortly after was reduced to the red smoke swirl for situations where space or multiple colours were not an option, and before long the bottle version effectively was superseded. There has been no official statement from the Debian project on the logo&#x27;s meaning, but at the time of the logo&#x27;s selection, it was suggested that the logo represented the magic smoke that made computers work.

One theory about the origin of the Debian logo is that Buzz Lightyear, the chosen character for the first named Debian release, has a swirl in his chin. Stefano Zacchiroli also suggested that this swirl is the Debian one. Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s swirl is a more likely candidate as the codenames for Debian are names of Toy Story characters. The former Debian project leader Bruce Perens used to work for Pixar and is credited as a studio tools engineer on &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999).

== Hardware ==

Hardware requirements are at least those of the kernel and the GNU toolsets. Debian&#x27;s recommended system requirements depend on the level of installation, which corresponds to increased numbers of installed components:

The real minimum memory requirements depend on the architecture and may be much less than the numbers listed in this table. It is possible to install Debian with 170 MB of RAM for x86-64; the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition. The installer for z/Architecture requires about 20 MB of RAM, but relies on network hardware. Similarly, disk space requirements, which depend on the packages to be installed, can be reduced by manually selecting the packages needed. , no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily.

It is possible to run graphical user interfaces on older or low-end systems. However, the installation of window managers instead of desktop environments is recommended, as desktop environments are more resource intensive. Requirements for individual software vary widely and must be considered, with those of the base operating environment.

=== Architectures ===
, the official ports are:
* amd64: x86-64 architecture with 64-bit userland and supporting 32-bit software
* arm64: ARMv8-A architecture

Debian supports a variety of ARM-based NAS devices. The NSLU2 was supported by the installer in Debian 4.0 and 5.0, and Martin Michlmayr is providing installation tarballs since version 6.0. Other supported NAS devices are the Buffalo Kurobox Pro, GLAN Tank, Thecus N2100 and QNAP Turbo Stations.

Devices based on the Kirkwood system on a chip (SoC) are supported too, such as the SheevaPlug plug computer and OpenRD products. There are efforts to run Debian on mobile devices, but this is not a project goal yet since the Debian Linux kernel maintainers would not apply the needed patches. Nevertheless, there are packages for resource-limited systems.

There are efforts to support Debian on wireless access points. Debian is known to run on set-top boxes. Work is ongoing to support the AM335x processor, which is used in electronic point of service solutions. Debian may be customized to run on cash machines.

BeagleBoard, a low-power open-source hardware single-board computer (made by Texas Instruments) has switched to Debian Linux preloaded on its Beaglebone Black board&#x27;s flash.

Roqos Core, manufactured by Roqos, is a x86-64 based IPS firewall router running Debian Linux.

== Organization ==

Debian&#x27;s policies and team efforts focus on collaborative software development and testing processes. As a result, a new major release tends to occur every two years with revision releases that fix security issues and important problems. The Debian project is a volunteer organization with three foundational documents:
* The &quot;Debian Social Contract&quot; defines a set of basic principles by which the project and its developers conduct affairs.
* The &quot;Debian Free Software Guidelines&quot; define the criteria for &quot;free software&quot; and thus what software is permissible in the distribution. These guidelines have been adopted as the basis of the Open Source Definition. Although this document can be considered separate, it formally is part of the Social Contract.
* The &quot;Debian Constitution&quot; describes the organizational structure for formal decision-making within the project, and enumerates the powers and responsibilities of the Project Leader, the Secretary and other roles.

Debian developers are organized in a web of trust. There are about one thousand active Debian developers, but it is possible to contribute to the project without being an official developer.

The project maintains official mailing lists and conferences for communication and coordination between developers. For issues with single packages and other tasks, a public bug tracking system is used by developers and end users. Internet Relay Chat is also used for communication among developers and to provide real time help.

Debian is supported by donations made to organizations authorized by the leader. The largest supporter is Software in the Public Interest, the owner of the Debian trademark, manager of the monetary donations and umbrella organization for various other community free software projects.

A Project Leader is elected once per year by the developers. The leader has special powers, but they are not absolute, and appoints delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).

Project leadership is distributed occasionally. Branden Robinson was helped by the Project Scud, a team of developers that assisted the leader, but there were concerns that such leadership would split Debian into two developer classes. Anthony Towns created a supplemental position, Second In Charge (2IC), that shared some powers of the leader. Steve McIntyre was 2IC and had a 2IC himself.

One important role in Debian&#x27;s leadership is that of a release manager. The release team sets goals for the next release, supervises the processes and decides when to release. The team is led by the next release managers and stable release managers. Release assistants were introduced in 2003.

=== Developers ===
The Debian Project has an influx of applicants wishing to become developers. These applicants must undergo a vetting process which establishes their identity, motivation, understanding of the project&#x27;s principles, and technical competence. This process has become much harder throughout the years.

Debian developers join the project for many reasons. Some that have been cited include:
* Debian is their main operating system and they want to promote Debian
* To improve the support for their favorite technology
* They are involved with a Debian derivative
* A desire to contribute back to the free-software community
* To make their Debian maintenance work easier

Debian developers may resign their positions at any time or, when deemed necessary, they can be expelled. Those who follow the retiring protocol are granted the &quot;emeritus&quot; status and they may regain their membership through a shortened new member process.

== Development ==
Flowchart of the life cycle of a Debian package

Each software package has a &quot;maintainer&quot; that may be either one person or a team of Debian developers and non-developer maintainers. The maintainer keeps track of upstream releases, and ensures that the package coheres with the rest of the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian. Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.

The maintainer releases a new version by uploading the package to the &quot;incoming&quot; system, which verifies the integrity of the packages and their digital signatures. If the package is found to be valid, it is installed in the package archive into an area called the &quot;pool&quot; and distributed every day to hundreds of mirrors worldwide. The upload must be signed using OpenPGP-compatible software. All Debian developers have individual cryptographic key pairs. Developers are responsible for any package they upload even if the packaging was prepared by another contributor.

Initially, an accepted package is only available in the &quot;unstable&quot; branch. For a package to become a candidate for the next release, it must migrate to the &quot;Testing&quot; branch by meeting the following:
* It has been in &quot;unstable&quot; for a certain length of time that depends on the urgency of the changes.
* It does not have &quot;release-critical&quot; bugs, except for the ones already present in &quot;Testing&quot;. Release-critical bugs are those considered serious enough that they make the package unsuitable for release.
* There are no outdated versions in &quot;unstable&quot; for any release ports.
* The migration does not break any packages in &quot;Testing&quot;.
* Its dependencies can be satisfied by packages already in &quot;Testing&quot; or by packages being migrated at the same time.
* The migration is not blocked by a freeze.

Thus, a release-critical bug in a new version of a shared library on which many packages depend may prevent those packages from entering &quot;Testing&quot;, because the updated library must meet the requirements too. From the branch viewpoint, the migration process happens twice per day, rendering &quot;Testing&quot; in perpetual beta.

Periodically, the release team publishes guidelines to the developers in order to ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the &quot;Testing&quot; branch and any other significant issues are solved. At that time, all packages in the &quot;testing&quot; branch become the new &quot;stable&quot; branch. Although freeze dates are time-based, release dates are not, which are announced by the release managers a couple of weeks beforehand.

A version of a package can belong to more than one branch, usually &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot;. It is possible for a package to keep the same version between stable releases and be part of &quot;oldstable&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;, &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; at the same time. Each branch can be seen as a collection of pointers into the package &quot;pool&quot; mentioned above.

One way to resolve the challenge of a release-critical bug in a new application version is the use of optional package managers. They allow software developers to use sandbox environments, while at the same time remaining in control of security. Another benefit of a cross-distribution package manager is that they allow application developers to directly provide updates to users without going through distributions, and without having to package and test the application separately for each distribution.

=== Release cycle ===
A new &quot;stable&quot; branch of Debian gets released approximately every 2 years. It will receive official support for about 3 years with update for major security or usability fixes. Point releases will be available every several months as determined by Stable Release Managers (SRM).

Debian also launched its Long Term Support (LTS) project since Debian 6 (Debian Squeeze). For each Debian release, it will receive two years of extra security updates provided by LTS Team after its End Of Life (EOL). However, no point releases will be made. Now each Debian release can receive 5 years of security support in total.

=== Security ===
The Debian project handles security through public disclosure. Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary, are usually coordinated with other free software vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public. There used to be a security audit project that focused on packages in the stable release looking for security bugs; Steve Kemp, who started the project, retired in 2011 but resumed his activities and applied to rejoin in 2014.

The &quot;stable&quot; branch is supported by the Debian security team; &quot;oldstable&quot; is supported for one year. Although Squeeze is not officially supported, Debian is coordinating an effort to provide long-term support (LTS) until February 2016, five years after the initial release, but only for the IA-32 and x86-64 platforms. &quot;Testing&quot; is supported by the &quot;testing&quot; security team, but does not receive updates in as timely a manner as &quot;stable&quot;. &quot;Unstable&quot;″s security is left for the package maintainers.

The Debian project offers documentation and tools to harden a Debian installation both manually and automatically. AppArmor support is available and enabled by default since Buster. Debian provides an optional hardening wrapper, and does not harden all of its software by default using gcc features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection, unlike operating systems such as OpenBSD, but tries to build as many packages as possible with hardening flags.

In May 2008, a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack, since only 32,767 different keys were generated. The security weakness was caused by changes made in 2006 by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings. The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates.

=== Value ===
The cost of developing all of the packages included in Debian 5.0 Lenny (323 million lines of code) has been estimated to be about , using one method based on the COCOMO model. , Black Duck Open Hub estimated that the current codebase (74 million lines of code) would cost about to develop, using a different method based on the same model.

== Forks and derivatives ==

A large number of forks and derivatives have been built upon Debian over the years. Among the more notable are Ubuntu, developed by Canonical Ltd. and first released in 2004, which has surpassed Debian in popularity with desktop users; Knoppix, first released in the year 2000 and one of the first distributions optimized to boot from external storage; and Devuan, which gained attention in 2014 when it forked in disagreement over Debian&#x27;s adoption of the systemd software suite, and has been mirroring Debian releases since 2017. The Linux Mint Debian Edition (&quot;LMDE&quot;) uses Debian Stable as the software source base since 2014.

=== Derivatives and flavors ===
Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions, and many other distributions have been created from the Debian codebase. , DistroWatch lists 121 active Debian derivatives. The Debian project provides its derivatives with guidelines for best practices and encourages derivatives to merge their work back into Debian.

Debian Pure Blends are subsets of a Debian release configured out-of-the-box for users with particular skills and interests. For example, Debian Jr. is made for children, while Debian Science is for researchers and scientists. The complete Debian distribution includes all available Debian Pure Blends. &quot;Debian Blend&quot; (without &quot;Pure&quot;) is a term for a Debian-based distribution that strives to become part of mainstream Debian, and have its extra features included in future releases.

====Debian GNU/Hurd====

Debian GNU/Hurd is a flavor based on the Hurd kernel (which, in turn, runs on the GNU Mach microkernel), instead of the Linux kernel. Debian GNU/Hurd has been in development since 1998, and made a formal release in May 2013, with 78% of the software packaged for Debian GNU/Linux ported to the GNU Hurd. Hurd is not yet an official Debian release, and is maintained and developed as an unofficial port. Debian GNU/Hurd is distributed as an installer CD (running the official Debian installer) or ready-to-run virtual disk image (Live CD, Live USB). The CD uses the IA-32 architecture, making it compatible with IA-32 and x86-64 PCs. The current version of Debian GNU/Hurd is 2023, published in June 2023.

====Debian GNU/kFreeBSD====

Debian GNU/kFreeBSD is a discontinued Debian flavor. It used the FreeBSD kernel and GNU userland. The majority of software in Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was built from the same sources as Debian, with some kernel packages from FreeBSD. The &quot;k&quot; in &quot;kFreeBSD&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;kernel&quot;, which refers to the FreeBSD kernel. Before discontinuing the project, Debian maintained i386 and amd64 ports. The last version of Debian kFreeBSD was Debian 8 (Jessie) RC3. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was created in 2002. It was included in Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) as a technology preview, and in Debian 7 (Wheezy) as an official port. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was discontinued as an officially supported platform as of Debian 8. Debian developers cited OSS, pf, jails, NDIS, and ZFS as reasons for being interested in the FreeBSD kernel. It has not been officially updated since Debian 8. However, starting in July 2019, the operating system continued to be maintained unofficially. As of July 2023, the development of Debian GNU/kFreeBSD has officially terminated due to the lack of interest and developers.

<doc id="8243" wikidata="Q429433" url="?curid=8243" title="Doonesbury">
<text>Doonesbury is a comic strip by American cartoonist Garry Trudeau that chronicles the adventures and lives of an array of characters of various ages, professions, and backgrounds, from the President of the United States to the title character, Michael Doonesbury, who has progressed over the decades from a college student to a youthful senior citizen.

Created in &quot;the throes of &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s counterculture&quot;, and frequently political in nature, &quot;Doonesbury&quot; features characters representing a range of affiliations, but the cartoon is noted for a liberal viewpoint. The name &quot;Doonesbury&quot; is a combination of the word &quot;doone&quot; (American prep school slang for someone who is clueless, inattentive, or careless) and the surname of Charles Pillsbury, Trudeau&#x27;s roommate at Yale University.

&quot;Doonesbury&quot; is written and penciled by Garry Trudeau, then inked and lettered by an assistant, Don Carlton,
then Todd Pound. Sunday strips are colored by George Corsillo. &quot;Doonesbury&quot; was a daily strip through most of its existence, but since February 2014 it has run repeat strips Monday through Saturday, and new strips on Sunday.

==History==
&quot;Doonesbury&quot; began as a continuation of &quot;Bull Tales&quot;, which appeared in the Yale University student newspaper, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, from 1968 to 1970. It focused on local campus events at Yale.

&quot;Doonesbury&quot; proper debuted as a daily strip in twenty-eight newspapers on October 26, 1970 (it being the first strip from Universal Press Syndicate). A Sunday strip began on March 21, 1971. Many of the early strips were reprints of the &quot;Bull Tales&quot; cartoons, with some changes to the drawings and plots. B. D.&#x27;s helmet changed from having a &quot;Y&quot; (for Yale) to a star (for the fictional Walden College). Mike and B. D. started &quot;Doonesbury&quot; as roommates; they were not roommates in &quot;Bull Tales&quot;.

&quot;Doonesbury&quot; became known for its social and political commentary. By the 2010s, it was syndicated in approximately 1,400 newspapers worldwide.

In May 1975, &quot;Doonesbury&quot; became the first daily comic strip to win a Pulitzer Prize, taking the award for Editorial Cartooning. That year, U.S. President Gerald Ford told the Radio and Television Correspondents&#x27; Association at their annual dinner, &quot;There are only three major vehicles to keep us informed as to what is going on in Washington: the electronic media, the print media, and &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, not necessarily in that order.&quot;

===1983–1984 hiatus===
Trudeau took a 22-month hiatus, from January 2, 1983, to September 30, 1984. Before the break in the strip, the characters were eternal college students, living in a commune together near Walden College, which was modeled after Trudeau&#x27;s alma mater, Yale. During the break, Trudeau helped create a Broadway musical of the strip, showing the graduation of the main characters. The Broadway adaptation opened at the Biltmore Theatre on November 21, 1983, and played 104 performances. Elizabeth Swados composed the music for Trudeau&#x27;s book and lyrics.

===After the hiatus===
The strip resumed some time after the events in the musical, with further changes having taken place after the end of the musical&#x27;s plot. Mike, Mark, Zonker, B.D., and Boopsie were all now graduates; B.D. and Boopsie were living in Malibu, California, where B.D. was a third-string quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, and Boopsie was making a living from walk-on and cameo roles. Mark was living in Washington, D.C., working for National Public Radio. Michael and J.J. had gotten married, and Mike had dropped out of business school to start work in an advertising agency in New York City. Zonker, still not ready for the &quot;real world&quot;, was living with Mike and J.J. until he was accepted as a medical student at his Uncle Duke&#x27;s &quot;Baby Doc College&quot; in Haiti.

Prior to the hiatus, the strip&#x27;s characters had aged only slightly. But when Trudeau returned to &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, the characters began to age in something close to real time, as in &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; and &quot;For Better or for Worse&quot;, Since then, the main characters&#x27; ages and career developments have tracked those of standard media portrayals of baby boomers, with jobs in advertising, law enforcement, and the dot-com boom. Current events are mirrored through the original characters, their offspring (the &quot;second generation&quot;), and occasional new characters.

Garry Trudeau received the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 1994, and their Reuben Award for 1995 for his work on the strip.

=== &quot;Alpha House&quot; and hiatuses: 2013 ===
&quot;Doonesbury&quot; syndicate, Universal Uclick, announced on May 29, 2013, that the comic strip would go on hiatus from June 10 to Labor Day of that year while Garry Trudeau worked on his streaming video comedy &quot;Alpha House&quot;, which was picked up by Amazon Studios. &quot;Doonesbury Flashbacks&quot; were offered during those weeks, but due to the unusually long hiatus, some newspapers opted to run different comic strips instead. Sunday strips returned as scheduled, but the daily strip&#x27;s hiatus was extended until November 2013.

After &quot;Alpha House&quot; was renewed for a second season in February 2014, Trudeau announced that he would now produce only Sunday strips for the foreseeable future. Since March 3, 2014, the strip has offered reruns starting from the very beginning of its history as opposed to the recent ones that re-run when Trudeau is on vacation. &quot;Alpha House&quot; was cancelled in 2016, but Trudeau did not return to drawing Monday-to-Saturday strips, and continued his Sunday-only schedule.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Trudeau said that while Donald Trump appears in only a limited number of strips, &quot;for the last two years, he&#x27;s been subtext in almost all of them.&quot;

=== TV special ===
In 1977, Trudeau wrote a script for a 26-minute animated special, &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot;, which was produced and directed by Trudeau along with John Hubley (who died during the storyboarding stage) and Faith Hubley. The special was first broadcast by NBC on November 27, 1977. It won a Special Jury Award at the Cannes International Film Festival for best short film, and received an Oscar nomination (for best animated short film), both in 1978. Voice actors for the special included Barbara Harris, William Sloane Coffin Jr., Jack Gilford and Will Jordan. Also included were &quot;Stop in the Middle&quot; and &quot;I Do Believe&quot;, two songs &quot;sung&quot; by the character Jimmy Thudpucker, also part of the &quot;Special&quot;. While the compositions and performances were credited to &quot;Jimmy Thudpucker&quot;, they were in fact co-written and sung by James Allen &quot;Jimmy&quot; Brewer, who also co-wrote and provided the vocals for &quot;Ginny&#x27;s Song&quot;, a 1976 single on the Warner Bros. label, and &quot;Jimmy Thudpucker&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, an LP released by Windsong Records, John Denver&#x27;s subsidiary of RCA Records.

==Style==
With the exception of Walden College, Trudeau has frequently used real-life settings, based on real scenarios, but with fictional results. Because of lead times, real-world events have rendered some of Trudeau&#x27;s comics unusable, such as a 1973 series featuring John Ehrlichman, a 1989 series set in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, a 1993 series involving Zoë Baird, and a 2005 series involving Harriet Miers. Trudeau has also displayed fluency in various forms of jargon, including those of real estate agents, flight attendants, computer scientists, journalists, presidential aides, and soldiers in Iraq.

===Walden College===
The unnamed college attended by the main characters was later given the name &quot;Walden College&quot;, revealed to be in Connecticut (the same state as Yale), and depicted as devolving into a third-rate institution under the weight of grade inflation, slipping academic standards, and the end of tenure, issues that Trudeau has consistently revisited since the original characters graduated. Some of the second generation of &quot;Doonesbury&quot; characters have attended Walden, a venue Trudeau uses to advance his concerns about academic standards in the United States.

President King, the leader of Walden College, was originally intended as a parody of Kingman Brewster, President of Yale, but all that remains of that is a certain physical resemblance.

===Use of real-life politicians as characters===
Even though &quot;Doonesbury&quot; frequently features real-life U.S. politicians, they are rarely depicted with their real faces. Originally, strips featuring the President of the United States would show an external view of the White House, with dialogue emerging from inside. During the Gerald Ford administration, characters would be shown speaking to Ford at press conferences, and fictional dialogue supposedly spoken by Ford would be written as coming &quot;off-panel&quot;. Similarly, while having several characters as students in a class taught by Henry Kissinger, the dialogue made up for Kissinger would also come from &quot;off-panel&quot; (although Kissinger had earlier appeared as a character with his face shown in a 1972 series of strips in which he met Mark Slackmeyer while the latter was on a trip to Washington). Sometimes hands, or in rare cases, the back of heads would also be seen.

Later, personal symbols reflecting some aspect of their character came into use. These included:

* Ronald Reagan as &quot;Ron Headrest,&quot; a computer-generated video character in imitation of Max Headroom
* George H. W. Bush as a disembodied voice, indicating a lack of personality
* Dan Quayle as a talking feather, both as a pun on his name and representing him as a political lightweight
* Bill Clinton as a talking waffle in reference to his triangulation strategy
* Newt Gingrich as a talking fragmentation bomb, referring to his reputation as a political bomb-thrower
* White nationalist David Duke as a talking swastika
* George W. Bush initially as a disembodied voice wearing a Stetson hat, since he had been Governor of Texas. After his controversial election the voice became an asterisk, and during the War on Terror the hat was replaced with a Roman military helmet that grew increasingly worn.
* Arnold Schwarzenegger as a large hand due to accusations that he had groped women

The long career of the series and continual use of real-life political figures, analysts note, have led to some uncanny cases of the cartoon foreshadowing a national shift in the politicians&#x27; political fortunes. Tina Gianoulis in &quot;St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture&quot; observes that &quot;In 1971, well before the conservative Reagan years, a forward-looking B.D. called Ronald Reagan his &#x27;hero&#x27;. In 1984, almost ten years before Congressman Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, another character worried that he would &#x27;wake up someday in a country run by Newt Gingrich. In its 2003 series &quot;John Kerry: A Candidate in the Making&quot; on the 2004 presidential race, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reprinted and discussed 1971 &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoons of the young Kerry&#x27;s Vietnam War protest speeches.

==Characters==
&quot;Doonesbury&quot; has a large group of recurring characters, with 24 currently listed at the strip&#x27;s website. There, it notes that &quot;readers new to &quot;Doonesbury&quot; sometimes experience a temporary bout of character shock&quot;, as the sheer number of characters (and the historical connections among them) can be overwhelming.

The main characters are a group who attended the fictional Walden College during the strip&#x27;s first 12 years, and moved into a commune together in April 1972. Most of the other characters first appeared as family members, friends, or other acquaintances. The original Walden Commune residents were Mike Doonesbury, Zonker Harris, Mark Slackmeyer, Nichole, Bernie, and DiDi. In September 1972, Joanie Caucus joined the comic, meeting Mike and Mark in Colorado and eventually moving into the commune. They were later joined by B.D. and his girlfriend (later wife) Boopsie, upon B.D.&#x27;s return from Vietnam. Nichole, DiDi, and Bernie were mostly phased out in subsequent years, and Zonker&#x27;s Uncle Duke was introduced as the most prominent character outside the Walden group, and the main link to many secondary characters.

The Walden students graduated in 1983, after which the strip began to progress in something closer to real time. Their spouses and developing families became more important after this: Joanie&#x27;s daughter J.J. Caucus married Mike and they had a daughter, Alex Doonesbury. They divorced, Mike married Kim Rosenthal, a Vietnamese refugee (who had appeared in the strip as a baby adopted by a Jewish family just after the fall of Saigon; see Operation Babylift), and J.J. married Zeke Brenner, her former boyfriend and Uncle Duke&#x27;s former groundskeeper. Joanie married Rick Redfern, and they had a son, Jeff. Uncle Duke and Roland Hedley have also appeared often, frequently in more topical settings unconnected to the main characters. In more recent years the second generation has taken prominence as they have grown to college age: Jeff Redfern, Alex Doonesbury, Zonker&#x27;s nephew Zipper Harris, and Uncle Duke&#x27;s son Earl.

==Controversial strips and groundbreaking moments==

&quot;Doonesbury&quot; has covered numerous political and social issues, some of which were pioneering and others that drew criticism:

===1970s===
* A November 1972 Sunday strip depicting Zonker telling a little boy in a sandbox a fairy tale ending in the protagonist being awarded &quot;his weight in fine, uncut Turkish hashish&quot; raised an uproar.
* During the Watergate scandal, a strip showed Mark on the radio with a &quot;Watergate profile&quot; of John Mitchell, declaring him &quot;Guilty! Guilty, guilty, guilty!!&quot; A number of newspapers removed the strip and one, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, ran an editorial criticizing the cartoon. Following Richard Nixon&#x27;s death in 1994, the strip was rerun with all the instances of the word &quot;guilty&quot; crossed out and replaced with &quot;flawed&quot;.
* In June 1973, the military newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; dropped &quot;Doonesbury&quot; for being too political. The strip was quickly reinstated after hundreds of protests by military readers.
* September 1973: &quot;The Lincoln Journal&quot; became the first newspaper to move &quot;Doonesbury&quot; to its editorial page.
* In February 1976, a storyline included the character Andy Lippincott saying that he was gay. Dozens of papers opted not to publish the storyline, with &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editor Larry Jinks saying, &quot;We just decided we weren&#x27;t ready for homosexuality in a comic strip.&quot;
* In November 1976, when the storyline included the blossoming romance of Rick Redfern and Joanie Caucus, four days of strips were devoted to a transition from one apartment to another, ending with a view of the two together in bed, marking the first time any nationally run comic strip portrayed premarital sex in this fashion. The strip was removed from the comics pages of a number of newspapers, although some newspapers opted to simply repeat the opening frame of that day&#x27;s strip.
* In June 1978, a strip included a coupon listing various politicians and dollar amounts allegedly taken from Korean lobbyists, to be clipped and glued to a postcard to be sent to the Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill, resulting in an overflow of mail to the Speaker&#x27;s office.

===1980s===
* In 1985, a series of Doonesbury strips helped to repeal a 60-year-old discriminatory law in Palm Springs, in Orange County in Florida.
* In June 1985, a strip featuring Aniello Dellacroce and Frank Sinatra together, which referred to Dellacroce as an &quot;alleged human&quot; who has been charged with murder led to several papers dropping the strip and a statement from Sinatra.
*In December 1988, the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; dropped a Sunday strip featuring the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (in which a prospective executive cannot deny the link between smoking and cancer without bursting out laughing) because &quot;it would be personally offensive to its employees.&quot; It was the first time the strip had been pulled in deference to a corporation.
* In June 1989, several days&#x27; comics (which had already been drawn and written) had to be replaced with repeats, because the humor of the strips was considered in bad taste in light of the violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Trudeau himself asked for the recall, despite an interview published with Universal Press Syndicate Editorial Director Lee Salem in the May 28, 1989, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, in which Salem stated his hopes the strips could still be used.

===1990s===
* In November 1991, a series of strips appeared to give credibility to a real-life prison inmate who falsely stated that former Vice President Dan Quayle had connections with drug dealers. The strip sequence was dropped by some two dozen newspapers, in part because the allegations had been investigated and dispelled previously. Six years later, the reporter who broke the Quayle story, some weeks after the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoons, later published a book saying he no longer believed the story had been true.
* In November 1993, a storyline dealing with California wildfires was dropped from several California newspapers, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Orange County Register&quot;, and &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;.
* In June 1994, the Roman Catholic Church took issue with a series of strips dealing with the book &quot;Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe&quot; by John Boswell. A few newspapers dropped single strips from the series, and the Bloomington, Illinois, &quot;Pantagraph&quot; refused to run the entire series.
* In March 1995, John McCain denounced Trudeau on the floor of the Senate: &quot;Suffice it to say that I hold Trudeau in utter contempt.&quot; This was in response to a strip about Bob Dole&#x27;s strategy of exploiting his war record during his presidential campaign. The quotation was used on the cover of Trudeau&#x27;s book &quot;Doonesbury Nation&quot;. McCain and Trudeau later made peace: McCain wrote the foreword to &quot;The Long Road Home&quot;, Trudeau&#x27;s collection of comic strips dealing with character B.D.&#x27;s leg amputation during the second Iraq war.
* In February 1998, a strip dealing with Bill Clinton&#x27;s sex scandal was removed from the comics pages of a number of newspapers because it included the phrases &quot;oral sex&quot; and &quot;semen-streaked dress&quot;.

===2000s===
* In November 2000, a strip was not run in some newspapers when Duke said of presidential candidate George W. Bush: &quot;He&#x27;s got a history of alcohol abuse and cocaine.&quot;
* In September 2001, a strip perpetuated the Internet hoax that claimed George W. Bush had the lowest IQ of any president in the last 50 years, half that of Bill Clinton. When caught repeating the hoax, Trudeau apologized &quot;with a trademark barb – he said he deeply apologized for unsettling anyone who thought the president quite intelligent.&quot;
* In 2003, a cartoon that publicized the recent medical research suggesting a connection between masturbation and a reduced risk of prostate cancer, with one character alluding to the practice as &quot;self-dating&quot;, was not run in many papers; pre-publication sources indicated that as many as half of the 700 papers to which it was syndicated were planning not to run the strip.
* In February 2004, Trudeau used his strip to make the apparently genuine offer of $10,000 (to the USO in the winner&#x27;s name) for anyone who could personally confirm that George W. Bush was actually present during any part of his service in the National Guard. Reuters and CNN reported by the end of that week that despite 1,300 responses, no credible evidence had been offered. An FAQ posted on the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; site in September of that year noted that the submissions, while &quot;surreally entertaining&quot;, had failed to provide a single definitive corroborator, adding that Trudeau had donated the $10,000 to the USO anyway.
* April 2004: On April 21, after nearly 34 years, readers finally saw B.D.&#x27;s head without some sort of helmet. In the same strip, it was revealed that he had lost a leg in the Iraq War. Two days later, on April 23, after awakening and discovering his situation, B.D. exclaims &quot;SON OF A BITCH!!!&quot; The single strip was removed from many papers—including &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;—although in others, such as &quot;Newsday&quot;, the offending word was replaced by a line. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; ran the cartoon uncensored, with a footnote that the editor believed profanity was appropriate, given the subject matter. An image of B.D. with an amputated leg also appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that summer (issue 954).
* In June 2005, Trudeau published &quot;The Long Road Home&quot;, a book devoted to B.D.&#x27;s recovery from his loss of a leg in Iraq. Although Trudeau opposed the Iraq War, the foreword was written by Senator John McCain, a supporter of the war. McCain was impressed by Trudeau&#x27;s desire to highlight the struggle of seriously wounded veterans, and his desire to assist them. Proceeds from the book, and its sequel &quot;The War Within&quot; benefited Fisher House.
* July 2005: Several newspapers declined to run two strips in which George W. Bush refers to his adviser Karl Rove as &quot;Turd Blossom&quot;, a nickname Bush has been reported to use for Rove.
* In September 2005 when &quot;The Guardian&quot; relaunched in a smaller format, &quot;Doonesbury&quot; was dropped for reasons of space. After a flood of protests, the strip was reinstated with an omnibus covering the issues missed and a full apology.
* The strips scheduled to run from October 31 to November 5, 2005, and a Sunday strip scheduled for November 13 about the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court were withdrawn after her nomination was withdrawn. The strips have been posted on the official website, and were replaced by re-runs by the syndicate.
* Trudeau sought input from readers as to where Alex Doonesbury should attend college in a May 15, 2006, straw poll at Doonesbury.com. Voters chose among MIT, Rensselaer, and Cornell. Students from Rensselaer and then MIT hacked the system, which was designed to limit each computer to one vote. In the end, voters logged 175,000 votes, with MIT grabbing 48% of the total. The Doonesbury Town Hall FAQ stated that given that the rules of the poll had not ruled out such methods, &quot;the will, chutzpah, and bodacious craft of the voting public will be respected&quot;, declaring that Alex will be attending MIT.
* Before the 2008 presidential election, Trudeau sent out strips to run in the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: &quot;Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here&#x27;s the way I look at it: If Obama wins, I&#x27;m in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it&#x27;ll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I figure I can survive a little egg on my face.&quot; In response, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, &quot;We hope the strip proves to be as predictive as it is consistently lame.&quot;

===2010s===
* The sequence for the week of March 12–17, 2012, lampooning the changes in abortion law in several states was pulled or moved to the editorial page by a number of newspapers.
* In 2014, the site at doonesbury.com moved under washingtonpost.com, and now it redirects to the latter.

==Criticism==
When the strip became a success, veteran cartoonist Al Capp grudgingly admitted: “Anybody who can draw bad pictures of the White House four times in a row and succeed knows something I don’t. His style defies all measurement.”

Charles M. Schulz of &quot;Peanuts&quot; called Trudeau &quot;unprofessional&quot; for taking a long sabbatical. (See also, similar comments by Schulz about sabbaticals taken by Bill Watterson.) Nor was the return of the strip itself greeted with universal acclaim; in 1985, &quot;Saturday Review&quot; listed Trudeau as one of the country&#x27;s &quot;Most Overrated People in American Arts and Letters&quot;, commenting that the &quot;most publicized return since MacArthur&#x27;s has produced a strip that is predictable, mean-spirited, and not as funny as before.&quot;

&quot;Doonesbury&quot; has angered, irritated, or been rebuked by many of the political figures that have appeared or been referred to in the strip over the years. A 1984 series of strips showing Vice President George H. W. Bush placing his manhood in a blind trust—in parody of Bush&#x27;s use of that financial instrument to fend off concerns that his governmental decisions would be influenced by his investment holdings—brought the politician to complain, &quot;&quot;Doonesbury&quot; carrying water for the opposition. Trudeau is coming out of deep left field.&quot;

Some conservatives have intensely criticized &quot;Doonesbury&quot;. Several examples are cited in the Milestones section of the strip&#x27;s website. The strip has also met criticism from its readers almost since it began syndicated publication. For example, when Lacey Davenport&#x27;s husband Dick, in the last moments before his death, calls on God, several conservative pundits called the strip blasphemous. The sequence of Dick Davenport&#x27;s final bird-watching and fatal heart attack was run in November 1986.

Liberal politicians skewered by Trudeau in the strip have also complained, including Democrats such as former U.S. House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill and California Governor Jerry Brown.

Strips about post-World War II American wars have also generated controversy, including Vietnam, Grenada, Panama and both Gulf Wars.

After many letter-writing campaigns demanding the removal of the strip were unsuccessful, conservatives changed their tactics, and instead of writing to newspaper editors, they began writing to one of the printers who prints the color Sunday comics. In 2005, Continental Features refused to continue printing the Sunday &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, causing it to disappear from the 38 Sunday papers that Continental Features printed. Of the 38, only one newspaper, &quot;The Anniston Star&quot; in Anniston, Alabama, continued to carry the Sunday &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, though of necessity in black and white.

Some newspapers have dealt with the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to the editorial page, because many people believe that a politically based comic strip like &quot;Doonesbury&quot; does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section. The &quot;Lincoln Journal&quot; started the trend in 1973. In some papers (such as the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; and &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;) &quot;Doonesbury&quot; appears on the opinions page alongside &quot;Mallard Fillmore&quot;, a politically conservative comic strip.

==Awards and honors==
* In 1975, the strip won Trudeau a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning, the first strip cartoon to be so honored. The Editorial Cartoonists&#x27; Society subsequently passed a resolution condemning the Pulitzer Committee. (After being assured that the award was irrevocable, Trudeau supported the resolution.) &quot;Doonesbury&quot; was also a Nominated Pulitzer Finalist in 1990, 2004, and 2005.
* In 1977, the short film &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize from the Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;Best Short Film&quot;. It was also nominated for an Academy Award.
* Trudeau received Certificates of Achievement from the US Army 4th Battalion 67th Armor Regiment and the Ready First Brigade in 1991 for his comic strips dealing with the first Gulf War.

<text>A die (: dice, sometimes also used as ) is a small, throwable object with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. Dice are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.

A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are specifically designed or modified to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.

==History==
Dice have been used since before recorded history, and their origin is uncertain. It is hypothesized that dice developed from the practice of fortune-telling with the talus of hoofed animals, colloquially known as knucklebones. The Ancient Egyptian game of senet (played before 3000 BCE and up to the 2nd century CE) was played with flat two-sided throwsticks which indicated the number of squares a player could move, and thus functioned as a form of dice. Perhaps the oldest known dice were excavated as part of a backgammon-like game set at the Burnt City, an archeological site in south-eastern Iran, estimated to be from between 2800 and 2500 BCE. Bone dice from Skara Brae, Scotland have been dated to 3100–2400 BCE. Excavations from graves at Mohenjo-daro, an Indus Valley civilization settlement, unearthed terracotta dice dating to 2500–1900 BCE, including at least one die whose opposite sides all add up to seven, as in modern dice.

Games involving dice are mentioned in the ancient Indian &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;Atharvaveda,&quot; &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the Buddhist games list. Knucklebones was a game of skill played in ancient Greece; a derivative form had the four sides of bones receive different values like modern dice.

Although gambling was illegal, many Romans were passionate gamblers who enjoyed dicing, which was known as &quot;aleam ludere&quot; (&quot;to play at dice&quot;). There were two sizes of Roman dice. &quot;Tali&quot; were large dice inscribed with one, three, four, and six on four sides. &quot;Tesserae&quot; were smaller dice with sides numbered from one to six. Twenty-sided dice date back to the 2nd century CE and from Ptolemaic Egypt as early as the 2nd century BCE.

Dominoes and playing cards originated in China as developments from dice. The transition from dice to playing cards occurred in China around the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), and coincides with the technological transition from rolls of manuscripts to block printed books. In Japan, dice were used to play a popular game called sugoroku. There are two types of sugoroku. &quot;Ban-sugoroku&quot; is similar to backgammon and dates to the Heian period (794–1185 CE), while &quot;e-sugoroku&quot; is a racing game.

==Use==
Dice are thrown onto a surface either from the hand or from a container designed for this (such as a cup, tray, or tower). The face (or corner, in cases such as tetrahedral dice, or edge, for odd-numbered long dice) of the die that is uppermost when it comes to rest provides the value of the throw. 

The result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of classical mechanics (although luck is often credited for the results of a roll). A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower&#x27;s hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. 

One typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and &quot;Monopoly&quot;).

Thrown or simulated dice are sometimes used to generate specific probability distributions, which are fundamental to probability theory. For example, rolling a single six-sided die yields a uniform distribution, where each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of appearing. However, when rolling two dice and summing the results, the probability distribution shifts, as some sums (like 7) become more likely than others (like 2 or 12). These distributions can model real-world scenarios or mathematical constructs, making dice a practical tool for teaching and exploring concepts in probability theory.

==Construction==
===Arrangement===

Common dice are small cubes, most often across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)

Opposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, requiring the 1, 2, and 3 faces to share a vertex. The faces of a die may be placed clockwise or counterclockwise about this vertex. If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called &quot;right-handed&quot;. If those faces run clockwise, the die is called &quot;left-handed&quot;. Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.

The pips on standard six-sided dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. Red fours may be of Indian origin.

===Manufacturing===

In general, dice are classified as either &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;non-precision&quot;. Precision dice (also known as &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;gambling house&quot; dice) are used in casinos, while non-precision dice (also known as &quot;drugstore&quot; or &quot;candystore&quot; dice) are sold with social and board games. These types are easily distinguished with visual and tactile differences; precision dice generally are larger, translucent, and have flush markings, sharp corners and edges, while non-precision dice generally are smaller, opaque, and have recessed markings, rounded corners and edges.

Non-precision dice are manufactured via the plastic injection molding process, often made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The pips or numbers on the die are a part of the mold. Different pigments can be added to the dice to make them opaque or transparent, or multiple pigments may be added to make the dice speckled or marbled.

The coloring for numbering is achieved by submerging the die entirely in paint, which is allowed to dry. The die is then polished via a tumble finishing process similar to rock polishing. The abrasive agent scrapes off all of the paint except for the indents of the numbering. A finer abrasive is then used to polish the die. This process also produces the smoother, rounded edges on the dice.
Precision dice are generally made from bars of extruded cellulose acetate, sawed to the proper length to ensure that each face is as square as practical, generally with edges in length, with pips drilled deep and filled with opaque paint or epoxy which matches the density of cellulose, ensuring the dice remain balanced. The dice are buffed and polished to a gloss or sand finish after the pips are set, and the edges usually are left sharp, also called square or razor edge, although beveled or rounded edges, if performed evenly and consistently for each edge, are acceptable. Precision casino dice are transparent or translucent. This makes it difficult to incorporate internal weights which could bias the roll. To discourage cheating by dice substitution, each die carries a serial number and the casino&#x27;s logo or name. Local regulations and the intended game may affect the allowable dimensions and tolerances; for example, New Jersey specifies the maximum size of a die is on a side, except for the dice used in pai gow, which range from on a side.
Precision backgammon dice are made the same way and also feature pips flush with the surface of each face; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the dice cup and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.

===Etymology and terms===
The word die comes from Old French &quot;&quot;; from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;something which is given or played&quot;.

While the terms &quot;ace&quot;, &quot;deuce&quot;, &quot;trey&quot;, &quot;cater&quot;, &quot;cinque&quot; and &quot;sice&quot; are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. &quot;Ace&quot; is from the Latin &quot;as&quot;, meaning &quot;a unit&quot;; the others are 2 to 6 in Old French.

When rolling two dice, certain combinations have slang names. The term &quot;snake eyes&quot; is a roll of one pip on each die. The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; traces use of the term as far back as 1919.
The US term &quot;boxcars&quot;, also known as &quot;midnight&quot;, is a roll of six pips on each die. The pair of six pips resembles a pair of boxcars on a freight train. Many rolls have names in the game of craps.

===Unicode representation===
Using Unicode characters, the faces can be shown in text using the range U+2680 to U+2685 or using decimal codice_1 to codice_2, and the emoji using U+1F3B2 or codice_3 from the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block.

== Loaded dice ==
A loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more often or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice, as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.

==Variants==

===Polyhedral dice===

Various shapes such as two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. 

The modern tradition of using &quot;sets&quot; of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames, and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.

====Common variations====

Dice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.

Using these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions. 

Unlike other common dice, a four-sided (tetrahedral) die does not have a side that faces upward when it is at rest on a surface, so it must be read in a different way. On some four-sided dice, each face features multiple numbers, with the same number printed near each vertex on all sides. In this case, the number around the vertex pointing up is used. Alternatively, the numbers on a tetrahedral die can be placed at the middle of the edges, in which case the numbers around the base are used.

Normally, the faces on a die will be placed so opposite faces will add up to one more than the number of faces. (This is not possible with 4-sided dice and dice with an odd number of faces.) Some dice, such as those with 10 sides, are usually numbered sequentially beginning with 0, in which case the opposite faces will add to one less than the number of faces.

Some twenty-sided dice have a different arrangement used for the purpose of keeping track of an integer that counts down, such as health points. These &quot;spindown dice&quot; are arranged such that adjacent integers appear on adjacent faces, allowing the user to easily find the next lower number. They are commonly used with collectible card games.

====Rarer variations====
&quot;Uniform fair dice&quot; are dice where all faces have an equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is face-transitive. In addition to the Platonic solids, these theoretically include:

* Catalan solids, the duals of the 13 Archimedean solids: 12, 24, 30, 48, 60, 120 sides
* Trapezohedra, the duals of the infinite set of antiprisms, with kite faces: any even number not divisible by 4 (so that a face will face up), starting from 6
* Bipyramids, the duals of the infinite set of prisms, with triangle faces: any multiple of 4 (so that a face will face up), starting from 8
* Disphenoids, an infinite set of tetrahedra made from congruent non-regular triangles: 4 sides. This is a less symmetric tetrahedron than the Platonic tetrahedron but still sufficiently symmetrical to be face-transitive. Similarly, pyritohedra and tetartoids are less symmetrical but still face-transitive dodecahedra: 12 sides.

Two other types of polyhedra are technically not face-transitive but are still fair dice due to symmetry:

* antiprisms: the basis of barrel dice
* prisms: the basis of long dice and teetotums

Long dice and teetotums can, in principle, be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers. Long dice are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and daldøs.

===Non-numeric dice===

The faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;, Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.

===Alternatively-numbered dice===
Dice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the &quot;average&quot; die. These are six-sided dice with sides numbered codice_4, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required. Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.

===Spherical dice===

A die can be constructed in the shape of a sphere, with the addition of an internal cavity in the shape of the dual polyhedron of the desired die shape and an internal weight. The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.

==Applications==
Many board games use dice to randomize how far pieces move or to settle conflicts. Typically, this has meant that rolling higher numbers is better. Some games, such as &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;, have inverted this system by making the lower values more potent. In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In &quot;Castles of Burgundy&quot;, players spend their dice to take actions based on the die&#x27;s value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa. In &quot;Quarriors&quot; (and its descendant, &quot;Dice Masters&quot;), different sides of the dice can offer completely different abilities. Several sides often give resources while others grant the player useful actions.

Dice can be used for divination and using dice for such a purpose is called cleromancy. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as &quot;the dice of the gods&quot; and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.
Polyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like &quot;Exalted&quot; which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&amp;D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, dice notation is frequently used.

Astrological dice are a specialized set of three 12-sided dice for divination; the first die represents the planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the nodes of the Moon, the second die represents the 12 zodiac signs, and the third represents the 12 houses. A specialized icosahedron die provides the answers of the Magic 8 Ball, conventionally used to provide answers to yes-or-no questions.

Dice can be used to generate random numbers for use in passwords and cryptography applications. The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes a method by which dice can be used to generate passphrases. Diceware is a method recommended for generating secure but memorable passphrases, by repeatedly rolling five dice and picking the corresponding word from a pre-generated list.

===Notation===

In many gaming contexts, especially tabletop role-playing games, shorthand notations representing different dice rolls are used. A very common notation, considered a standard, expresses a dice roll as &quot;n&quot;d&quot;s&quot; or &quot;n&quot;D&quot;s&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of dice rolled and &quot;s&quot; is the number of sides on each die; if only one die is rolled, &quot;n&quot; is normally not shown. For example, codice_5 denotes one four-sided die; codice_6 means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and sum the results.

The notation also allows for adding or subtracting a constant amount &quot;c&quot; to the roll. When an amount is added, the notation is &quot;n&quot;d&quot;s&quot;+&quot;c&quot; or &quot;n&quot;D&quot;s&quot;+&quot;c&quot;; for example, codice_7 instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it. When an amount is to be subtracted, the notation is &quot;n&quot;d&quot;s&quot;-&quot;c&quot; or &quot;n&quot;D&quot;s&quot;-&quot;c;&quot; so codice_8 instructs the player to subtract four from the result of rolling codice_9. If the result of a modified dice roll is negative, it is often taken to be zero or one; for instance, when the dice roll determines the amount of damage to a creature.

<doc id="8246" wikidata="Q1110145" url="?curid=8246" title="Dumpster diving">
<text>Dumpster diving (also totting, skipping, skip diving or skip salvage) is from large commercial, residential, industrial and construction containers for unused items discarded by their owners but deemed useful to the picker. It is not confined to dumpsters and skips specifically and may cover standard household waste containers, curb sides, landfills or small dumps.

Different terms are used to refer to different forms of this activity. For picking materials from the curbside trash collection, expressions such as curb shopping, trash picking or street scavenging are sometimes used. In the UK, if someone is primarily seeking recyclable metal, they are [[scrapping]], and if they are picking the leftover food from farming left in the fields, they are [[gleaning]].

People dumpster dive for items such as clothing, furniture, food, and similar items in good working condition. Some people do this out of necessity due to poverty; others do it for ideological reasons or professionally and systematically for profit.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;dumpster diving&quot; emerged in the 1980s, combining &quot;diving&quot; with &quot;dumpster&quot;, a large commercial trash bin. The term &quot;Dumpster&quot; itself comes from the Dempster Dumpster, a brand of bins manufactured by Dempster Brothers beginning in 1937. &quot;Dumpster&quot; became genericized by the 1970s. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term &quot;dumpster diving&quot; is chiefly found in American English and first appeared in print in 1983, with the verb &quot;dumpster-dive&quot; appearing a few years later. In British English, the practice may be known as &quot;skipping&quot;, from skip, another term for this type of container.

Alternative names for the practice include bin-diving, containering, D-mart, dumpstering, totting, and skipping. In Australia, garbage picking is called &quot;skip dipping.&quot;

== Participants ==

The term &quot;binner&quot; is often used to describe individuals who collect recyclable materials for their deposit value. For example, in Vancouver, British Columbia, binners, or bottle collectors, search garbage cans and dumpsters for recyclable materials that can be redeemed for their deposit value. On average, these binners earn about $40 a day for several garbage bags full of discarded containers. Some are scammers seeking for receipts to use in committing return fraud.

The karung guni, Zabbaleen, the rag and bone man, waste picker, junk man or bin hoker are terms for people who make their living by sorting and trading trash. A similar process known as gleaning was practised in rural areas and some ancient agricultural societies, where the residue from farmers&#x27; fields was collected.

Some dumpster divers, who self-identify as freegans, aim to reduce their ecological footprint by living from dumpster-dived-goods, sometimes exclusively.

== Overview ==
The activity is performed by people out of necessity in the developing world. Some scavengers perform in organized groups, and some organize on various internet forums and social networking websites. By reusing, or repurposing, resources destined for the landfill, dumpster diving is sometimes considered to be an environmentalist endeavor, and is thus practiced by many pro-green communities. The wastefulness of consumer society and throw-away culture compels some individuals to rescue usable items (for example, computers or smartphones, which are frequently discarded due to the extensive use of planned obsolescence in the technology industry) from destruction and divert them to those who can make use of the items.

A wide variety of things may be disposed while still repairable or in working condition, making salvage of them a source of potentially free items for personal use, or to sell for profit. Irregular, blemished or damaged items that are still otherwise functional are regularly thrown away. Discarded food that might have slight imperfections, near its expiration date, or that is simply being replaced by newer stock is often tossed out despite being still edible. Many retailers are reluctant to sell this stock at reduced prices because of the risks that people will buy it instead of the higher-priced newer stock, that extra handling time is required, and that there are liability risks. In the United Kingdom, cookery books have been written on the cooking and consumption of such foods, which has contributed to the popularity of skipping. Artists often use discarded materials retrieved from trash receptacles to create works of found objects or assemblage.

Students have been known to partake in dumpster diving to obtain high tech items for technical projects, or simply to indulge their curiosity for unusual items. Dumpster diving can additionally be used in support of academic research. Garbage picking serves as the main tool for garbologists, who study the sociology and archeology of trash in modern life. Private and government investigators may pick through garbage to obtain information for their inquiries. Illegal cigarette consumption may be deduced from discarded packages.

Dumpster diving can be hazardous, due to potential exposure to biohazardous matter, broken glass, and overall unsanitary conditions that may exist in dumpsters.

Arguments against garbage picking often focus on the health and cleanliness implications of people rummaging in trash. This exposes the dumpster divers to potential health risks, and, especially if the dumpster diver does not return the non-usable items to their previous location, may leave trash scattered around. Divers can also be seriously injured or killed by garbage collection vehicles; in January 2012, in La Jolla, Swiss-American man Alfonso de Bourbon was killed by a truck while dumpster diving.

=== Dumpster diving with criminal intentions (Garbage theft) ===
The unauthorized taking of materials from a dumpster or other waste disposal container is commonly referred to as &quot;garbage theft&quot;. Dumpster diving is a different idiom. Due to the typical low value of the stolen goods, garbage theft is not typically recognized as a serious crime, with laws against it frequently focusing on combating identity theft instead. Depending on the state or nation&#x27;s rules surrounding low-level crime, garbage theft may be considered a form of petty theft and subject to a penalty that often entails a brief period of incarceration, a modest fine, or both. As a privacy violation, discarded medical records as trash led to a $140,000 penalty against Massachusetts billing company Goldthwait Associates and a group of pathology offices in 2013 and a $400,000 settlement between Midwest Women&#x27;s Healthcare Specialists and 1,532 clients in Kansas City in 2014.

Identity theft has historically been carried out through garbage theft, with thieves utilizing bank and credit card statements discovered in trash to assume the identity of a victim or access their credit.

Criminals have been known to dumpster dive for cash receipts as part of a scheme to steal items and return them for cash, a form of return fraud known as &quot;shoplisting.&quot; Police investigating shoplifting in Bellingham, Washington, found dozens of receipts from retailers such as The Home Depot, Rite Aid and Fred Meyer, along with a list of items on the receipts. Suspects believed to have taken receipts from trash receptacles near Walmart locations were arrested for return fraud in 2016 in Madison, Wisconsin.

== Legal status ==
Since dumpsters are usually located on private premises, divers may occasionally get in trouble for trespassing while dumpster diving, though the law is enforced with varying degrees of rigor. Some businesses may lock dumpsters to prevent pickers from congregating on their property, vandalism to their property, and to limit potential liability if a dumpster diver is injured while on their property.

Police searches of discarded waste as well as similar methods are also generally not considered violations of privacy rights; evidence seized in this manner has been permitted in many criminal trials. In the United States this has been affirmed by numerous courts including and up to the Supreme Court, in the decision &quot;California v. Greenwood&quot;. The doctrine is not as well established in regard to civil litigation.

Companies run by private investigators specializing in such techniques have emerged as a result of the need for discreet, undetected retrieval of documents and evidence for civil and criminal trials. Private investigators have also written books on &quot;P.I. technique&quot; in which dumpster diving or its equivalent &quot;wastebasket recovery&quot; figures prominently.

=== By country ===

==== Belgium ====
In 2009, a Belgian dumpster diver and eco-activist nicknamed Ollie was detained for a month for removing food from a garbage can and was accused of theft and burglary. On February 25, 2009, he was arrested for removing food from a garbage can at an AD Delhaize supermarket in Bruges. Ollie&#x27;s trial evoked protests in Belgium against restrictions from taking discarded food items.

==== Canada ====
In Ontario, Canada, the &quot;Trespass to Property Act&quot;—legislation dating back to the &quot;British North America Act&quot; of 1867—grants property owners and security guards the power to ban anyone from their premises, for any reason, permanently. This is done by issuing a notice to the intruder, who will only be breaking the law upon return. Similar laws exist in Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan. A recent case in Canada, which involved a police officer who retrieved a discarded weapon from a trash receptacle as evidence, created some controversy. The judge ruled the policeman&#x27;s actions as legal although there was no warrant present, which led some to speculate the event as validation for any Canadian citizen to raid garbage disposals.

==== United Kingdom ====
Skipping in England and Wales may qualify as theft within the Theft Act 1968 or as common-law theft in Scotland, though there is very little enforcement in practice.

==== Germany ====
In Germany, dumpster diving is referred to as &quot;containern&quot;, and a waste container&#x27;s contents are regarded as the property of the container&#x27;s owner. Therefore, taking items from such a container is viewed as theft. However, the police will routinely disregard the illegality of garbage picking since the items found are generally of low value. There has only been one known instance where people were prosecuted. In 2009 individuals were arrested on assumed burglary as they had surmounted a supermarket&#x27;s fence which was then followed by a theft complaint by the owner; the case was suspended.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the fourth amendment protects against certain searches by the government without a warrant. The 1988 &quot;California v. Greenwood&quot; case in the U.S. Supreme Court held that there is no common law expectation of privacy for discarded materials, and that therefore the police did not require a warrant to search through trash.

There are, however, limits to what can legally be taken from a company&#x27;s refuse. In a 1983 Minnesota case involving the theft of customer lists from a garbage can, &quot;Tennant Company v. Advance Machine Company&quot; (355 N.W.2d 720), the owner of the discarded information was awarded $500,000 in damages.

== Items ==

Dumpster diving is practiced differently in developed countries than in developing countries.
* Food. In many developing countries, food is rarely thrown away unless it is rotten as food is scarce in comparison to developed nations. In countries like the United States, where 40 to 50 percent of food is wasted, the trash contains a lot more food to gather. In many countries, charities collect excess food from supermarkets and restaurants and distribute it to impoverished neighbourhoods. Trash pickers, Karung guni, Zabaleen, and rag and bone men in these countries may concentrate on looking for usable items or scrap materials to sell rather than food items. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, some bakeries, grocery stores, or restaurants will routinely donate food according to a Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, but more often, because of health laws or company policy, they are required to discard food items by the expiration date, because of overstock, being overly ripened, spoiled, cosmetically imperfect, or blemished.
* Books and periodicals. As proof to publishing houses of unsold merchandise, booksellers will routinely remove the front covers of printed materials to render them destroyed prior to disposing of their remains in the garbage. Though readable, many damaged publications have disclaimers and legal notices against their existence or sale. 
* Irregular or damaged goods. Offices, factories, department stores, and other commercial establishments may equally throw out non-perishable items that are irregular, were returned, have minor damages, or are replaced by newer inventory. Many items tend to be in such a state of disrepair or cosmetically flawed that they will require some work to make the items functionally usable. For this reason, employees will at times intentionally destroy their items prior to being discarded to prevent them from being reused or resold.
* Returned items. Manufacturers often find it cheaper to routinely discard items returned as defective under warranty instead of repairing them, although a device is often repairable or usable as a source of spare parts to repair other, similar discarded devices.
* School supplies. At the end of each school year many perfectly useful supplies like pencils, pens, notebooks and art supplies are thrown away.
* Electronic waste. Some consumer electronics are dumped because of their rapid depreciation, obsolescence, cost to repair, or expense to upgrade. Owners of functional computers may find it easier to dump them rather than donate because many nonprofit organizations and schools are unable, or unwilling, to work with used equipment. Occasionally, vendors dispose of unsaleable, non-defective new merchandise as landfill. The Atari video game burial in Alamogordo, New Mexico, after the video game crash of 1983 is a well-known example; a 2014 excavation recovered about 1300 games for curation as museum exhibits or auction.

* Clothing. While thrift stores routinely refuse used goods which they cannot cheaply and easily resell, the items which they do accept cost them nothing. There is therefore no shrinkage cost associated with discarding mendable garments, repairable appliances or even working donated items which are overstock or find no buyer after some arbitrary length of time.
* Metal. Sometimes waste may contain recyclable metals and materials that can be reused or sold to recycling plants and scrap yards. The most common recyclable metals found are steel and aluminum.
* Wood. Called urban lumberjacking, to salvage wood either for home heating, or home construction projects.
* Empty cans and bottles. Several countries, particularly in Northern Europe have enforced a system in which empty cans and bottles can be returned to stores for money. Usually the amount received per can/bottle is relatively low, so many simply discard them in dumpsters.
* Personal Information: cyber attackers may engage in dumpster diving to gather sensitive data, including IP addresses, bank account details, and Social Security numbers, by sifting through discarded mail or retrieving items disposed of in bins. Moreover, perpetrators may endeavor to broaden their contact databases by resorting to dumpster diving at corporate premises, aiming to obtain access to confidential and sensitive data, including phone lists or records.

=== Other sources ===
* Residential buildings. Clothing, furniture, appliances, and other housewares may be found at residential buildings.
* College dormitories. Items may be found at colleges with dormitories at the end of the semester when students throw away many items such as furniture, clothes and electronics.

== Notable instances ==
In the 1960s, Jerry Schneider, using recovered instruction manuals from The Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, used the company&#x27;s own procedures to acquire hundreds of thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of telephone equipment over several years until his arrest.

The &quot;Castle Infinity&quot; videogame, after its shutdown in 2005, was brought back from the dead by a fan rescuing its servers from the trash.

In October 2013, in North London, three men were arrested and charged under the 1824 Vagrancy Act when they were caught taking discarded food: tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese and cakes from bins behind an Iceland supermarket. The charges were dropped on 29 January 2014 after much public criticism as well as a request by Iceland&#x27;s chief executive, Malcolm Walker.

In 1996, the source code for the Atari 7800 was discovered in the dumpster of the Atari office when the company closed.

== In popular culture ==

=== Books ===
* Author John Hoffman wrote two books based on his own dumpster-diving exploits: &quot;The Art and Science of Dumpster Diving&quot; (1993; ) and &quot;Dumpster Diving: The Advanced Course: How to Turn Other People&#x27;s Trash into Money, Publicity, and Power&quot; (2002; ), and was featured in the documentary DVD &quot;The Ultimate Dive&quot;, which was directed by Suzanne Girot and described by the Internet Movie Database as a &quot;Tongue-in-cheek how-to film on the art and science of dumpster diving.&quot;
* In 2001, dumpster diving was popularized in the book &quot;Evasion,&quot; published by CrimethInc.
* In Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Fifty Degrees Below&quot; (2005), the character Frank Vanderwal joins, for a time, a group of freegans (referred to as &quot;fregans&quot; in the novel) who frequently prepare feasts culled from dumpsters; kind-hearted restaurateurs aid them by setting aside foods which have not been touched by the public.
* Jeff Ferrell, Professor of Sociology at Texas Christian University, is the author of &quot;Empire of Scrounge: Inside the Urban Underground of Dumpster Diving, Trash Picking, and Street Scavenging&quot; (2005; ).
* Cory Doctorow integrated garbage picking characters into the plots of his novels &quot;Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town&quot; and &quot;Pirate Cinema&quot;.
* David Boarder Gilles&#x27; &quot;A Mass Conspiracy to Feed People: Food Not Bombs and the World-class Waste of Global Cities&quot; (2021) is an ethnography of this global movement of grassroots soup kitchens that recover wasted grocery surpluses and redistribute them to those in need.

=== Television programs ===
* British television shows have featured home renovations and decoration using salvaged materials. &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; (1996–2004) is one such show, broadcast on BBC One.
* TLC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Cheapskates&quot; and &quot;Extreme Couponing&quot; featured people who regularly dumpster dive to avoid spending money on different items—in the case of the latter, unwanted newspapers and newspaper inserts containing coupons were the subject of dumpster diving.

=== Films ===
* &quot;Surfing the Waste: A Musical Documentary About Dumpster Diving&quot;, a film by Paul Aflalo, Sandra Lombardi and Tomoe Yoshihara, with music composed by Alden Penner and Nic Boshart.
* &quot;Dumpster Wars: Reno&#x27;s Trash Politics&quot; (2008)
* &quot;I Love Trash&quot; (2007), a 30-minute documentary by David Brown and Greg Mann. OCLC&#x27;s WorldCat provided a synopsis: &quot;&quot;I Love Trash&quot; is a documentary about the art of dumpster diving. Starting with an empty apartment, only the clothes they were wearing and a flashlight, David and Greg find everything they might otherwise buy, in trash cans and dumpsters. All their food, clothes, electronics, art materials and entertainment, all out of the trash.&quot; Accolades: Skyfest Film and Script Festival, (won 2nd place for Documentary Films); and Lake Michigan Film Competition, (won 3rd place for Documentary films).
* The 2010 documentary film &quot;Dive!&quot;, a short documentary written and directed by Jeremy Seifert, investigates dumpster diving in the Los Angeles area. &quot;Dive!&quot; premiered in October 2009 at the Gig Harbor Film Festival, where it won the Audience Choice Award. It has gone on to win awards at many other film festivals, including Best Documentary at the DC Independent Film Festival and Best Film at the Dutch Environmental Film Festival.
* &quot;Spoils: Extraordinary Harvest&quot;. A short film/mystery film and documentary by Alex Mallis. (2012) Accolades: Official Selection, New Orleans Film Festival. Official Selection, Independent Film Festival of Boston. Official Selection, DOC NYC.
* &quot;The Leftovers: A Documentary about People Who Eat Trash&quot; (2008), a 28-minute Swedish documentary by Michael Cavanagh and Kerstin Übelacker. Mykel Bently, Paul Hood, Krystal Trickey, Nick Gill, and Sofia Arborelius (the latter two were exchange students) joined for this dumpster diver adventure.
* &quot;From Dumpster To Dinner Plate&quot; (2011), an award-winning New Zealand short documentary directed by Vanessa Hudson. &quot;As the cost of food reaches record highs an underground movement of dumpster divers is rapidly gaining momentum fuelled by consumers who are forced to find creative ways to feed themselves.&quot;

<text>A digital synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to make musical sounds, in contrast to older analog synthesizers, which produce music using analog electronics, and samplers, which play back digital recordings of acoustic, electric, or electronic instruments. Some digital synthesizers emulate analog synthesizers, while others include sampling capability in addition to digital synthesis.

== History ==
The very earliest digital synthesis experiments were made with computers, as part of academic research into sound generation. 

In 1957, the first programming language for computer music, MUSIC, was developed by Max Mathews on an IBM 704 at Bell Labs in 1957. It generates digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis.

, EMS MUSYS 3 system was developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing) and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio. The system ran on two mini-computers, Digital Equipment PDP-8&#x27;s. These had a pair of fast D/A and A/D converters, 12,000 (12k) bytes of core memory (RAM), backed up by a hard drive of 32k and by tape storage (DecTape). The earliest digital sampling was done on that system during 1971–1972 for Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Chronometer&quot; released in 1975.

In 1972–1974, Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer was developed by Dartmouth College Professors Jon Appleton and Frederick J. Hooven, in association with NED co-founders Sydney A. Alonso and Cameron W. Jones.

In 1977, Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer was developed by Hal Ales at Bell Labs.

In 1977, New England Digital (NED) released the Synclavier, the first commercial synthesizer to use purely digital sound generation and also the world&#x27;s first commercial FM synthesizer.

Early commercial digital synthesizers used simple hard-wired digital circuitry to implement techniques such as additive synthesis and FM synthesis. Two other early commercial digital synthesizers were the Fairlight CMI, introduced in 1979, and the New England Digital Synclavier II, introduced in 1979 as an upgrade to the original Synclavier. The Fairlight CMI was the one of the earlier sampling synthesizers, while the Synclavier originally used FM synthesis technology licensed from Yamaha, before adding the world&#x27;s first 16-bit, real-time hard drive streaming sampler later in 1982. The Fairlight CMI and the Synclavier were both expensive systems, retailing for more than $20,000 in the early 1980s. The cost of digital synthesizers began falling rapidly in the early 1980s. E-mu Systems introduced the Emulator sampling synthesizer in 1982 at a retail price of $7,900. Although not as flexible or powerful as either the Fairlight CMI or the Synclavier, its lower cost and portability made it popular.
With the addition of sophisticated sequencers on board, now added to built-in effects and other features, the &#x27;workstation&#x27; synthesizer had been born. These always include a multi-track sequencer, and can often record and play back samples, and in later years full audio tracks, to be used to record an entire song. These are usually also ROMplers, playing back samples, to give a wide variety of realistic instrument and other sounds such as drums, string instruments and wind instruments to sequence and compose songs, along with popular keyboard instrument sounds such as electric pianos and organs.

As there was still interest in analog synthesizers, and with the increase of computing power, over the 1990s another type of synthesizer arose: the analog modeling, or &quot;virtual analog&quot; synthesizer. These use computing power to simulate traditional analog waveforms and circuitry such as envelopes and filters, with the most popular examples of this type of instrument including the Nord Lead and Access Virus.

Digital synthesizers can now be completely emulated in software (&quot;softsynth&quot;), and run on conventional PC hardware. Such soft implementations require careful programming and a fast CPU to get the same latency response as their dedicated equivalents. To reduce latency, some professional sound card manufacturers have developed specialized Digital Signal Processing ([DSP]) hardware. Dedicated digital synthesizers have the advantage of a performance-friendly user interface (physical controls like buttons for selecting features and enabling functionality, and knobs for setting variable parameters). On the other hand, software synthesizers have the advantages afforded by a rich graphical display.

With focus on performance-oriented keyboards and digital computer technology, manufacturers of commercial electronic instruments created some of the earliest digital synthesizers for studio and experimental use with computers being able to handle built-in sound synthesis algorithms.

=== In Japan ===

In 1973, the Japanese company Yamaha licensed the patent for frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis) from John Chowning, who had experimented with it at Stanford University since 1971. Yamaha&#x27;s engineers began adapting Chowning&#x27;s algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the &quot;key scaling&quot; method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation, though it would take several years before Yamaha were to release their FM digital synthesizers. In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company&#x27;s former name &quot;Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha&quot;, evolving Chowning&#x27;s early work on FM synthesis technology. Yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974.

Released in 1979, the Casio VL-1 was the first low budget digital synthesizer, selling for $69.95. Yamaha eventually commercialized their FM synthesis technology and released the company&#x27;s first FM digital synthesizer in 1980, the Yamaha GS-1, but at an expensive retail price of $16,000.

Introduced in 1983, the Yamaha DX7 was the breakthrough digital synthesizer to have a major impact, both innovative and affordable, and thus spelling the decline of analog synthesizers. It used FM synthesis and, although it was incapable of the sampling synthesis of the Fairlight CMI, its price was around $2,000, putting it within range of a much larger number of musicians. The DX-7 was also known for its &quot;key scaling&quot; method to avoid distortion and for its recognizably bright tonality that was partly due to its high sampling rate of 57 kHz. It became indispensable to many music artists of the 1980s, and would become one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time.

In 1987, Roland released its own influential synthesizer of the time, the D-50. This popular synth broke new ground in affordably combining short samples and digital oscillators, as well as the innovation of built-in digital effects (reverb., chorus, equalizer). Roland called this Linear Arithmetic (LA) synthesis. This instrument is responsible for some of the very recognisable preset synthesizer sounds of the late 1980s, such as the Pizzagogo sound used on Enya&#x27;s &quot;Orinoco Flow.&quot;

It gradually became feasible to include high quality samples of existing instruments as opposed to synthesizing them. In 1988, Korg introduced the last of the hugely popular trio of digital synthesizers of the 1980s after the DX7 and D50, the M1. This heralded both the increasing popularisation of digital sample-based synthesis, and the rise of &#x27;workstation&#x27; synthesizers. After this time, many popular modern digital synthesizers have been described as not being full synthesizers in the most precise sense, as they play back samples stored in their memory. However, they still include options to shape the sounds through use of envelopes, LFOs, filters and effects such as reverb. The Yamaha Motif and Roland Fantom series of keyboards are typical examples of this type, described as &#x27;ROMplers&#x27;; at the same time, they are also examples of &quot;workstation&quot; synthesizers.

As the cost of processing power and memory fell, new types of synthesizers emerged, offering a variety of novel sound synthesis options. The Korg Oasys was one such example, packaging multiple digital synthesizers into a single unit.

== Analog vs. digital ==

An analog synthesizer creates sound using electronic circuitry, such as voltage-controlled oscillators and voltage-controlled filters. In contrast, a digital synthesizer generates a stream of numbers, often using some form of digital signal processor, which are then converted to sound using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

A digital synthesizer is in essence a computer with (often) a piano or organ keyboard and an LCD as a user interface. Because computer technology is rapidly advancing, it is often possible to offer more features in a digital synthesizer than in an analog synthesizer at a given price. However, both technologies have their own merit. Some forms of synthesis, such as, for instance, sampling and additive synthesis are not feasible in analog synthesizers, while on the other hand, many musicians prefer the character of analog synthesizers over their digital equivalent.

== Usage ==
The new wave era of the 1980s first brought the digital synthesizer to the public ear. Bands like Talking Heads and Duran Duran used the digitally made sounds on some of their most popular albums. Other more pop-inspired bands like Hall &amp; Oates began incorporating the digital synthesizer into their sound in the 1980s. Through breakthroughs in technology in the 1990s many modern synthesizers use DSP.

== Digital synthesis ==

Working in more or less the same way, every digital synthesizer appears similar to a computer. At a steady sample rate, digital synthesis produces a stream of numbers. Sound from speakers is then produced by a conversion to analog form. Direct digital synthesis is the typical architecture for digital synthesizers. Through signal generation, voice and instrument-level processing, a signal flow is created and controlled either by MIDI capabilities or voice and instrument-level controls.

<doc id="8249" wikidata="Q5251607" url="?curid=8249" title="Definition of music">
<text>A definition of music endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music&#x27;s basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of defining what is meant by the term &quot;music&quot;. Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined, and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as &quot;organized sound,&quot; but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as human speech and sounds found in both natural and industrial environments . The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of culture in music cognition.

The &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot; defines music as &quot;the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion&quot;. However, some music genres, such as noise music and musique concrète, challenge these ideas by using sounds not widely considered as musical, beautiful or harmonious, like randomly produced electronic distortion, feedback, static, cacophony, and sounds produced using compositional processes which utilize indeterminacy.

An often-cited example of the dilemma in defining music is the work &quot;4′33″&quot; (1952) by the American composer John Cage (1912–1992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound throughout the duration of the piece, marking sections and the end by gesture. The audience hears only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue that &quot;4′33″&quot; is not music because, among other reasons, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered &quot;musical&quot; and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard. Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form.

==Concepts of music==
Because of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as &quot;music&quot; as that word is generally understood by Western cultures. Inuit and most North American Indian languages do not have a general term for music. Among the Aztecs, the ancient Mexican theory of rhetoric, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the Nahuatl term &quot;In xochitl-in kwikatl&quot; to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserved the word &quot;Kwikakayotl&quot; (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions. There is no term for music in Nigerian languages Tiv, Yoruba, Igbo, Efik, Birom, Hausa, Idoma, Eggon or Jarawa. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term &quot;music&quot;.() The Mapuche of Argentina do not have a word for &quot;music&quot;, but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (&quot;kantun&quot;), European and non-Mapuche music (&quot;kantun winka&quot;), ceremonial songs (&quot;öl&quot;), and &quot;tayil&quot;.

While some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music.() &quot;Musiqi&quot; is the Persian word for the science and art of music, &quot;muzik&quot; being the sound and performance of music,() though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as Quran chanting, are excluded.

==Music vs. noise==
Ben Watson points out that Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Große Fuge&quot; (1825) &quot;sounded like noise&quot; to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven&#x27;s publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling &quot;Allegro&quot;. They subsequently published it separately. Musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that &quot;The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no &quot;single&quot; and &quot;intercultural&quot; universal concept defining what music might be&quot;.

==Definitions==

===Organized sound===

An often-cited definition of music is that it is &quot;organized sound&quot;, a term originally coined by modernist composer Edgard Varèse in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Varèse&#x27;s concept of music as &quot;organized sound&quot; fits into his vision of &quot;sound as living matter&quot; and of &quot;musical space as open rather than bounded&quot;. He conceived the elements of his music in terms of &quot;sound-masses&quot;, likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of crystallization. Varèse thought that &quot;to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise&quot;, and he posed the question, &quot;what is music but organized noises?&quot;

The fifteenth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that &quot;while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit.&quot; A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as &quot;musical&quot;, but perhaps less often as &quot;music&quot;). The composer R. Murray states that the sound of classical music &quot;has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any &#x27;cultural&#x27; musicality.&quot; However, in the view of semiologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez, &quot;just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both&quot;. (See &quot;music as social construct&quot; below.)

====Language====

Levi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method, comparable to mathematics.

===Musical universals===

Most definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: pitch, timbre, loudness, duration, spatial location and texture.). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following Wittgenstein, cognitive psychologist Eleanor Rosch proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category. As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition. This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English-language writers refer to as music.

===Social construct===

Many people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: &quot;the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity&quot; (&quot;Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, online edition).

===Subjective experience===
This approach to the definition focuses not on the &quot;construction&quot; but on the &quot;experience&quot; of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the Italian composer Luciano Berio: &quot;Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music&quot;. This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as non-music if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound&#x27;s &quot;essence&quot; &quot;as music&quot;.

==Specific definitions==

===Clifton===
In his 1983 book, &quot;Music as Heard&quot;, which sets out from the phenomenological position of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Ricœur, Thomas Clifton defines music as &quot;an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is presentative rather than denotative ... This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects.&quot; More precisely, &quot;music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism&quot;. It is therefore &quot;a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object&quot;.

Clifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: &quot;a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced.&quot; However, &quot;It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening &quot;to&quot; the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition &#x27;to&#x27; puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds&quot;.

In this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. &quot;It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word &quot;ordered&quot; in this definition of music&quot;. This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme relativism, since &quot;it is precisely the &#x27;subjective&#x27; aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in &#x27;objective,&#x27; scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like seeing pink elephants, and that reporting about such an experience need not be subjective in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion&quot;.

Clifton&#x27;s task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called &quot;phenomena&quot;, and the activity of describing phenomena is called &quot;phenomenology&quot;. It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards.
Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. ... To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. ... Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. ... Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful.

===Nattiez===
&quot;Music, often an art/entertainment, is a total social fact whose definitions vary according to era and culture&quot;, according to Jean Molino. It is often contrasted with noise. According to musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez: &quot;The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no &quot;single&quot; and &quot;intercultural&quot; universal concept defining what music might be&quot;. Given the above demonstration that &quot;there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical&quot;, an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.

Nattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a semiological scheme similar to the following:
There are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:
*&quot; By &#x27;poietic&#x27; I understand describing the &quot;link&quot; among the composer&#x27;s intentions, his creative procedures, his mental schemas, and the &quot;result&quot; of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work&#x27;s material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it &#x27;the interior ear&#x27;): what the composer hears while imagining the work&#x27;s sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape.&quot;
*&quot;By &#x27;esthesic&#x27; I understand not merely the artificially attentive hearing of a musicologist, but the description of perceptive behaviors within a given population of listeners; that is how this or that aspect of sonorous reality is captured by their perceptive strategies&quot;.
*The neutral level is that of the physical &quot;trace&quot;, (Saussere&#x27;s sound-image, a sonority, a score), created and interpreted by the esthesic level (which corresponds to a perceptive definition; the perceptive and/or &quot;social&quot; construction definitions below) and the poietic level (which corresponds to a creative, as in compositional, definition; the organizational and social construction definitions below).

Table describing types of definitions of music:
Because of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and vibration or acoustics, the cognitive study of music, the study of music theory and performance practice or music theory and ethnomusicology and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called musicology.

===Xenakis===
Composer Iannis Xenakis in &quot;Towards a Metamusic&quot; (chapter 7 of &quot;Formalized Music&quot;) defined music in the following way:
#It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.
#It is an individual pleroma, a realization.
#It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, ..., arguments)
#It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.
#It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.
#It is the gratuitous play of a child.
#It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.
