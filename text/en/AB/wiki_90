<text>An electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of electrons as a source of illumination. They use electron optics that are analogous to the glass lenses of an optical light microscope to control the electron beam, for instance focusing them to produce magnified images or electron diffraction patterns. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times smaller than that of visible light, electron microscopes have a much higher resolution of about 0.1 nm, which compares to about 200 nm for light microscopes. &quot;Electron microscope&quot; may refer to:
*Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) where swift electrons go through a thin sample
*Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) which is similar to TEM with a scanned electron probe
*Scanning electron microscope (SEM) which is similar to STEM, but with thick samples
*Electron microprobe similar to a SEM, but more for chemical analysis
*Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM), used to image surfaces
*Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) which is similar to LEEM using electrons emitted from surfaces by photons

== History ==
Many developments laid the groundwork of the electron optics used in microscopes. One significant step was the work of Hertz in 1883 who made a cathode-ray tube with electrostatic and magnetic deflection, demonstrating manipulation of the direction of an electron beam. Others were focusing of the electrons by an axial magnetic field by Emil Wiechert in 1899, improved oxide-coated cathodes which produced more electrons by Arthur Wehnelt in 1905 and the development of the electromagnetic lens in 1926 by Hans Busch. According to Dennis Gabor, the physicist Leó Szilárd tried in 1928 to convince him to build an electron microscope, for which Szilárd had filed a patent.

To this day the issue of who invented the transmission electron microscope is controversial. In 1928, at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), Adolf Matthias (Professor of High Voltage Technology and Electrical Installations) appointed Max Knoll to lead a team of researchers to advance research on electron beams and cathode-ray oscilloscopes. The team consisted of several PhD students including Ernst Ruska. In 1931, Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over an anode aperture. The device, a replicate of which is shown in the figure, used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, the first electron microscope. (Max Knoll died in 1969, so did not receive a share of the 1986 Nobel prize for the invention of electron microscopes.)

Apparently independent of this effort was work at Siemens-Schuckert by Reinhold Rüdenberg. According to patent law (U.S. Patent No. 2058914 and 2070318, both filed in 1932), he is the inventor of the electron microscope, but it is not clear when he had a working instrument. He stated in a very brief article in 1932 that Siemens had been working on this for some years before the patents were filed in 1932, claiming that his effort was parallel to the university development. He died in 1961, so similar to Max Knoll, was not eligible for a share of the 1986 Nobel prize.

In the following year, 1933, Ruska and Knoll built the first electron microscope that exceeded the resolution of an optical (light) microscope. Four years later, in 1937, Siemens financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska, Ernst&#x27;s brother, to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the scanning electron microscope. Siemens produced the first commercial electron microscope in 1938. The first North American electron microscopes were constructed in the 1930s, at the Washington State University by Anderson and Fitzsimmons and at the University of Toronto by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus. Siemens produced a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1939. Although current transmission electron microscopes are capable of two million times magnification, as scientific instruments they remain similar but with improved optics.

In the 1940s, high-resolution electron microscopes were developed, enabling greater magnification and resolution. By 1965, Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago introduced the scanning transmission electron microscope using a field emission source, enabling scanning microscopes at high resolution. By the early 1980s improvements in mechanical stability as well as the use of higher accelerating voltages enabled imaging of materials at the atomic scale. In the 1980s, the field emission gun became common for electron microscopes, improving the image quality due to the additional coherence and lower chromatic aberrations. The 2000s were marked by advancements in aberration-corrected electron microscopy, allowing for significant improvements in resolution and clarity of images.

== Types ==

=== Transmission electron microscope (TEM) ===
The original form of the electron microscope, the transmission electron microscope (TEM), uses a high voltage electron beam to illuminate the specimen and create an image. An electron beam is produced by an electron gun, with the electrons typically having energies in the range 20 to 400 keV, focused by electromagnetic lenses, and transmitted through the specimen. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by lenses of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the &quot;image&quot;) may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a detector. For example, the image may be viewed directly by an operator using a fluorescent viewing screen coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide. A high-resolution phosphor may also be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a fibre optic light-guide to the sensor of a digital camera. Direct electron detectors have no scintillator and are directly exposed to the electron beam, which addresses some of the limitations of scintillator-coupled cameras.

The resolution of TEMs is limited primarily by spherical aberration, but a new generation of hardware correctors can reduce spherical aberration to increase the resolution in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to below 0.5 angstrom (50 picometres), enabling magnifications above 50 million times. The ability of HRTEM to determine the positions of atoms within materials is useful for nano-technologies research and development.

=== Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) ===

The STEM rasters a focused incident probe across a specimen. The high resolution of the TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies annular dark-field imaging, and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion.

=== Scanning electron microscope (SEM) ===

The SEM produces images by probing the specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across the specimen (raster scanning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy by a variety of mechanisms. These interactions lead to, among other events, emission of low-energy secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission (cathodoluminescence) or X-ray emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by SEM represents the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated.

SEMs are different from TEMs in that they use electrons with much lower energy, generally below 20 keV, while TEMs generally use electrons with energies in the range of 80-300 keV. Thus, the electron sources and optics of the two microscopes have different designs, and they are normally separate instruments.

== Main operating modes ==
The most common methods of obtaining images in an electron microscope involve selecting different directions for the electrons that have been transmitted through a sample, and/or electrons of different energies. There are a very large number of methods, although not all are very common.

=== Diffraction contrast imaging ===
Diffraction contrast uses the variation in either or both the direction of diffracted electrons or their amplitude as a function of position as the contrast mechanism. It is one of the simplest ways to image in a transmission electron microscope, and widely used.

The idea is to use an objective aperture below the sample and select only one or a range of different diffracted directions, then use these to form an image. When the aperture includes the incident beam direction the images are called &quot;bright field&quot;, since in the absence of any sample the field of view would be uniformly bright. When the aperture excludes the incident beam the images are called &quot;dark field&quot;, since similarly without a sample the image would be uniformly dark.

=== High resolution imaging ===
In high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (also sometimes called high-resolution electron microscopy) a number of different diffracted beams are allowed through the objective aperture. These interfere, leading to images which represent the atomic structure of the material. These can include the incident beam direction, or with scanning transmission electron microscopes they typically are for a range of diffracted beams excluding the incident beam. Depending upon how thick the samples are and the aberrations of the microscope these images can either be directly interpreted in terms of the positions of columns of atoms, or require a more careful analysis using calculations of the multiple scattering of the electrons and the effect of the contrast transfer function of the microscope.
=== X-ray microanalysis ===
X-ray microanalysis is a method of obtaining local chemical information within electron microscopes or all types, although it is most commonly used in scanning instruments. When high energy electrons interact with atoms they can knock out electrons, particularly those in the inner shells and core electrons. These are then filled by valence electron, and the energy difference between the valence and core states can be converted into an x-ray which is detected by a spectrometer. The energies of these x-rays is somewhat specific to the atomic species, so local chemistry can be probed. 
=== EELS ===

Similar to X-ray microanalysis, the energies of electrons which have transmitted through a sample can be analyzed and yield information ranging from details of the local electronic structure to chemical information.

=== Electron diffraction ===

Transmission electron microscopes can be used in electron diffraction mode where a map of the angles of the electrons leaving the sample is produced. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are primarily in the size of the crystals. In X-ray crystallography, crystals are commonly visible by the naked eye and are generally in the hundreds of micrometers in length. In comparison, crystals for electron diffraction must be less than a few hundred nanometers in thickness, and have no lower boundary of size. Additionally, electron diffraction is done on a TEM, which can also be used to obtain many other types of information, rather than requiring a separate instrument.

== Sample preparation ==
Samples for electron microscopes mostly cannot be observed directly. The samples need to be prepared to stabilize the sample and enhance contrast. Preparation techniques differ vastly in respect to the sample and its specific qualities to be observed as well as the specific microscope used.

=== Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) ===

To prevent charging and enhance the signal in SEM, non-conductive samples (e.g. biological samples as in figure) can be sputter-coated in a thin film of metal.

=== Transmission electron microscope ===
Materials to be viewed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) may require processing to produce a suitable sample. The technique required varies depending on the specimen and the analysis required:
* &quot;Chemical fixation&quot; – for biological specimens this aims to stabilize the specimen&#x27;s mobile macromolecular structure by chemical crosslinking of proteins with aldehydes such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and lipids with osmium tetroxide.
* &quot;Cryofixation&quot; – freezing a specimen so that the water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its native state. Methods to achieve this vitrification include plunge freezing rapidly in liquid ethane, and high pressure freezing. An entire field called cryo-electron microscopy has branched from this technique. With the development of cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) and cryo-focused ion beam milling of lamellae, it is now possible to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.
* &quot;Dehydration&quot; – replacement of water with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, followed by critical point drying or infiltration with embedding resins. See also freeze drying.
* &quot;Embedding, biological specimens&quot; – after dehydration, tissue for observation in the transmission electron microscope is embedded so it can be sectioned ready for viewing. To do this the tissue is passed through a &#x27;transition solvent&#x27; such as propylene oxide (epoxypropane) or acetone and then infiltrated with an epoxy resin such as Araldite, Epon, or Durcupan; tissues may also be embedded directly in water-miscible acrylic resin. After the resin has been polymerized (hardened) the sample is sectioned by ultramicrotomy and stained.
* &quot;Embedding, materials&quot; – after embedding in resin, the specimen is usually ground and polished to a mirror-like finish using ultra-fine abrasives.
* &quot;Freeze-fracture or freeze-etch&quot; – a preparation method particularly useful for examining lipid membranes and their incorporated proteins in &quot;face on&quot; view. The fresh tissue or cell suspension is frozen rapidly (cryofixation), then fractured by breaking (or by using a microtome) while maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature. The cold fractured surface (sometimes &quot;etched&quot; by increasing the temperature to about −100 °C for several minutes to let some ice sublime) is then shadowed with evaporated platinum or gold at an average angle of 45° in a high vacuum evaporator. The second coat of carbon, evaporated perpendicular to the average surface plane is often performed to improve the stability of the replica coating. The specimen is returned to room temperature and pressure, then the extremely fragile &quot;pre-shadowed&quot; metal replica of the fracture surface is released from the underlying biological material by careful chemical digestion with acids, hypochlorite solution or SDS detergent. The still-floating replica is thoroughly washed free from residual chemicals, carefully fished up on fine grids, dried then viewed in the TEM.
* &quot;Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling (FRIL)&quot; – the freeze-fracture method has been modified to allow the identification of the components of the fracture face by immunogold labeling. Instead of removing all the underlying tissue of the thawed replica as the final step before viewing in the microscope the tissue thickness is minimized during or after the fracture process. The thin layer of tissue remains bound to the metal replica so it can be immunogold labeled with antibodies to the structures of choice. The thin layer of the original specimen on the replica with gold attached allows the identification of structures in the fracture plane. There are also related methods which label the surface of etched cells and other replica labeling variations.
* &quot;Ion beam milling&quot; – thins samples until they are transparent to electrons by firing ions (typically argon) at the surface from an angle and sputtering material from the surface. A subclass of this is focused ion beam milling, where gallium ions are used to produce an electron transparent membrane or &#x27;lamella&#x27; in a specific region of the sample, for example through a device within a microprocessor or a focused ion beam SEM. Ion beam milling may also be used for cross-section polishing prior to analysis of materials that are difficult to prepare using mechanical polishing.
* &quot;Negative stain&quot; – suspensions containing nanoparticles or fine biological material (such as viruses and bacteria) are briefly mixed with a dilute solution of an electron-opaque solution such as ammonium molybdate, uranyl acetate (or formate), or phosphotungstic acid. This mixture is applied to an EM grid, pre-coated with a plastic film such as formvar, blotted, then allowed to dry. Viewing of this preparation in the TEM should be carried out without delay for best results. The method is important in microbiology for fast but crude morphological identification, but can also be used as the basis for high-resolution 3D reconstruction using EM tomography methodology when carbon films are used for support. 
* &quot;Sectioning&quot; – produces thin slices of the specimen, semitransparent to electrons. These can be cut using ultramicrotomy on an ultramicrotome with a glass or diamond knife to produce ultra-thin sections about 60–90 nm thick. Disposable glass knives are also used because they can be made in the lab and are much cheaper. Sections can also be created in situ by milling in a focused ion beam SEM, where the section is known as a lamella.
* &quot;Staining&quot; – uses heavy metals such as lead, uranium or tungsten to scatter imaging electrons and thus give contrast between different structures, since many (especially biological) materials are nearly &quot;transparent&quot; to electrons (weak phase objects). In biology, specimens can be stained &quot;en bloc&quot; before embedding and also later after sectioning. Typically thin sections are stained for several minutes with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of uranyl acetate followed by aqueous lead citrate.

== EM workflows ==
In their most common configurations, electron microscopes produce images with a single brightness value per pixel, with the results usually rendered in greyscale. However, often these images are then colourized through the use of feature-detection software, or simply by hand-editing using a graphics editor. This may be done to clarify structure or for aesthetic effect and generally does not add new information about the specimen.

Electron microscopes are now frequently used in more complex workflows, with each workflow typically using multiple technologies to enable more complex and/or more quantitative analyses of a sample. A few examples are outlined below, but this should not be considered an exhaustive list. The choice of workflow will be highly dependent on the application and the requirements of the corresponding scientific questions, such as resolution, volume, nature of the target molecule, etc.

For example, images from light and electron microscopy of the same region of a sample can be overlaid to correlate the data from the two modalities. This is commonly used to provide higher resolution contextual EM information about a fluorescently labelled structure. This correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is one of a range of correlative workflows now available. Another example is high resolution mass spectrometry (ion microscopy), which has been used to provide correlative information about subcellular antibiotic localisation, data that would be difficult to obtain by other means.

The initial role of electron microscopes in imaging two-dimensional slices (TEM) or a specimen surface (SEM with secondary electrons) has also increasingly expanded into the depth of samples. An early example of these ‘volume EM’ workflows was simply to stack TEM images of serial sections cut through a sample. The next development was virtual reconstruction of a thick section (200-500 nm) volume by backprojection of a set of images taken at different tilt angles - TEM tomography.

=== Serial imaging for volume EM ===
To acquire volume EM datasets of larger depths than TEM tomography (micrometers or millimeters in the z axis), a series of images taken through the sample depth can be used. For example, ribbons of serial sections can be imaged in a TEM as described above, and when thicker sections are used, serial TEM tomography can be used to increase the z-resolution. More recently, back scattered electron (BSE) images can be acquired of a larger series of sections collected on silicon wafers, known as SEM array tomography. An alternative approach is to use BSE SEM to image the block surface instead of the section, after each section has been removed. By this method, an ultramicrotome installed in an SEM chamber can increase automation of the workflow; the specimen block is loaded in the chamber and the system programmed to continuously cut and image through the sample. This is known as serial block face SEM. A related method uses focused ion beam milling instead of an ultramicrotome to remove sections. In these serial imaging methods, the output is essentially a sequence of images through a specimen block that can be digitally aligned in sequence and thus reconstructed into a volume EM dataset. The increased volume available in these methods has expanded the capability of electron microscopy to address new questions, such as mapping neural connectivity in the brain, and membrane contact sites between organelles.

== Disadvantages ==
Electron microscopes are expensive to build and maintain. Microscopes designed to achieve high resolutions must be housed in stable buildings (sometimes underground) with special services such as magnetic field canceling systems.

The samples largely have to be viewed in vacuum, as the molecules that make up air would scatter the electrons. An exception is liquid-phase electron microscopy using either a closed liquid cell or an environmental chamber, for example, in the environmental scanning electron microscope, which allows hydrated samples to be viewed in a low-pressure (up to ) wet environment. Various techniques for in situ electron microscopy of gaseous samples have been developed.

Scanning electron microscopes operating in conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible the observation of non-conductive specimens without coating. Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.

Small, stable specimens such as carbon nanotubes, diatom frustules and small mineral crystals (asbestos fibres, for example) require no special treatment before being examined in the electron microscope. Samples of hydrated materials, including almost all biological specimens, have to be prepared in various ways to stabilize them, reduce their thickness (ultrathin sectioning) and increase their electron optical contrast (staining). These processes may result in &quot;artifacts&quot;, but these can usually be identified by comparing the results obtained by using radically different specimen preparation methods. Since the 1980s, analysis of cryofixed, vitrified specimens has also become increasingly used by scientists, further confirming the validity of this technique.

<doc id="9731" wikidata="Q1059748" url="?curid=9731" title="List of extinct bird species since 1500">
<text>About 216 species of birds have become extinct since 1500, with increasing extinction rates due to human-caused influences such as habitat loss, the introduction of invasive species, and climate change. Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with over 1,480 at risk of extinction and 223 critically endangered.

Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived, and Guam, which lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the decades following the introduction of the brown tree snake (&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot;). The disproportionate number of extinctions in rails reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists.

The extinction dates given below are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken), which are approximations of the actual date of extinction. For many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European colonization, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over 100 years, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists. In certain unusual cases, it is possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day; the San Benedicto rock wren represents an extreme example where its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour coinciding with the eruption of Bárcena.

The year 1500 serves as one common threshold of the &quot;modern&quot; era in which species are described scientifically, extinctions are monitored, and globalization has led to increased pressure on species. Taxa which became extinct pre-1500 are listed in List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species; prominent examples include the elephant birds (&quot;Aepyornis)&quot; and moa.

==Extinct bird species==
===Paleognathes===

====Apterygiformes====
The kiwis of New Zealand
* West Coast spotted kiwi, &quot;Apteryx occidentalis&quot; (South Island, New Zealand, c. 1900)

===Anseriformes===

Ducks, geese and swans

* Anatidaeducks, geese and swans
** Anatinaeducks
*** Tadornini
**** Extinct species of extant genera
***** Tadorna – shelducks
****** Crested shelduck, &quot;Tadorna cristata&quot; (Northeast Asia, 1964)
******:A likely relict species from Northeast Asia. Officially critically endangered due to unconfirmed reports made between 1985 and 1990 and poor survey coverage of the regions.
***** Alopochen

*** Merginisea ducks
**** †Camptorhynchus – Labrador duck
***** Labrador duck, &quot;Camptorhynchus labradorius&quot; (northeastern North America, c. 1878)Possibly a relict species. Causes of extinction are poorly known, but at least partly driven by hunting.
**** Extinct species of extant genera
***** Mergus – mergansers
****** Auckland Island merganser, &quot;Mergus australis&quot; (New Zealand and the Auckland Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1902) Driven to extinction by predation by introduced mammals and hunting.
*** Aythyinidiving ducks
**** Extinct species of extant genera
***** Chenonetta
****** Finsch&#x27;s duck, &quot;Chenonetta finschi&quot; (New Zealand, c. 1760)

***** Rhodonessa – pink-headed duck
****** Pink-headed duck, &quot;Rhodonessa caryophyllacea&quot; (East India, Bangladesh, North Myanmar, c. 1945)sometimes included in genus &quot;Netta&quot;, but this classification is not generally accepted.
******:Population declined sharply in early 20th century due to habitat loss and hunting. Officially classified as critically endangered due to the possibility of remaining individuals in remote portions of northern Myanmar, where unconfirmed reports have continued into the 21st century.
***** Aythya
****** Réunion pochard, &quot;Aythya&quot; cf. &quot;innotata&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, 17th century)
******:Undescribed extinct species only known from two subfossils and two historical reports (1687, 1710) of non-Mascarene teal ducks on Réunion.
*** Anatinidabbling ducks
**** Extinct species of extant genera
***** Mareca – wigeons
****** Amsterdam wigeon, &quot;Mareca marecula&quot; (Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, 1793) Driven to extinction by habitat destruction, hunting, and the introduction of invasive species.
***** Anas
****** Saint Paul Island duck, &quot;Anas&quot; sp. (St. Paul Island, South Indian Ocean, c. 1800)
******: Only known by a single report from 1793. May be synonymous with the Amsterdam wigeon or a distinct species or subspecies.
****** Mascarene teal, &quot;Anas theodori&quot; (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, 1710) Extinction caused by rapid habitat loss, hunting, and introduction of invasive species.
****** Mariana mallard, &quot;Anas oustaleti&quot; (Marianas, West Pacific, 1981) – often considered a subspecies of the mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;) or a hybrid with the Pacific black duck (&quot;Anas superciliosa&quot;) Hunting and habitat loss were both responsible for extinction. Captive breeding conservation efforts were unsuccessful.

===Galliformes===

Quails and relatives
See also Bokaak &quot;bustard&quot; under Gruiformes below
**Megapodiidaemegapodes
*** Extinct species of extant genera
**** Megapodius 
***** Pile-builder megapode, &quot;Megapodius molistructor&quot; (New Caledonia, late 18th century?) 
*****:May have survived to the late 18th century, as evidenced by descriptions of the bird named &quot;Tetrao australis&quot; and later &quot;Megapodius andersoni&quot;. Extinction likely driven by hunting.
***** Viti Levu scrubfowl, &quot;Megapodius amissus&quot; (Viti Levu and possibly Kadavu, Fiji, 20th century?) 
*****:Only concretely known from subfossils dating 2900-2700 years before present. Likely driven to extinction by hunting. Unconfirmed sightings from the 20th century.
***** Raoul Island scrubfowl, &quot;Megapodius&quot; sp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 1876)
*****:A hypothetical species said to have inhabited Raoul Island until the population was wiped out in a volcanic eruption. It is not clear whether the birds represent a distinct taxon.

**Phasianidaepheasants and allies
*** Extinct species of extant genera
**** Coturnix 
***** New Zealand quail, &quot;Coturnix novaezelandiae&quot; (New Zealand, 1875) Causes of extinction involved introduced diseases, competition with invasive species, and agricultural burning.
**** Ophrysia 
***** Himalayan quail, &quot;Ophrysia superciliosa&quot; (North India, late 19th century)
*****:Last confirmed sighting in 1876. Officially critically endangered due to ongoing unconfirmed sightings and sparse survey coverage in the historical range. Reasons for decline and possible extinction not well known, but may include hunting and habitat destruction.

===Podicipediformes===
Grebes
* Extinct species of extant genera
** Tachybaptus 
***Alaotra grebe, &quot;Tachybaptus rufolavatus&quot; (Lake Alaotra and surrounding lakes, Madagascar, 1985)
*:Officially declared extinct in 2010, 25 years after the last official sighting in 1985. Its extinction was primarily due to habitat destruction, the introduction of invasive and hybridisation with the little grebe (&quot;Tachybaptus ruficollis&quot;).
** Podilymbus 
*** Atitlán grebe, &quot;Podilymbus gigas&quot; (Lake Atitlán, Guatemala, 1989) Extinction driven by habitat destruction, an earthquake-driven drop in lake level in 1976, and hybridization with the Pied-billed grebe (&quot;Podilymbus podiceps).&quot;
** Podiceps 
*** Colombian grebe, &quot;Podiceps andinus&quot; (Bogotá area, Colombia, 1977) Population rapidly declined beginning in the 1950s due to factors including habitat destruction, the introduction of carnivorous trout, hunting, and water pollution. Extensive surveys in the 1980s failed to observe any individuals.

===Charadriiformes===

Shorebirds, gulls and auks

*Haematopodidaeoystercatchers
** Canary Islands oystercatcher, &quot;Haematopus meadewaldoi&quot; (eastern Canary Islands, East Atlantic, c. 1940s)
**:Last confirmed sighting from 1913, reported extinct in 1940s. Repeated surveys in the 20th century failed to locate any evidence of the species. Extinction likely driven by overharvesting by humans of intertidal zone, habitat destruction, and introduced predators.
*Charadriidaeplovers and lapwings
** Javan lapwing, &quot;Vanellus macropterus&quot; (Java, Indonesia, mid-20th century)
**:Last recorded in 1940. Officially classified as critically endangered due to incomplete survey coverage in suitable habitat and unconfirmed sightings continuing into the early 21st century. Decline and possible extinction driven by hunting and habitat destruction.

*Scolopacidaesandpipers and allies
** Eskimo curlew, &quot;Numenius borealis&quot; (northern North America, late 20th century?)
**:May still be extant; officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
** Slender-billed curlew, &quot;Numenius tenuirostris&quot; (Western Siberia, early in the first decade of the 21st century?)
**:May still exist; officially classified as critically endangered. A few birds were recorded in 2004 following several decades of increasing rarity. There was also an unconfirmed sighting in Albania in 2007. A survey to find out whether this bird still exists is currently being undertaken by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (BirdLife in the UK).
**Christmas sandpiper, &quot;Prosobonia cancellata&quot; (Kiritimati Island, Kiribati, Central Pacific, 1850s)
** Tahiti sandpiper, &quot;Prosobonia leucoptera&quot; (Tahiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, 19th century)
** Moorea sandpiper, &quot;Prosobonia ellisi&quot; (Moorea, Society Islands, South Pacific, 19th century)

Rails and allies - probably paraphyletic
* †&quot;Nesotrochis&quot;
** Antillean cave rail, &quot;Nesotrochis debooyi&quot;
*:Known by pre-Columbian bones from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Stories of an easy-to-catch bird named the &quot;carrao&quot; heard by Alexander Wetmore in 1912 on Puerto Rico may refer to this bird.
* †&quot;Diaphorapteryx&quot;
** Hawkins&#x27;s rail, &quot;Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, late 19th century)
* †&quot;Aphanapteryx&quot;
** Red rail, &quot;Aphanapteryx bonasia&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)

* Dieffenbach&#x27;s rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia dieffenbachii&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, mid-19th century)
* Tahiti rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia pacificus&quot; (Tahiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, late 18th19th century)
* Wake Island rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia wakensis&quot; (Wake Island, Micronesia, 1945)
* Vavau rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia vavauensis&quot; (Vavau, Tonga, Southwest Pacific, early 19th century?)
*:This bird was previously known only from a drawing from the 1793 Malaspina expedition, apparently depicting a species of &quot;Gallirallus&quot;. Subfossil remains belonging to this species were found in 2020.
* Eua rail, &quot;Gallirallus vekamatolu&quot;
*:Known from prehistoric bones found on Eua. It was probably a close relative of the Vava&#x27;u rail.
* Tongatapu rail, &quot;Gallirallus hypoleucus&quot; (Tongatapu, Tonga, Southwest Pacific, late 18th or 19th century)
* Hiva Oa rail, &quot;Gallirallus&quot; sp.
* Norfolk Island rail, &quot;Gallirallus&quot; sp. (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, early 17th century?)
*:May be the bird shown on a bad watercolor illustration made about 1800.
* Chatham rail, &quot;Cabalus modestus&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1900)
* New Caledonian rail, &quot;Cabalus lafresnanayanus&quot; (New Caledonia, Melanesia, c. 1900?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, the last records were in 1984 and it seems as if all of the available habitat has now been overrun by feral pigs and feral dogs, which preyed on this bird.
* Ascension crake, &quot;Mundia elpenor&quot; (Ascension Island, South Atlantic, late 17th century)formerly &quot;Atlantisia&quot;
* Saint Helena crake, &quot;Zapornia astrictocarpus&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Laysan rail, &quot;Zapornia palmeri&quot; (Laysan, Hawaiian Islands, 1944)
* Hawaiian rail, &quot;Zapornia sandwichensis&quot; (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1890)
* Kosrae crake, &quot;Zapornia monasa&quot; (Kosrae, Carolines, c. mid-to-late 19th century)
* Tahiti crake, &quot;Zapornia nigra&quot; (Tahiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, c. 1800)
*:Known only from paintings and descriptions; its taxonomic status is uncertain, as the material is often believed to refer to the extant spotless crake (&quot;Zapornia tabuensis&quot;).
* Saint Helena rail, &quot;Aphanocrex podarces&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, 16th century)formerly &quot;Atlantisia&quot;
* White swamphen, &quot;Porphyrio albus&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, early 19th century)
* Réunion swamphen or &quot;oiseau bleu&quot;, &quot;Porphyrio coerulescens&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, 18th century)
*:Known only from descriptions. The former existence of a &quot;Porphyrio&quot; on Réunion is fairly certain, but it has not been proven to date.
* Marquesas swamphen, &quot;Porphyrio paepae&quot; (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas)
*:May have survived to c. 1900. In the lower right hand corner of Paul Gauguin&#x27;s 1902 painting &quot;Le Sorcier d&#x27;Hiva Oa ou le Marquisien à la cape rouge&quot;, there is a bird which resembles native descriptions of &quot;P. paepae&quot;.
* North Island takahē, &quot;Porphyrio mantelli&quot; (North Island, New Zealand, late 19th century) 
*:Known from subfossil bones found in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island; may have survived to 1894 or later.
* New Caledonian gallinule, &quot;Porphyrio kukwiedei&quot; (New Caledonia, Melanesia)
*:May have survived into historic times. The native name &quot;n&#x27;dino&quot; is thought to refer to this bird.
* Samoan woodhen, &quot;Gallinula pacifica&quot; (Savaii, Samoa, 1907?)
*:Probably better placed in the genus &quot;Pareudiastes&quot;. Unconfirmed reports from the late 20th century suggest it still exists in small numbers and therefore it is officially classified as critically endangered.
* Makira woodhen, &quot;Gallinula silvestris&quot; (Makira, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Only known from a single specimen, this rail is probably better placed in its own genus, &quot;Edithornis&quot;. Unconfirmed recent records suggest it still exists and therefore it is officially classified as critically endangered.
* Tristan moorhen, &quot;Gallinula nesiotis&quot; (Tristan da Cunha, South Atlantic, late 19th century)
* Mascarene coot, &quot;Fulica newtonii&quot; (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
* Sharpe&#x27;s rail, &quot;Gallirallus sharpei&quot; (Indonesia?)
*:Only known from a type specimen, but scientist speculate that it originated form Indonesia. Could possibly be a colour morph of the buff-banded rail.
* Fernando de Noronha rail, &quot;Rallidae gen. et sp. indet&quot;. (Fernando de Noronha, West Atlantic, 16th century?)
*:A distinct species of rail inhabited Fernando de Noronha Island, but it has not been formally described yet. It probably still existed at the time of the first Western contact.
* Tahitian &quot;goose&quot;, Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Tahiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, late 18th century?)
*:Early travelers to Tahiti reported a &quot;goose&quot; that was found in the mountains. Altogether, a species of rail in the genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot; seems to be the most likely possibility.
* Bokaak &quot;bustard&quot;, Rallidae? gen. et sp. indet. &#x27;Bokaak&#x27;
*:An unidentified terrestrial bird is mentioned in an early report from Bokaak in the Marshall Islands. It was described as a &quot;bustard&quot; and may have actually been a rail or a megapode. In the former case, it may have been a vagrant of a still-existing species; in any case, no bird that could be described as &quot;bustard-like&quot; is found on Bokaak today.
* Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. &#x27;Amsterdam Island&#x27;
*:Unknown rail from Amsterdam Island; one specimen was found, but it was not recovered. Extinct by 1800, it may have been a vagrant of a still-existing species.

===Procellariiformes===
Petrels, storm petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses
* Olson&#x27;s petrel, &quot;Bulweria bifax&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Saint Helena petrel, &quot;Pseudobulweria rupinarum&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Imber&#x27;s petrel, &quot;Pterodroma imberi&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, early 19th century?)
*:Described from subfossil bones.
* Jamaican petrel, &quot;Pterodroma caribbaea&quot; (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century?)
*:Possibly a subspecies of the black-capped petrel (&quot;Pterodroma hasitata&quot;); unconfirmed reports suggest it may still exist. Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
* &quot;Pterodroma&quot; cf. &quot;leucoptera&quot; (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, South Pacific, 20th century?)
*:A wing of a petrel carcass that was similar in appearance to Gould&#x27;s petrel (&quot;Pterodroma leucoptera&quot;) was recovered on Mangareva in 1922, where it possibly bred. No such birds are known to exist there today.
* Guadalupe storm petrel, &quot;Hydrobates macrodactylus&quot; (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, 1910s)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct, but a thorough survey in 2000 concluded this species was certainly extinct.

===Sphenisciformes===
Penguins
* Extinct species of extant genera
** Eudyptescrested penguins
***Chatham penguin, &quot;Eudyptes warhami&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, between 1867 and 1872?) 
***:Only known from subfossil bones, but a bird kept in captivity sometime between 1867 and 1872 may refer to this species.

===Suliformes===
Boobies and related birds

*Sulidaegannets and boobies
**Mascarene booby, &quot;Papasula&quot; sp. (Mauritius and Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-19th century)
***An undescribed booby species that was formerly considered a population of Abbott&#x27;s booby (&quot;Papasula abbotti&quot;). Known physically only from subfossil bones, but is likely the bird referred to as a &quot;boeuf&quot; by early settlers; the &quot;boeuf&quot; was last recorded on Rodrigues in 1832 and likely went extinct following the deforestation of the island.
*Phalacrocoracidaecormorants and shags
**Spectacled cormorant, &quot;Urile perspicillatus&quot; (Commander Islands, North Pacific, c. 1850)

===Pelecaniformes===
Pelicans and related birds

*Threskiornithidaeibises and spoonbills
** Extinct species of extant genera
*** Threskiornis
****Réunion ibis, &quot;Threskiornis solitarius&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, early 18th century)
****:This species was the basis for the &quot;Réunion solitaire&quot; or &quot;white dodo&quot; (&quot;Raphus solitarius&quot;), a supposed relative of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire. Given the fact that ibis (but no dodo-like) bones were found on Réunion and that old descriptions match a flightless sacred ibis quite well, the &quot;Réunion solitaire&quot; hypothesis has been refuted.
*Ardeidaeherons, egrets, and bitterns
**Botaurinaebitterns
*** Extinct species of extant genera
**** Ixobrychus
***New Zealand bittern, &quot;Ixobrychus novaezelandiae&quot; (New Zealand, late 19th century)
***:Long considered to be vagrant individuals of the Australian little bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus dubius&quot;); bones recovered from Holocene deposits indicate that this was indeed a distinct taxon, but it may not be a distinct species.
**Ardeinaeherons and egrets
*** Extinct species of extant genera
**** Nyctanassa
***** Bermuda night heron, &quot;Nyctanassa carcinocatactes&quot; (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century)
*****:Sometimes assigned to the genus &quot;Nycticorax&quot;.
**** Nycticorax
*****Réunion night heron, &quot;Nycticorax duboisi&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
*****Mauritius night heron, &quot;Nycticorax mauritianus&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
*****Rodrigues night heron, &quot;Nycticorax megacephalus&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*****Ascension night heron, &quot;Nycticorax olsoni&quot; (Ascension Island, South Atlantic, late 16th century?)
*****:Known only from subfossil bones, but the description of a flightless Ascension Island bird by André Thévet cannot be identified with anything other than this species.

===Columbiformes===

Pigeons, doves and dodos
For the &quot;Réunion solitaire&quot;, see Réunion ibis.
* Saint Helena dove, &quot;Dysmoropelia dekarchiskos&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, 16th century?) 
*:Known only from Late Pleistocene bones, but may have persisted until the 16th century.
* Passenger pigeon, &quot;Ectopistes migratorius&quot; (eastern North America, 1914)
*:The passenger pigeon was once among the most abundant wild bird species in the world, with a single flock numbering up to 2.2 billion birds. It was hunted close to extinction for food and sport in the late 19th century. The last individual, a mateless female named Martha after Martha Washington, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.
* Bonin wood pigeon, &quot;Columba versicolor&quot; (Nakodo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1890)
* Ryukyu wood pigeon, &quot;Columba jouyi&quot; (Okinawa and Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, late 1930s)
* Rodrigues pigeon, &quot;Nesoenas rodericanus&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, before 1690?)
*:Formerly in &quot;Streptopelia&quot;. Possibly a subspecies of the Malagasy turtle dove (&quot;Nesoenas picturatus&quot;), this seems to be the bird observed by Leguat. Introduced rats may have caused it to become extinct in the late 17th century.
* Spotted green pigeon, &quot;Caloenas maculata&quot; (South Pacific or Indian Ocean islands, 1820s)
*:Also known as the Liverpool pigeon, the only known specimen has been in Liverpool&#x27;s World Museum since 1851, and was probably collected on a Pacific island for Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. It has been suggested that this bird came from Tahiti based on native lore about a somewhat similar extinct bird called the &quot;titi&quot;, but this has not yet been verified.
* Sulu bleeding-heart, &quot;Gallicolumba menagei&quot; (Tawitawi, Philippines, late 1990s?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered. Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the Sulu Archipelago in 1995; however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline and, by now, habitat destruction is almost complete. If it is not extinct, this species is certainly very rare, but the ongoing civil war prevents comprehensive surveys.
* Norfolk ground dove, &quot;Pampusana norfolciensis&quot; (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1800)
* Tanna ground dove, &quot;Pampusana ferruginea&quot; (Tanna, Vanuatu, late 18th or 19th century)
*:Only known from descriptions of two now-lost specimens.
* Thick-billed ground dove, &quot;Pampusana salamonis&quot; (Makira and Ramos, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Last recorded in 1927, only two specimens exist. Declared extinct in 2005.
* Choiseul pigeon, &quot;Microgoura meeki&quot; (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, early 20th century)
* Red-moustached fruit dove, &quot;Ptilinopus mercierii&quot; (Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, Marquesas, 1922)
*:Two subspecies, the little-known nominate subspecies &quot;P. m. mercierii&quot; of Nuku Hiva (extinct mid- to late 19th century) and &quot;P. m. tristrami&quot; of Hiva Oa (1922).
* Negros fruit dove, &quot;Ptilinopus arcanus&quot; (Negros, Philippines, late 20th century?)
*:Known only from one specimen taken at the only documented sighting in 1953; the validity of this species has been questioned, but no good alternative to distinct species status has been proposed. Officially classified as critically endangered, it may still exist on Panay, but no survey has located it. One possible record in 2002 does not seem to have been repeated since then.
* Mauritius blue pigeon, &quot;Alectroenas nitidissima&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1830s)
* Réunion blue pigeon, &quot;Alectroenas&quot; sp. (Réunion, Mascarenes, 1619)
* Providence blue pigeon, &quot;Alectroenas&quot; sp. (Farquhar Group, Seychelles, 19th century)
*:Only known from early reports; possibly a subspecies of either the Comoros blue pigeon (&quot;Alectroenas sganzini&quot;) or the Seychelles blue pigeon (&quot;Alectroenas pulcherrimus&quot;).
* Dodo, &quot;Raphus cucullatus&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
*:Called &quot;Didus ineptus&quot; by Linnaeus. A metre-high flightless bird found on Mauritius. Its forest habitat was destroyed when Dutch settlers moved to the island and the dodo&#x27;s nests and eggs were destroyed by the pigs, cats and monkeys that the Dutch brought with them. The last specimen was killed in 1681, only 80 years after the arrival of the new predators.
* Rodrigues solitaire, &quot;Pezophaps solitaria&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1730)
* Mauritian turtle dove, &quot;Nesoenas cicur&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1730s)
*:Similar to the Malagasy turtle dove but more terrestrial, with more robust legs and smaller wings. Disappeared by 1730 due to hunting, predation by introduced mammals, and deforestation.
* Mauritian wood pigeon, &quot;Columba thiriouxi&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1730s) 
*:Described from subfossil remains, it is believed to have become extinct by 1730 due to hunting, predation by introduced black rats, and deforestation. The species has been questioned due to the material being scarce and not completely distinguishable from rock doves introduced to the island in 1639. However, early historical accounts mention the existence of pigeons that were caught with ease.

===Cuculiformes===
Cuckoos
* Delalande&#x27;s coua, &quot;Coua delalandei&quot; (Madagascar, late 19th century?)
* Saint Helena cuckoo, &quot;Nannococcyx psix&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, 18th century)

===Cathartiformes===
New World vultures
* &quot;Painted vulture&quot;, &quot;Sarcoramphus sacra&quot; (Florida, North America, late 18th century?)
** A bird supposedly similar in appearance to the king vulture (&quot;Sarcoramphus papa&quot;) identified by William Bartram on his travels in the 1770s. Skeptics have stated that it is likely based on a misidentification of the crested caracara (&quot;Caracara plancus&quot;), although evidence has increasingly shifted towards it being a valid taxon that once existed, either as a distinct species in its own right or as a subspecies of the king vulture, based on an independent illustration of a nearly identical bird made several decades earlier by Eleazar Albin. See the King vulture article for discussion.

===Strigiformes===

True owls and barn owls

Strigidae - true owls
* Pernambuco pygmy owl, &quot;Glaucidium mooreorum&quot; (Pernambuco, Brazil, 2001?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, but it may still exist. A 2018 BirdLife study citing extinction patterns recommended reclassifying this species as possibly extinct.
* Réunion scops owl, &quot;Otus grucheti&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century?)
* Mauritius scops owl, &quot;Otus sauzieri&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c. 1850)
* Rodrigues scops owl, &quot;Otus murivorus&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:The preceding three species were variously placed in the genera &quot;Bubo&quot;, &quot;Athene&quot;, &quot;Scops&quot; (=&quot;Otus&quot;), &quot;Strix&quot; and &quot;Tyto&quot; and even in their own genus, &quot;Mascarenotus&quot;, before their true affinity was realized.
* Siau scops owl, &quot;Otus siaoensis&quot; (Siau Island, Indonesia, 20th century?)
*:Only known from the holotype collected in 1866. It may still exist, as there are ongoing rumors of scops owls at Siau.
* New Caledonian boobook, &quot;Ninox&quot; cf. &quot;novaeseelandiae&quot; (New Caledonia, Melanesia)
*:Known only from prehistoric bones, but it may still exist.
* Laughing owl, &quot;Ninox albifacies&quot; (New Zealand, 1914?)
*:Two subspecies: the nominate subspecies &quot;N. a. albifacies&quot; (South Island and Stewart Island, extinct 1914?) and &quot;N. a. rufifacies&quot; (North Island, extinct c. 1870s?); circumstantial evidence suggests that small remnants survived until the early or mid-20th century.

Tytonidae - barn owls
* Puerto Rican barn owl, &quot;Tyto cavatica&quot; (Puerto Rico, West Indies, early 20th century?)
*:Known from prehistoric bones found in caves on Puerto Rico; it may have still existed up to 1912, given reports of the presence of cave-roosting owls. Likely a subspecies of, or synonymous with, the still-existing ashy-faced owl (&quot;Tyto glaucops&quot;).

===Caprimulgiformes===
Caprimulgidae - nightjars and nighthawks
* Jamaican poorwill, &quot;Siphonorhis americana&quot; (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century?)
*:Reports of unidentifiable nightjars from the 1980s in habitat appropriate for this cryptic species suggest that it may still exist. Research into this possibility is currently underway; pending further information, it is officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct.
* Cuban pauraque, &quot;Siphonorhis daiquiri&quot; (Cuba, West Indies, prehistoric?)
*:Described from subfossil bones in 1985. There are persistent rumors that this bird, which was never seen alive by scientists, may still exist. Compare the Puerto Rican nightjar (&quot;Antrostomus noctitherus&quot;) and the preceding species.
* Vaurie&#x27;s nightjar, &quot;Caprimulgus centralasicus&quot; (China, early 20th century?)
*:Only known from a single specimen from Xinjiang, China taken in 1929. It has never been seen or found again, but the validity of this supposed species is seriously disputed. It was, however, never refuted to be an immature desert-dwelling female European nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;).
* New Caledonian nightjar, &quot;Eurostopodus exsul&quot; (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century)
*:This species was sighted only once in 1939; due to its cryptic habits, it may still be extant, but this is now considered to be unlikely.

===Aegotheliformes===
Aegothelidae
*New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, &quot;Aegotheles savesi&quot; (New Caledonia, late 1990s)
*not to be confused with the New Caledonian nightjar. The type specimen was collected after the bird flew into a bedroom in the village of Tonghoué. This large owlet-nightjar is only known from two specimens taken in 1880 and 1915, two other confirmed sightings and two other partly disputed sightings and one unconfirmed debated sighting. The most recent report is from a 1998 expedition which saw a large nightjar foraging for insects at dusk in Rivière Ni Valley.

===Apodiformes===
Swifts and hummingbirds
* Letitia&#x27;s thorntail, &quot;Discosura letitiae&quot; (Bolivia?)
*:Known only from three trade specimens of unknown origin. It may still exist.
* Brace&#x27;s emerald, &quot;Riccordia bracei&quot; (New Providence, Bahamas, West Indies, late 19th century)
* Gould&#x27;s emerald, &quot;Riccordia elegans&quot; (Jamaica or northern Bahamas, West Indies, late 19th century)
* Turquoise-throated puffleg, &quot;Eriocnemis godini&quot; (Ecuador, 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Known only from six pre-1900 specimens, the habitat where it occurred has been destroyed. However, the bird&#x27;s distribution remains unresolved.
* Guanacaste hummingbird, &quot;Saucerottia alfaroana&quot; (Miravalles Volcano, Costa Rica)
*:A possibly extinct species of hummingbird known only from a holotype collected in 1895 at the Miravalles Volcano in Costa Rica.

===Coraciiformes===
Kingfishers and related birds
* Saint Helena hoopoe, &quot;Upupa antaois&quot; (St. Helena, South Atlantic, early 16th century)
* Guam kingfisher, &quot;Todirhmphus cinnamominus&quot; (Guam, West Pacific, 1986)
*:This species became extinct in the wild in 1986 when 29 birds were taken for a captive breeding program, which is still ongoing. Its decline was caused by predation by introduced brown tree snakes.

===Piciformes===
Woodpeckers and related birds
* Bermuda flicker, &quot;Colaptes oceanicus&quot; (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century?)
*:Known only from fossil bones found in Bermuda and dated to the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene; however, a 17th-century report written by explorer Captain John Smith may refer to this species.
* Imperial woodpecker, &quot;Campephilus imperialis&quot; (Mexico, late 20th century)
*:This 60-centimetre-long woodpecker is officially classified as critically endangered, possibly extinct. Occasional unconfirmed reports come up; the most recent was in late 2005.
* Ivory-billed woodpecker, &quot;Campephilus principalis&quot; (southeastern United States and Cuba, late 20th century)
*:The nominate subspecies, the American ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;C. p. principalis&quot;), is officially classified as critically endangered and considered possibly extinct by some authorities.
*:The Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;C. p. bairdii&quot;) is generally considered to be extinct, but a few patches of unsurveyed potential habitat remain.

===Falconiformes===
Birds of prey
* Guadalupe caracara, &quot;Caracara lutosa&quot; (Guadalupe, East Pacific, 1900 or 1903)
* Réunion kestrel, &quot;Falco duboisi&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)

===Psittaciformes===
Parrots

* Sinú parakeet, &quot;Pyrrhura subandina&quot; (Colombia, mid-20th century?)
*:This bird has a very restricted distribution and was last reliably recorded in 1949. It was not found during searches in 2004 and 2006 and seems to be extinct; efforts to find it again continue, but are hampered by the threat of armed conflict.
* Norfolk kākā, &quot;Nestor productus&quot; (Norfolk and Philip Islands, Southwest Pacific, 1851?)
* Chatham kākā, &quot;Nestor chathamensis&quot; (Chatham Islands, New Zealand, between 1500 and 1650)
* Society parakeet, &quot;Cyanoramphus ulietanus&quot; (Raiatea, Society Islands, South Pacific, late 18th century)
* Black-fronted parakeet, &quot;Cyanoramphus zealandicus&quot; (Tahiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, c. 1850)
* Lord Howe parakeet, &quot;Cyanorhamphus subflavescens&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1870)
* Macquarie parakeet, &quot;Cyanorhamphus erythrotis&quot; (Macquarie Islands, Southwest Pacific, 1890s)
*:Last recorded in 1890 and not found by surveys in 1894.
* Paradise parrot, &quot;Psephotellus pulcherrimus&quot; (Rockhampton area, Australia, late 1920s)
* Oceanic eclectus, &quot;Eclectus infectus&quot;, known from subfossil bones found on Tonga, Vanuatu, and possibly Fiji, may have survived until the 18th century or even longer: a bird which seems to be a male &quot;Eclectus&quot; parrot was drawn in a report on the Tongan island of Vavau by the Malaspina expedition. Also, a 19th-century Tongan name &quot;āā&quot; (&quot;parrot&quot;) for &quot;a beautiful bird found only at Eua&quot; is attested (see here under &quot;kākā&quot;). This seems to refer to either &quot;E. infectus&quot;, which in Tonga is only known from Vavau and Eua, or the extirpated population of the collared lory (&quot;Vini solitaria&quot;), which also occurred there. It is possible, but unlikely, that this species survived on Eua until the 19th century.
* New Caledonian lorikeet, &quot;Vini diadema&quot; (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, there have been no reports of this species since the mid-20th century. It is, however, small and inconspicuous and is likely to have been overlooked.
* Seychelles parakeet, &quot;Psittacula wardi&quot; (Seychelles, West Indian Ocean, 1883)
* Newton&#x27;s parakeet, &quot;Psittacula exsul&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c. 1875)
* Mascarene grey parakeet, &quot;Psittacula bensoni&quot; (Mauritius, possibly Réunion as &quot;Psittacula&quot; cf. &quot;bensoni&quot;, 1760s). 
*:Formerly known as the Mauritius grey parrot (&quot;Lophopsittacus bensoni&quot;). Known from a 1602 sketch by Captain Willem van Westzanen and by subfossil bones described by David Thomas Holyoak in 1973. It may have survived into the mid-18th century.
* Mascarene parrot, &quot;Mascarinus mascarinus&quot; (Réunion and possibly Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1834?)
*:The last known individual was a captive bird which was alive before 1834.
* Broad-billed parrot, &quot;Lophopsittacus mauritianus&quot; (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1680?)
*:It may have survived into the late 18th century.
* Rodrigues parrot, &quot;Necropsittacus rodericanus&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, late 18th century)
*:The species &quot;N. francicus&quot; is fictional, &quot;N. borbonicus&quot; is most likely so.
* Glaucous macaw, &quot;Anodorhynchus glaucus&quot; (northern Argentina, early 20th century)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered due to persistent rumors of wild birds, but probably extinct.
* Cuban macaw, &quot;Ara tricolor&quot; (Cuba, late 19th century)
*:A number of related macaw species have been described from the West Indies, but are not based on good evidence. Several prehistoric forms are now known to have existed in the region, however.
* Carolina parakeet, &quot;Conuropsis carolinensis&quot; (southeastern North America, c. 1930?)
*:Although the date of the last captive bird&#x27;s death in the Cincinnati Zoo, 1918, is generally given as this species&#x27; date of extinction, there are convincing reports of some wild populations persisting until later. Two subspecies, &quot;C. c. carolinensis&quot; (Carolina parakeet, east and south of the Appalachian Mountainsextinct either 1918 or c. 1930) and &quot;C. c. ludovicianus&quot; (Louisiana parakeet, west of the Appalachian Mountainsextinct c. 1912).
* Guadeloupe parakeet, &quot;Psittacara labati&quot; (Guadeloupe, West Indies, late 18th century)
*:Only known from descriptions; the former existence of this bird is likely both for biogeographic reasons and because details about it as described cannot be referred to any known species.
* Puerto Rican parakeet, &quot;Psittacara maugei&quot; (Mona Island and possibly Puerto Rico, West Indies, 1890s)
*:Formerly considered to be a weakly differentiated subspecies of the still-existing Hispaniolan parakeet (&quot;Psittacara chloropterus&quot;).
* Martinique amazon, &quot;Amazona martinica&quot; (Martinique, West Indies, mid-18th century)
* Guadeloupe amazon, &quot;Amazona violacea&quot; (Guadeloupe, West Indies, mid-18th century)
*:These two extinct amazons were originally described from travelers&#x27; descriptions. Their existence is still controversial.

===Passeriformes===
Perching birds

Tyrannidaetyrant flycatchers
* San Cristóbal flycatcher, &quot;Pyrocephalus dubius&quot; (San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos Islands, late 20th century)
*:Described as extremely rare by David W. Steadman in the 1980s and not found despite a six-month survey in 1998.
Furnariidaeovenbirds
* Cryptic treehunter, &quot;Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti&quot; (eastern Brazil, 2007)
* Alagoas foliage-gleaner, &quot;Philydor novaesi&quot; (eastern Brazil, 2011)
AcanthisittidaeNew Zealand &quot;wrens&quot;
* Lyall&#x27;s wren, &quot;Traversia lyalli&quot; (New Zealand, 1895?)
*:A flightless species that was famously (but erroneously) claimed to have become extinct due to predation by a single lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cat named &quot;Tibbles&quot;.
* Bushwren, &quot;Xenicus longipes&quot; (New Zealand, 1972)
*:Three subspecies, &quot;X. l. stokesi&quot; (North Island, extinct 1955); the nominate subspecies &quot;X. l. longipes&quot; (South Island, extinct 1968) and &quot;X. l. variabilis&quot; (Stewart Island, extinct 1972).

MohoidaeHawaiian honeyeaters. Family established in 2008, previously in Meliphagidae.
* Kioea, &quot;Chaetoptila angustipluma&quot; (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1860s)
* Hawaii ōō, &quot;Moho nobilis&quot; (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1930s)
* Oahu ōō, &quot;Moho apicalis&quot; (Oahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
* Bishop&#x27;s ōō, &quot;Moho bishopi&quot; (Molokai and probably Maui, Hawaiian Islands, c. 1910 or 1980s)
* Kauai ōō, &quot;Moho braccatus&quot; (Kauai, Hawaiian Islands, 1987)

Meliphagidaehoneyeaters and Australian chats
* Chatham bellbird, &quot;Anthornis melanocephala&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1910)
*:Sometimes regarded as a subspecies of the New Zealand bellbird (&quot;Anthornis melanera&quot;). Unconfirmed records exist from the early to mid-1950s.
* The identity of &quot;Strigiceps leucopogon&quot; (an invalid name) described by Lesson in 1840 is unclear. Apart from the holotype supposedly from &quot;New Holland&quot;, a second specimen from the &quot;Himalaya&quot; either may have existed or may still exist. Lesson tentatively allied it to the Meliphagidae, and Rothschild felt reminded of the kioea.

Acanthizidaescrubwrens, thornbills, and gerygones
* Lord Howe gerygone, &quot;Gerygone insularis&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1930)

Pachycephalidaewhistlers, shrike-thrushes, pitohuis and allies
* Mangarevan whistler, ?&quot;Pachycephala gambierana&quot; (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, South Pacific, late 19th century?)
*:Tentatively placed here. A mysterious bird of which no specimens exist today. It was initially described as a shrike, then classified as an &quot;Eopsalteria&quot; &quot;robin&quot; and may actually be an &quot;Acrocephalus&quot; warbler.

Dicruridaemonarch flycatchers and allies
* Maupiti monarch, &quot;Pomarea pomarea&quot; (Maupiti, Society Islands, South Pacific, mid-19th century)
* Eiao monarch, &quot;Pomarea fluxa&quot; (Eiao, Marquesas, late 1970s)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the Iphis monarch (&quot;Pomarea iphis&quot;), this is an early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* Nuku Hiva monarch, &quot;Pomarea nukuhivae&quot; (Nuku Hiva, Marquesas, mid- to late 20th century)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the Marquesas monarch (&quot;Pomarea mendozae&quot;), this is another early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* Ua Pou monarch, &quot;Pomarea mira&quot; (Ua Pou, Marquesas, c. 1986)
*:Also previously considered a subspecies of the Marquesas monarch, this was a distinct species most closely related to that bird and the Fatuhiva monarch (&quot;Pomarea whitneyi&quot;).
* Guam flycatcher, &quot;Myiagra freycineti&quot; (Guam and Marianas, West Pacific, 1983)
*:Possibly a subspecies of the oceanic flycatcher (&quot;Myiagra oceanica&quot;).

OriolidaeOld World orioles and allies
* North Island piopio, &quot;Turnagra tanagra&quot; (North Island, New Zealand, c. 1970?)
*:Not reliably recorded since about 1900.
* South Island piopio, &quot;Turnagra capensis&quot; (South Island, New Zealand, 1960s?)
*:Two subspecies, &quot;T. c. minor&quot; from Stephens Island (extinct c. 1897) and the nominate subspecies &quot;T. c. capensis&quot; from the South Island mainland (last specimen taken in 1902, last unconfirmed record in 1963)

Corvidaecrows, ravens, jays and magpies
* Hawaiian crow, &quot;Corvus hawaiiensis&quot; (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 2002)
*:This species is extinct in the wild, but it is being bred in captivity.

CallaeidaeNew Zealand wattlebirds

* Huia, &quot;Heteralocha acutirostris&quot; (North Island, New Zealand, early 20th century)
* South Island kōkako, &quot;Callaeas cinereus&quot; (South Island, New Zealand, 1960s?)
*:This species is usually considered to be extinct, as it has not been reliably recorded since 1967. However, recent reports from Fiordland suggest that it may still exist.

Hirundinidaeswallows and martins
* White-eyed river martin, &quot;Pseudochelidon sirintarae&quot; (Thailand, late 1980s?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered, this enigmatic species is only known from migrating birds and it was last seen in 1986 at its former roost site. Recent unconfirmed reports suggest that it may still exist in Cambodia.
* Red Sea cliff swallow, &quot;Petrochelidon perdita&quot; (Red Sea area, late 20th century?)
*:Known from a single specimen found in 1984; this enigmatic swallow may still exist, but the lack of recent records is puzzling. It is also alternatively placed in the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot;.

Acrocephalidaeacrocephalid warblers or marsh warblers, tree warblers and reed warblers
* Nightingale reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus luscinius&quot; (Guam, West Pacific, c. 1970s)
* Pagan reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus yamashinae&quot; (Pagan, Marianas, West Pacific, 1970s)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler.

*:Also previously considered a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler.
* Mangareva reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus astrolabii&quot; (Marianas?, West Pacific, mid-19th century?)
*:Known only from two specimens found on Mangareva Island.
* Garrett&#x27;s reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus musae&quot; (Raiatea and Huahine, Society Islands, South Pacific, 19th century?)
*:Two subspecies, &quot;A. m. garretti&quot; from Huahine and &quot;A. m. musae&quot; from Raiatea. Previously considered a subspecies of the Tahiti reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus caffer&quot;).
* Moorea reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus longirostris&quot; (Moorea, Society Islands, South Pacific, 1980s?)
*:The last reliable sighting of this bird was in 1981. A survey in 1986 / 1987 was unsuccessful in finding it. A photograph of a warbler from Moorea in 1998 or 1999 taken by Philippe Bacchet remains uncertain, as do reports from 2003 and 2010. Also previously considered a subspecies of the Tahiti reed warbler.

MuscicapidaeOld World flycatchers and chats
* Rück&#x27;s blue flycatcher, &quot;Cyornis ruckii&quot; (Malaysia or Indochina, 20th century?)
*:An enigmatic species known only from two or four possibly migrant specimens, last recorded in 1918. It may still exist in northeastern Indochina. Possibly a subspecies of the Hainan blue flycatcher (&quot;Cyornis hainanus&quot;).

Megaluridaemegalurid warblers or grass warblers
* Chatham fernbird, &quot;Poodytes rufescens&quot; (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c. 1900)
*:Often placed in the genus &quot;Megalurus&quot;, but this is based on an incomplete review of the evidence.

Cisticolidaecisticolas and allies
* Tana River cisticola, &quot;Cisticola restrictus&quot; (Kenya, Africa, 1970s?)
*:A mysterious species found in the Tana River Basin in small numbers at various dates but not seen since 1972. It is probably invalid; if so, it may be based on aberrant or hybrid specimens. An unconfirmed sighting was apparently reported in 2007 at the Tana River Delta.

Zosteropidaewhite-eyes. Probably belong in Timaliidae.
* Marianne white-eye, &quot;Zosterops semiflavus&quot; (Marianne Island, Seychelles, late 19th century)
* Robust white-eye, &quot;Zosterops strenuus&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1918)
* White-chested white-eye, &quot;Zosterops albogularis&quot; (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, between 2006 and 2010)

Pycnonotidaebulbuls
* Rodrigues bulbul, &quot;Hypsipetes cowlesi&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, extinction date unknown, 17th century or 18th century might be possible)
*:Known only from subfossil bones.

Sylvioidea &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
* Aldabra brush warbler, &quot;Nesillas aldabrana&quot; (Aldabra, Indian Ocean, c. 1984)
* Rodrigues &quot;babbler&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, 17th century?)
*:Known only from subfossil bones. Provisionally assigned to Timaliidae, but its placement in this family is highly doubtful.

Sturnidaestarlings

* Kosrae starling, &quot;Aplonis corvina&quot; (Kosrae, Caroline Islands, West Pacific, mid-19th century)
* Mauke starling, &quot;Aplonis mavornata&quot; (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid-19th century)
* Tasman starling, &quot;Aplonis fusca&quot; (Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1923)
*:Two subspecies, the nominate subspecies &quot;A. f. fusca&quot;Norfolk starling (extinct c. 1923) and &quot;A. fusca hulliana&quot;Lord Howe starling (extinct c. 1919).
* Pohnpei starling, &quot;Aplonis pelzelni&quot; (Pohnpei, Micronesia, c. 2000)
*:Only one reliable record since 1956, in 1995, leaves the species&#x27; survival seriously in doubt.
* Raiatea starling, &quot;Aplonis&quot;? &quot;ulietensis&quot; (Raiatea, Society Islands, South Pacific, between 1774 and 1850)
*:Formerly called the bay thrush (&quot;Turdus ulietensis&quot;); a mysterious bird from Raiatea now only known from a painting and some descriptions of a (now lost) specimen. Its taxonomic position is thus unresolvable at present although, for biogeographic reasons and because of the surviving description, it has been suggested to have been a honeyeater. However, with the discovery of fossils of the prehistorically extinct Huahine starling (&quot;Aplonis diluvialis&quot;) on neighboring Huahine, it seems likely that this bird also belonged to this genus.
* Hoopoe starling, &quot;Fregilupus varius&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, 1850s)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae.
* Rodrigues starling, &quot;Necropsar rodericanus&quot; (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century?)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae. The bird that was variously described as &quot;Necropsar leguati&quot; or &quot;Orphanopsar leguati&quot; and was considered to be identical with &quot;N. rodericanus&quot; (which itself is known only from subfossil bones) was found to be based on a misidentified albino specimen of the grey trembler (&quot;Cinclocerthia gutturalis&quot;).

Turdidaethrushes and allies
* Grand Cayman thrush, &quot;Turdus ravidus&quot; (Grand Cayman, West Indies, late 1940s)
* Bonin thrush, &quot;Zoothera terrestris&quot; (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1830s)
* Kāmao, &quot;Myadestes myadestinus&quot; (Kauai, Hawaiian Islands, 1990s)
* Olomao, &quot;Myadestes lanaiensis&quot; (Hawaiian Islands, 1980s?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered because a possible location on Molokai remains unsurveyed. Three subspecies are known from Oahu (&quot;M. l. woahensis&quot;, extinct 1850s), Lanai (the nominate subspecies &quot;M. l. lanaiensis&quot;, extinct early 1930s) and Molokai (&quot;M. l. rutha&quot;, extinct 1980s?) and there may be a possible fourth subspecies from Maui (extinct before the late 19th century).

Mimidaemockingbirds and thrashers
* Cozumel thrasher, &quot;Toxostoma guttatum&quot; (Cozumel, West Indies, early in the first decade of the 21st century?)
*:It is still unknown whether the tiny population rediscovered in 2004 survived Hurricanes Emily and Wilma in 2005. There have also been unconfirmed records in April 2006 and October and December 2007.

Estrildidaeestrildid finches (waxbills, munias, etc.)
* Black-lored waxbill, &quot;Estrilda nigriloris&quot; (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:An enigmatic species not seen since 1950; because part of its habitat is in Upemba National Park, it may still exist.

IcteridaeNew World blackbirds and allies
* Slender-billed grackle, &quot;Quiscalus palustris&quot; (Mexico, 1910)

ParulidaeNew World warblers
* Bachman&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Vermivora bachmanii&quot; (southern United States, c. 1990?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered.
* Semper&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Leucopeza semperi&quot; (St. Lucia, West Indies, 1970s?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered. Suitable habitat remains and there have been unconfirmed records within the last 10 years.

Ploceidaeweavers
* Réunion fody, &quot;Foudia delloni&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1672)
*:Formerly &quot;Foudia bruante&quot;; the latter scientific name may actually be a color morph of the red fody (&quot;Foudia madagascariensis&quot;).

Cardinalidaecardinals
*Townsend&#x27;s dickcissel, &quot;Spiza townsendi&quot;
*Either a hybrid, an extinct species or a variant of the dickcissel.

Fringillidaetrue finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers
* Bonin grosbeak, &quot;Carpodacus ferreorostris&quot; (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, 1830s)
* Ōū, &quot;Psittirostra psittacea&quot; (Hawaiian Islands, c. 2000?)

Emberizidaebuntings and New World sparrows
* Hooded seedeater, &quot;Sporophila melanops&quot; (Brazil, 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as critically endangered. It is known only from a single male collected in 1823 and has variously been considered either an aberrant specimen of the yellow-bellied seedeater (&quot;Sporophila nigricollis&quot;) or a hybrid.
* Bermuda towhee, &quot;Pipilo naufragus&quot; (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century?) 
*:Known from subfossil bones and possibly from a travel report by William Strachey in 1610.

==Possibly extinct bird subspecies or status unknown==
The extinction of subspecies is a subject that is very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as red lists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations, such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of bird taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any one of, or any combination of, these three factors: absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.

===Struthioniformes===
Ratites and related birds

*Struthioostriches
** Arabian ostrich, &quot;Struthio camelus syriacus&quot; (Arabia, 1966)
*:The last record of this subspecies of the common ostrich was a bird found dead in Jordan in 1966.

*Dromaiusemu
**King Island emu, &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae minor&quot; (King Island, Australia, 1822)
**:An island dwarf subspecies of the emu; extinct in the wild c. 1805, the last captive specimen died in 1822 in the Jardin des Plantes.
**Kangaroo Island emu, &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus&quot; (Kangaroo Island, Australia, 1827)
**:Another island dwarf subspecies of the emu; extinct since c. 1827.
**Tasmanian emu, &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis&quot; (Tasmania, Australia, mid-19th century)
**:Yet another island dwarf subspecies of the emu; the last wild bird was collected in 1845, but it may have survived in captivity until 1884. It may be invalid.

===Anseriformes===
Ducks, geese and swans
* Bering cackling goose, &quot;Branta hutchinsii asiatica&quot; (Commander and Kuril Islands, N Pacific, c. 1914 or 1929)
*:A formerly recognised subspecies of the cackling goose (formerly called the Bering Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis asiatica&quot;)) which was not distinct from the similar-looking and still-existing Aleutian cackling goose (&quot;B. h. leucopareia&quot;) and is now considered to be invalid.
* Rennell Island teal, &quot;Anas gibberifrons remissa&quot; (Rennell Island, Solomon Islands, c. 1959)
*:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the Sunda teal which disappeared due to predation on ducklings by introduced Mozambique tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis mossambicus&quot;).
* Niceforo&#x27;s yellow-billed pintail, &quot;Anas georgica niceforoi&quot; (Colombia, 1950s)
*:A subspecies of the yellow-billed pintail that has not been recorded since the 1950s.
* Borrero&#x27;s cinnamon teal, &quot;Anas cyanoptera borreroi&quot; (Colombia, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the cinnamon teal known only from a restricted area in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, with a couple of records from Ecuador. It was discovered in 1946 and thought to have become extinct by 1956.
* Coues&#x27;s gadwall, &quot;Mareca strepera couesi&quot; (Teraina, Kiribati, c. 1900)
*:This island subspecies of the gadwall was discovered and named in 1874 after two birds were shot and has not been recorded since, with none found by a 1924 expedition from Honolulu&#x27;s Bishop Museum.

===Galliformes===

Quails and relatives
* Lake Amik black francolin, &quot;Francolinus francolinus billypayni&quot; (southern Turkey, possibly Lebanon, 1960s)
*:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the black francolin.
* Sicilian black francolin, &quot;Francolinus francolinus&quot; ssp. (Sicily, Mediterranean, c. 1869)
*:Another doubtfully distinct subspecies of the black francolin.

*:A subspecies of the helmeted guineafowl. Reportedly still kept in captivity in Morocco in the late 1990s. Possibly extinct in the wild by 1950; three records from the 1970s may refer to feral-domestic hybrids.

===Charadriiformes===
Shorebirds, gulls and auks

Scolopacidaesandpipers
* Kiritimati sandpiper, &quot;Prosobonia cancellata cancellata&quot; (Kiritimati, Kirabati, 19th century?)

Turnicidaebuttonquails
* Tawitawi common buttonquail, &quot;Turnix sylvaticus suluensis&quot; (Tawitawi, Sulu Archipelago, Philippines, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the common buttonquail; it has not been recorded since the 1950s, but there have been few surveys and it may still exist.

===Gruiformes===
Rails and alliesprobably paraphyletic
* Goldman&#x27;s yellow rail, &quot;Coturnicops noveboracensis goldmani&quot; (Mexico, late 20th century?) 
*:A subspecies of the yellow rail that has not been recorded since 1964 and has lost much of its wetland habitat since then.
* Macquarie rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia philippensis macquariensis&quot; (Macquarie Islands, Southwest Pacific, 1880s)
*:A subspecies of the buff-banded rail.
* Raoul Island banded rail, &quot;Hypotaenidia philippensis&quot; ssp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, Southwest Pacific, late 19th century?)
*:Reports of the former occurrence of the species on Raoul seem to be plausible enough, but they may refer to vagrant individuals of another subspecies of the buff-banded rail.
* Peruvian rail, &quot;Rallus semiplumbeus peruvianus&quot; (Peru, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Bogota rail which is known from a single specimen collected in the 1880s. It may still exist.
* Western Lewin&#x27;s rail, &quot;Lewinia pectoralis clelandi&quot; (southwestern Australia, late 1930s?)
*:A subspecies of Lewin&#x27;s rail not recorded since 1932 despite multiple surveys in the late 20th century.
* Assumption white-throated rail, &quot;Dryolimnas cuvieri abbotti&quot; (Assumption, Astove and Cosmoledo, Aldabra, early 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the white-throated rail.
* Jamaican wood rail, &quot;Amaurolimnas concolor concolor&quot; (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century)
*:The nominate subspecies of the uniform crake declined rapidly and became extinct following the introduction of the small Indian mongoose (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;) to Jamaica in 1872.
* Intact rail, &quot;Gymnocrex plumbeiventris intactus&quot; (Melanesia, 20th century?)
*:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the bare-eyed rail known from a single specimen, c. mid-19th century, either from the Solomon Islands or New Ireland. It may still exist.
* Bornean Baillon&#x27;s crake, &quot;Zapornia pusilla mira&quot; (Borneo, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of Baillon&#x27;s crake known from a single 1912 specimen and not found since; it may be extinct, but the species is hard to find.
* Moroccan bustard, &quot;Ardeotis arabs lynesi&quot; (Morocco, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Arabian bustard. Last observed in 1993 at Lac Merzouga / Lac Tamezguidat.
* Luzon sarus crane, &quot;Antigone antigone luzonica&quot; (Luzon, Philippines, late 1960s)
*:A subspecies of the sarus crane which is not always accepted as valid by all authorities, possibly because the existing specimens have not been thoroughly studied since it was first described.

===Pelecaniformes===

Herons and related birdspossibly paraphyletic
*Ardeidaeherons, egrets, and bitterns
** Bonin nankeen night heron, &quot;Nycticorax caledonicus crassirostris&quot; (Nakoudo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c. 1890)
**:A subspecies of the nankeen night heron.

===Columbiformes===
Pigeons, doves and dodos
* Madeiran wood pigeon, &quot;Columba palumbus maderensis&quot; (Madeira, East Atlantic, early 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the common wood pigeon.
* Lord Howe pigeon, &quot;Columba vitiensis godmanae&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, 1853)
*:This subspecies of the metallic pigeon was last recorded in 1853 and almost certainly became extinct by 1869.
* Tongan metallic pigeon, &quot;Columba vitiensis&quot; ssp. (Vavau, Tonga, late 18th century?)
*:This subspecies of the metallic pigeon is only known from a footnote in John Latham&#x27;s &quot;General History of Birds&quot; and seems to have become extinct some time before 1800; possibly, however, the location is erroneous and the footnote really refers to the still-existing population on Fiji.
* Réunion pink pigeon, &quot;Nesoenas mayeri duboisi&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, c. 1700)
*:A subspecies of the pink pigeon, formerly in &quot;Streptopelia&quot;. There seems to have been at least another species of pigeon on Réunion (probably a blue pigeon species), but bones have not yet been found. It became extinct at the same time as this subspecies did. 
*Amirante turtle dove, &quot;Nesoenas picturatus aldabrana&quot; (Amirante Islands, Seychelles, late 20th century)
*:This subspecies of the Malagasy turtle dove survived until at least 1974, after which it was hybridised out of existence through crossbreeding with the introduced nominate subspecies (&quot;N. p. picturatus&quot;).
* Catanduanes bleeding-heart, &quot;Gallicolumba luzonica rubiventris&quot; (Catanduanes, Philippines, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Luzon bleeding-heart known from a single specimen collected in 1971. There have been recent reports of this bird and, as much of its forest habitat still remains, it is likely that it may still exist.
* Basilan bleeding-heart, &quot;Gallicolumba crinigera bartletti&quot; (Basilan, Philippines, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Mindanao bleeding-heart last reported in 1925 and, given the massive habitat destruction, is likely extinct.
* Vella Lavella ground dove, &quot;Pampusana jobiensis chalconota&quot; (Vella Lavella, Makira and Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the white-breasted ground dove or possibly a distinct species. Known from only four specimens; there are no recent records and the natives report that it has disappeared.
* White-headed Polynesian ground dove, &quot;Pampusana erythroptera albicollis&quot; (Central Tuamotu Islands, 20th century?)
*:This subspecies of the Polynesian ground dove, often referred to as &quot;P. e. pectoralis&quot;, became extinct at an undetermined date, but it may still exist on some unsurveyed atolls. The identity of the northern Tuamotu population, which may also possibly still exist, is undetermined to date.
* Ebon crimson-crowned fruit dove, &quot;Ptilinopus porphyraceus marshallianus&quot; (Ebon?, Marshall Islands, late 19th century?)
*:A subspecies of the crimson-crowned fruit dove of doubtful validity known from a single specimen collected in 1859; it is not certain whether or not this bird actually did occur on Ebon. All that can be said is that this subspecies is no longer found anywhere.
* Mauke lilac-crowned fruit dove, &quot;Ptilinopus rarotongensis &quot;byronensis&quot;&quot; (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid- or late 19th century)
*:A subspecies of the lilac-crowned fruit dove known only from the description of a now-lost specimen. The prehistorically extinct population on Mangaia likely belongs to another distinct subspecies also.
* Negros spotted imperial pigeon, &quot;Ducula carola nigrorum&quot; (Negros and probably Siquijor, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the spotted imperial pigeon not recorded since the 1950s.
* Norfolk pigeon, &quot;Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae spadicea&quot; (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, early 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the kererū or New Zealand pigeon not recorded since 1900. Similar birds were reported from Lord Howe Island; these seem to represent another extinct subspecies, but are undescribed to date.
* Raoul Island kererū, &quot;Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae&quot; ssp. nov. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 19th century)
*:Another undescribed subspecies of the kererū or New Zealand pigeon or possibly a distinct species; known from bones and a brief report.

===Cuculiformes===
Cuckoos
* Greater crested coua, &quot;Coua cristata maxima&quot; (southeastern Madagascar, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the crested coua, known only from a single specimen taken in 1950. It may be a hybrid but if it is not, it is probably extinct.
* Assumption Island coucal, &quot;Centropus toulou assumptionis&quot; (Assumption Island, Seychelles, early 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Malagasy coucal last recorded in 1906. It is sometimes considered synonymous with the Aldabra subspecies (&quot;C. t. insularis&quot;) which has since recolonized Assumption Island.
* Cabo San Lucas groove-billed ani, &quot;Crotophaga sulcirostris pallidula&quot; (Mexico, c. 1940)
*:A weakly differentiated and probably invalid subspecies of the groove-billed ani.

*:A subspecies of the rufous-vented ground cuckoo.

===Strigiformes===
True owls and barn owls

Strigidaetrue owls
* Sulu reddish scops owl, &quot;Otus rufescens burbidgei&quot; (Sulu, Philippines, mid-20th century)
*:A subspecies of the reddish scops owl only known from a single questionable specimen. It may be invalid.
* Virgin Islands owl, &quot;Gymnasio nudipes newtoni&quot; (Virgin Islands, West Indies, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Puerto Rican owl of somewhat doubtful validity, which occurred on several of the Virgin Islands. The last reliable records were in 1860; there were a number of unconfirmed reports during the 20th century, but it was not found in thorough surveys in 1995.
* Socorro elf owl, &quot;Micrathene whitneyi graysoni&quot; (Socorro, Revillagigedo Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the elf owl officially classified as critically endangered. The last specimen was taken in 1932, but there was apparently still a large population in 1958; it was not found in subsequent searches and it appears to have become extinct.
* Antiguan burrowing owl, &quot;Athene cunicularia amaura&quot; (Antigua, St. Kitts and Nevis, West Indies, c. 1900)
*:A subspecies of the burrowing owl, last collected in 1890 and extinct by 1903.
* Guadeloupe burrowing owl, &quot;Athene cunicularia guadeloupensis&quot; (Guadeloupe and Marie-Galante, West Indies, c. 1890)
*:Another subspecies of the burrowing owl, extinct by 1890.
* Lord Howe boobook, &quot;Ninox novaeseelandiae albaria&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, 1950s)
*:A subspecies of the Australian boobook last recorded in the 1950s.
* Norfolk boobook, &quot;Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata&quot; (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1990s)
*:Individuals of the nominate subspecies of the Australian boobook were introduced in a last-ditch effort to save the local owl population. There now exists a hybrid population of a few dozen birds; the last certainly distinct individual of &quot;N. n. undulata&quot;, a female named Miamiti, died in 1996, though individuals descended from her remain.

Tytonidaebarn owls
* Cave-nesting masked owl, &quot;Tyto novaehollandiae troughtoni&quot; (Nullarbor Plain, Australia, 1960s)
*:Doubtfully distinct from the nominate subspecies of the Australian masked owl, but differed behaviorally.
* Buru masked owl, &quot;Tyto sororcula cayelii&quot; (Buru, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Moluccan masked owl last recorded in 1921; the identity of a similar bird found on Seram remains to be determined. It may still exist, as an owl matching this bird&#x27;s description was encountered in August 2006.
* Peleng masked owl, &quot;Tyto rosenbergii pelengensis&quot; (Peleng, Banggai Islands, mid-20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Sulawesi masked owl or a distinct species. It may possibly still exist, but the only known specimen was taken in 1938 and there have been no further records since then.
* Samar bay owl, &quot;Phodilus badius riverae&quot; (Samar, Philippines, mid-20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Oriental bay owl or a possibly distinct species. Its taxonomy is doubtful, but the only known specimen was lost in a 1945 bombing raid, so its validity cannot be verified; no population exists on Samar today.

===Apodiformes===
Swifts and hummingbirds
* Miravalles indigo-capped hummingbird, &quot;Saucerottia cyanifrons alfaroana&quot; (Costa Rica, Central America, 20th century?)
*:This subspecies of the indigo-capped hummingbird is only known from a specimen collected in Costa Rica in 1895. It is likely to have become extinct since then.
* Alejandro Selkirk firecrown, &quot;Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi&quot; (Alejandro Selkirk Island, Juan Fernández Islands, Southeast Pacific, 1908)
*:A subspecies of the Juan Fernández firecrown last recorded in 1908.
* Luzon Whitehead&#x27;s swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus whiteheadi whiteheadi&quot; (Luzon, Philippines, 20th century?)
*:The nominate subspecies of Whitehead&#x27;s swiftlet is only known from four specimens collected at Mount Data in 1895. Because of the lack of further records and massive habitat destruction, it is usually considered extinct. Given the size of the island, though, it may still exist.

===Coraciiformes===
Kingfishers and related birds
* Sangihe dwarf kingfisher, &quot;Ceyx fallax sangirensis&quot; (Sangihe, Indonesia, 1998?)
*:This subspecies of the Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher was last seen in 1997 but not during a thorough survey one year later; it is either close to extinction or already extinct. Sometimes it is said to occur on the Talaud Islands also, but this is erroneous.
* Guadalcanal little kingfisher, &quot;Ceyx pusillus aolae&quot; (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, ?)
*:A subspecies of the little kingfisher.
* Rarotonga kingfisher, &quot;Todiramphus&quot; cf. &quot;tutus&quot; (Rarotonga, Cook Islands, mid-1980s?)
*:There exist reports of locals that kingfishersprobably a subspecies of the chattering kingfisher (&quot;Todiramphus tutus&quot;) which is found on neighboring islands, but possibly vagrants from therewere found until around 1979 and there is a last record from 1984. Presently, no kingfishers are known to exist on Rarotonga.
* &quot;Ryukyu kingfisher&quot;, &quot;Todiramphus cinnamominus miyakoensis&quot; (Miyako-jima, Ryukyu Islands, late 19th century)
*:Previously considered as a distinct species, then reclassified as a subspecies of the Guam kingfisher. Only seen once by scientists in 1887; the specimen taken is somewhat damaged, making identification by anything other than molecular analysis difficult. It is now thought likely that the specimen came from Guam, where the aforementioned species was distributed, rather than Miyako, which would make this subspecies invalid (it was declared invalid by the International Ornithological Congress in 2022).
* Sakarha pygmy kingfisher, &quot;Corythornis madagascariensis dilutus&quot; (southwestern Madagascar, late 20th century?)
*:This subspecies of the Madagascar pygmy kingfisher is only known from one specimen taken in 1974 in an area where most of its habitat had already been destroyed. However, there have been records of the species (or an uncertain subspecies) from near the type locality, suggesting it is likely that it may still exist.
* Ticao hornbill, &quot;Penelopides panini ticaensis&quot; (Ticao, Philippines, 1970s)
*:A subspecies of the Visayan hornbill of somewhat uncertain taxonomic status (it was possibly either a distinct species or a color morph); the last confirmed report was in 1971 and it became extinct shortly thereafter.

===Piciformes===
Woodpeckers and related birds
* Grand Bahama West Indian woodpecker, &quot;Melanerpes superciliaris bahamensis&quot; (Grand Bahama, Bahamas, 1950s)
*:A subspecies of the West Indian woodpecker of somewhat uncertain validity.
* Javan buff-rumped woodpecker, &quot;Meiglyptes tristis tristis&quot; (Java, Indonesia, c. 1920?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the buff-rumped woodpecker became rare during the 19th century due to habitat destruction. The last confirmed record was in 1880, and it is now considered to be at least very rare.
* Guadalupe red-shafted flicker, &quot;Colaptes auratus rufipileus&quot; (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, c. 1906)
*:A subspecies of the northern flicker (formerly considered to be a subspecies of the red-shafted flicker, as &quot;C. cafer rufipileus&quot;), it was last recorded in 1906 and not found again in both 1911 and 1922. It may be invalid. Recently, vagrant birds of a mainland red-shafted northern flicker subspecies (which one is unknown) have begun recolonizing the island as the habitat improved after the extirpation of feral goats.
* Northern white-mantled barbet, &quot;Capito hypoleucus hypoleucus&quot; (Colombia, extant)
*:The nominate subspecies of the white-mantled barbet has been considered extinct, but has been recorded recently.
* Botero white-mantled barbet, &quot;Capito hypoleucus carrikeri&quot; (Colombia, extant)
*:Another subspecies of the white-mantled barbet, also considered extinct by some sources, but confirmed extant by researchers in Colombia.
* Todd&#x27;s jacamar, &quot;Brachygalba lugubris phaeonota&quot; (Brazil, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the brown jacamar, or possibly a hybrid, a color morph or a distinct species. It may still exist, as it is only known from a remote and seldom-visited area.
* Cebu white-bellied woodpecker, &quot;Dryocopus javensis cebuensis&quot; (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the white-bellied woodpecker only known by three specimens collected before 1900.

===Accipitriformes===
Birds of prey
* Cape Verde kite, &quot;Milvus&quot; (&quot;milvus&quot;) &quot;fasciicauda&quot; (Cape Verde Islands, East Atlantic, 2000)
*:Considered either a subspecies of the red kite, a distinct species, or a hybrid between the red and black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), the validity of this taxon has recently been questioned on the basis of molecular analysis; however, hybridization and a confusing molecular phylogeny of red kite populations, coupled with the distinct phenotype of the Cape Verde birds, suggest that the taxonomic status of this form is far from resolved.
* Car Nicobar sparrowhawk, &quot;Accipiter butleri butleri&quot; (Car Nicobar, Nicobar Islands, 20th century?)
*: The nominate subspecies of the Nicobar sparrowhawka species which is itself currently classified as vulnerableis possibly extinct. It was last reliably recorded in 1901 and, despite searches, has not been sighted after an unconfirmed record in 1977; however, the species is known for being very shy and a population may persist unrecorded.

===Falconiformes===
Falcons
* Volcano Islands peregrine falcon, &quot;Falco peregrinus furuitii&quot; (Ogasawara Islands, 1940s)
*:A subspecies of the peregrine falcon from the Ogasawara Islands. No sightings have been reported since 1945. A survey in 1982 failed to record it. Only known from Iwo Jima and Torishima.

===Psittaciformes===
Parrots
* Sangir red-and-blue lory, &quot;Eos histrio histrio&quot; (Sangir Archipelago, Indonesia, 1990s?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the red-and-blue lory was hybridised out of existence through crossbreeding with escaped captive individuals of its other still-existing subspecies, Challenger&#x27;s red-and-blue lory (&quot;E. h. challengeri&quot;), with the last certainly distinct individuals disappearing in the 1990s or even much earlier than that.
* Réunion parakeet, &quot;Psittacula eques eques&quot; (Réunion, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:Known only from a painting and descriptions; the nominate subspecies of the echo parakeet, with the other one being the still-existing Mauritius parakeet (&quot;P. e. echo&quot;).
* Siquijor hanging parrot, &quot;Loriculus philippensis siquijorensis&quot; (Siquijor, Philippines, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Philippine hanging parrot or colasisi; it is either very rare or already extinct.
* Sinú brown-throated parakeet, &quot;Eupsittula pertinax griseipecta&quot; (Colombia, mid- or late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the brown-throated parakeet known from only two specimens collected in 1949 which are of unclear taxonomic and conservation status.
* Culebra Island amazon, &quot;Amazona vittata gracilipes&quot; (Culebra Island, West Indies, early 20th century)
*:A weakly differentiated subspecies of the Puerto Rican amazon, which is itself highly endangered.

===Passeriformes===
Perching birds

Pittidaepittas
* Bougainville black-faced pitta, &quot;Pitta anerythra pallida&quot; (Bougainville, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the black-faced pitta. Once common on Bougainville; not recorded since 1938, but it is likely to have been overlooked.
* Choiseul black-faced pitta, &quot;Pitta anerythra nigrifrons&quot; (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, late 20th century?)
*:Another subspecies of the black-faced pitta. Not found during recent searches; doubtful records from nearby islands, but it is also likely to have been overlooked.

Tyrannidaetyrant flycatchers
* Bogotá bearded tachuri, &quot;Polystictus pectoralis bogotensis&quot; (central Colombia, 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the bearded tachuri or possibly a distinct species that has not been recorded for some time and is now extinct.
* Grenadan Euler&#x27;s flycatcher, &quot;Lathrotriccus euleri flaviventris&quot; (Grenada, West Indies, 1950s?)
*:A subspecies of Euler&#x27;s flycatcher formerly known as &quot;Empidonax euleri johnstoni&quot;. It has not been recorded since the 1950s.

Furnariidaeovenbirds
* Peruvian scale-throated earthcreeper, &quot;Upucerthia dumetaria peruana&quot; (Peru, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the scale-throated earthcreeper; it is known only from two specimens taken in the early 1950s at Puno, Peru and has not been seen or found since. It may still exist, as there is no obvious reason why it should have become extinct.
* Northern stripe-crowned spinetail, &quot;Cranioleuca pyrrhophia rufipennis&quot; (northern Bolivia, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the stripe-crowned spinetail known only from a few specimens and not recorded since the 1950s; it may be endangered or possibly extinct.

Formicariidaeantpittas and antthrushes
* Northern giant antpitta, &quot;Grallaria gigantea lehmanni&quot; (Colombia, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the giant antpitta (or possibly of the great antpitta, in which case it would be &quot;G. excelsa lehmanni&quot;) apparently not recorded since the 1940s. It may still exist in Puracé National Natural Park, where there is plentiful habitat remaining.
* Antioquia brown-banded antpitta, &quot;Grallaria milleri gilesi&quot; (Antioquia, Colombia, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the brown-banded antpitta recently described from a specimen collected in 1878. It has not been recorded since, despite surveys at a number of likely locations.

MaluridaeAustralasian &quot;wrens&quot;
* MacDonnell Ranges thick-billed grasswren, &quot;Amytornis modestus modestus&quot; (Northern Territory, Australia, 1936)
*:The nominate subspecies of the thick-billed grasswren. The last record was a clutch of eggs taken in 1936.
* Namoi thick-billed grasswren, &quot;Amytornis modestus inexpectatus&quot; (New South Wales, Australia, 1886)
*:Another subspecies of the thick-billed grasswren last recorded in 1886.
* Large-tailed grasswren, &quot;Amytornis textilis macrourus&quot; (Western Australia, 1910)
*:A subspecies of the western grasswren last collected in 1910 and extinct since then.

Pardalotidaepardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills and gerygones

* Western rufous bristlebird, &quot;Dasyornis broadbenti littoralis&quot; (Australia, mid-20th century)
*:A subspecies of the rufous bristlebird not recorded since 1940 despite a number of surveys since then, beginning in the 1970s.
* King Island brown thornbill, &quot;Acanthiza pusilla archibaldi&quot; (King Island, Australia, likely extant)
*:A subspecies of the brown thornbill which has only been recorded about 10 times since its discovery and is considered extinct by some authorities. The latest record comes from 2002, suggesting a population is likely to still exist, but it is very rare.

PetroicidaeAustralasian &quot;robins&quot;
* Tiwi Island hooded robin, &quot;Melanodryas cucullata melvillensis&quot; (Tiwi Islands, Australia, 1992)
*:A subspecies of the hooded robin last observed in 1992 and not found in exhaustive searches later in the 1990s.

Artamidaewoodswallows, currawongs and allies
* Western pied currawong, &quot;Strepera graculina ashbyi&quot; (Victoria, Australia, 1927)
*:This subspecies of the pied currawong has been hybridised out of existence by crossbreeding with other subspecies, which probably came into contact with it following habitat destruction in the 1830s. The last certainly distinct individuals were recorded in 1927.

Monarchidaemonarch flycatchers
* Negros celestial monarch, &quot;Hypothymis coelestis rabori&quot; (Negros and possibly Sibuyan, Philippines, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the celestial monarch; not uncommon on Negros in 1959, but not recorded since then. A single Sibuyan specimen from an unspecified locality taken in the 19th century is the only record for this island.
* Hiva Oa monarch, &quot;Pomarea mendozae mendozae&quot; (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas, late 20th century)
*:The nominate subspecies of the Marquesas monarch which was very rare by 1974 and not found during multiple surveys in the 1990s.

Rhipiduridaefantails
* Lord Howe fantail, &quot;Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c. 1924)
*:A subspecies of the New Zealand fantail that was considered virtually extinct in 1924 and not found by surveys four years later.
* Guam rufous fantail, &quot;Rhipidura versicolor uraniae&quot; (Guam and Marianas, West Pacific, 1984)
*:A subspecies of the Micronesian rufous fantail; a conspicuous bird which has not been recorded since 1984.

* Maros cicadabird, &quot;Edolisoma tenuirostre edithae&quot; (Sulawesi, mid-20th century)
*:A subspecies of the common cicadabird known from a single specimen collected in 1931; quite possibly just a vagrant individual.
* Cebu blackish cuckooshrike, &quot;Edolisoma coerulescens altera&quot; (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the blackish cuckooshrike; it may still exist, as this bird is rather unmistakable, and a 1999 record is therefore likely to be valid, though surveys since then have failed to record it.
* Marinduque blackish cuckooshrike, &quot;Edolisoma coerulescens deschauenseei&quot; (Marinduque, Philippines, late 20th century?)
*:Another subspecies of the blackish cuckooshrike; described from specimens collected in 1971, but apparently not seen since then. As few ornithologists have visited Marinduque and forest remains on the island, it is likely that it may still exist.
* Norfolk long-tailed triller, &quot;Lalage leucopyga leucopyga&quot; (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1942)
*:The nominate subspecies of the long-tailed triller or possibly a distinct species.

OriolidaeOld World orioles and allies
* Cebu dark-throated oriole, &quot;Oriolus xanthonotus assimilis&quot; (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the dark-throated oriole not confirmed since 1906, though there were unconfirmed reports c. 2001, suggesting a possibility that it may still exist.

Corvidaecrows, ravens, jays and magpies

* Pied raven, &quot;Corvus corax varius&quot; morpha &quot;leucophaeus&quot; (Faroe Islands, North Atlantic, 1902)
*:A distinct local white-with-black-markings and light brown-billed color morph of the North Atlantic raven, a subspecies of the common raven, found only on the Faroe Islands and not seen since 1902. Birds currently living on the Faroe Islands and on Iceland (the only other area in this subspecies&#x27; range) are all-black and black-billed; this still-existing color morph is named &quot;Corvus corax varius&quot; morpha &quot;typicus&quot;.

Regulidaekinglets
* Guadalupe ruby-crowned kinglet, &quot;Corthylio calendula obscurus&quot; (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the ruby-crowned kinglet that has not been recorded since 1953.

Hirundinidaeswallows and martins
* Jamaican golden swallow, &quot;Tachycineta euchrysea euchrysea&quot; (Jamaica, West Indies, c. 1990?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the golden swallow; endemic to Jamaica. The last major roost site was destroyed in 1987 and the last confirmed sighting was in 1989. It may still exist in the Cockpit Country.

* Eastern Canary Islands chiffchaff, &quot;Phylloscopus canariensis exsul&quot; (Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the Canary Islands chiffchaff; it was probably extinct by 1986.

Cettiidaecettiid warblers or typical bush warblers
* Babar stubtail, &quot;Urosphena subulata advena&quot; (Babar, Indonesia, extant)
*:A subspecies of the Timor stubtail that has been considered extinct, but was recorded as common on Babar in 2009 and 2011.
* Western Turner&#x27;s eremomela, &quot;Eremomela turneri kalindei&quot; (Congo Basin, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:The West African subspecies of Turner&#x27;s eremomela has not been recorded since the end of the 1970s, but there is unsurveyed habitat in its range where it is likely that it may still exist. Its placement in Cettiidae requires confirmation.

Acrocephalidaeacrocephalid warblers or marsh warblers, tree warblers and reed warblers
* Marshall Islands reed warbler, &quot;Acrocephalus rehsei&quot; ssp.? (Marshall Islands, Micronesia, c. 1880?)
*:Oral tradition and some early reports mention a bird called the &quot;annañ&quot; which inhabited some of the Marshall Islands. The best match is the Nauru reed warbler; the &quot;annañ&quot; might have been an undescribed subspecies of that species or a distinct but related species of reed warbler.
* Laysan millerbird, &quot;Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris&quot; (Laysan, Hawaiian Islands, late 1910s)
*:The nominate subspecies of the millerbird.

Pycnonotidaebulbuls

*:A subspecies of the blue-wattled bulbul known only from a single specimen taken in 1937; however, this entire &quot;species&quot; may actually be a hybrid.

Cisticolidaecisticolas and allies
* Northern white-winged apalis, &quot;Apalis chariessa chariessa&quot; (Kenya, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the white-winged apalis remains known only from the Tana River, a centre of endemism. It was last recorded in 1961.

Sylviidaesylviid (&quot;true&quot;) warblers and parrotbills
* Vanua Levu long-legged thicketbird, &quot;Cincloramphus rufus clunei&quot; (Vanua Levu, Fiji, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the long-legged thicketbird; it was found only once, but there was an unconfirmed sighting in 1990, suggesting that it may still exist. Its placement in Sylviidae is doubtful.
* Fayyum warbler, &quot;Curruca melanocephala&quot; / &quot;momus norissae&quot; (Egypt, Africa, 1939)
*:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the Sardinian warbler. It has not been recorded since 1939.

Zosteropidaewhite-eyes. Probably belong in Timaliidae.
* Guam bridled white-eye, &quot;Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus&quot; (Guam and Marianas, West Pacific, 1983)
*:The nominate subspecies of the bridled white-eye or possibly a monotypic species. It was last recorded in 1983.
* Mukojima white-eye, &quot;Apalopteron familiare familiare&quot; (Mukojima Group, Ogasawara Islands, 20th century?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the Bonin white-eye (formerly known as the &quot;Bonin honeyeater&quot;) not recorded since its last specimen was collected in 1930.

TimaliidaeOld World babblers
* Vanderbilt&#x27;s babbler, &quot;Malacocincla sepiaria vanderbilti&quot; (Sumatra, Indonesia, late 20th century?)

* Burmese Jerdon&#x27;s babbler, &quot;Chrysomma altirostre altirostre&quot; (Myanmar, 20th century?)
*:The nominate subspecies of Jerdon&#x27;s babbler was last confirmed in 1941, but as there has been little fieldwork in its range and a possible sighting occurred in 1994, it is considered likely that it may still exist.

&quot;African warblers&quot;
* Chapin&#x27;s white-browed crombec, &quot;Sylvietta leucophrys chapini&quot; (Congo Basin, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the white-browed crombec or possibly a distinct species. Restricted to the Lendu Plateau; it is probably rare, though unsurveyed forest remains where it is likely that it may still exist.

Sylvioidea &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
* Lake Amik bearded reedling, &quot;Panurus biarmicus kosswigi&quot; (southern Turkey, extant)
*:A subspecies of the bearded reedling which was once considered to be extinct due to the drainage of Lake Amik, but still exists in the area.

Troglodytidaewrens
* San Benedicto rock wren, &quot;Salpinctes obsoletus exsul&quot; (San Benedicto, Revillagigedo Islands, 1952)
*:A subspecies of the rock wren which became extinct c. 9:00 AM, August 1, 1952, when its island habitat was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption.
* Guadalupe Bewick&#x27;s wren, &quot;Thryomanes bewickii brevicauda&quot; (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, late 1890s?)
*:A subspecies of Bewick&#x27;s wren. An extinction date of &quot;1903&quot; seems to be in error; the last unquestionable record dates from 1897 and a thorough search in 1901 failed to record it.
* San Clemente Bewick&#x27;s wren, &quot;Thryomanes bewickii leucophrys&quot; (San Clemente Island, East Pacific, 1941)
*:Another subspecies of Bewick&#x27;s wren last recorded in 1941.
* Daito wren, &quot;Troglodytes troglodytes orii&quot; (Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, c. 1940)
*:A disputed subspecies of the Eurasian wren; it is known from a single specimen that may have been a vagrant individual and, therefore, it is possibly invalid.
* Guadeloupe house wren, &quot;Troglodytes aedon guadeloupensis&quot; (Guadeloupe, West Indies, late 20th century?)
*:Found in 1914, 1969 and the 1970s; now very rare or already extinct. Its taxonomy is unresolved. A part of the house wren complex; other scientific names for it include &quot;T. musculus guadeloupensis&quot; and &quot;T. guadeloupensis&quot;.
* Martinique house wren, &quot;Troglodytes aedon martinicensis&quot; (Martinique, West Indies, c. 1890)
*:Last found in 1886. Its taxonomy is also unresolved. Another part of the house wren complex; other scientific names for it include &quot;T. musculus martinicensis&quot; and &quot;T. martinicensis&quot;.

*:The nominate subspecies of the Tasman Sea island thrush last seen in 1975.
* Lord Howe thrush, &quot;Turdus poliocephalus vinitinctus&quot; (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, early 20th century)
*:The second subspecies of the Tasman Sea island thrush last recorded in 1913 and extinct by 1928.
* Maré thrush, &quot;Turdus vanikorensis mareensis&quot; (Maré Island, New Caledonia, early 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Vanikoro island thrush last collected in 1911 or 1912 and not found again after 1939.
* Saint Lucia forest thrush, &quot;Turdus lherminieri sanctaeluciae&quot; (St. Lucia, West Indies, extant)
*:A subspecies of the forest thrush. It has been thought to be extinct, but it was recorded at Des Chassin in 2007.
* Peleng red-and-black thrush, &quot;Geohichia mendeni mendeni&quot; (Peleng, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the red-and-black thrush; little is known about it.
* Kibale black-eared ground thrush, &quot;Geohichia camaronensis kibalensis&quot; (southwestern Uganda, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the black-eared ground thrush or possibly a distinct species; known only from two specimens, both from 1966. It is likely that it still exists in suitable habitat, but it could already be extinct.
* Choiseul russet-tailed thrush, &quot;Zoothera heinei choiseuli&quot; (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:A subspecies of the russet-tailed thrush known from a single specimen found in 1924. It could have been wiped out by introduced feral cats, but the island is poorly known and so it should not be presumed extinct yet.
*Isle of Pines solitaire, &quot;Myadestes elisabeth retrusus&quot; (Isla de la Juventud, West Indies, 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Cuban solitaire. The last confirmed records were in the 1930s, with unconfirmed reports in the early 1970s.

Mimidaemockingbirds and thrashers
* Barbados scaly-breasted thrasher, &quot;Allenia fusca atlantica&quot; (Barbados, West Indies, 1987?)
*:A subspecies of the scaly-breasted thrasher last recorded in 1987. Most of its range has been searched since then, with no records known.

Estrildidaeestrildid finches (waxbills, munias, etc.)
* Southern star finch, &quot;Bathilda ruficauda ruficauda&quot; (Australia, 1995)
*:The nominate subspecies of the star finch last recorded in 1995 and not found during later searches in the 1990s. It is not known to survive in captivity.

Fringillidaetrue finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers
* San Benito house finch, &quot;Haemorhous mexicanus mcgregori&quot; (San Benito, East Pacific, c. 1940s)
*:A subspecies of the house finch.
* Lanai alauahio, &quot;Paroreomyza montana montana&quot; (Lanai, Hawaiian Islands, 1937)
*:The nominate subspecies of the Maui alauahio (or, more properly, the Maui Nui alauahio), it was last recorded in 1937 and was certainly extinct by 1960.

IcteridaeNew World blackbirds and allies
* Grand Cayman oriole, &quot;Icterus leucopteryx bairdi&quot; (Grand Cayman, West Indies, late 20th century)
*:A subspecies of the Jamaican oriole last recorded in 1967.

ParulidaeNew World warblers
* New Providence yellowthroat, &quot;Geothlypis rostrata rostrata&quot; (Andros and New Providence, Bahamas, West Indies, 1990?)
*:The nominate subspecies of the Bahama yellowthroat; it is either extinct or almost extinct.

Thraupidaetanagers
* Gonâve western chat-tanager, &quot;Calyptophilus tertius abbotti&quot; (Gonâve, West Indies, c. 1980?)
*:A subspecies of the western chat-tanager last recorded in 1977 and probably extinct.
* Samaná eastern chat-tanager, &quot;Calyptophilus frugivorus frugivorus&quot; (eastern Hispaniola, West Indies, late 20th century)
*:The nominate subspecies of the eastern chat-tanager; the last (unconfirmed?) record was in 1982 and concerted efforts to record it ever since have failed.
* Darwin&#x27;s large ground finch, &quot;Geospiza magnirostris magnirostris&quot; (Floreana Island?, Galápagos Islands, 1957?)
*:The (possibly invalid) nominate subspecies of the large ground finch collected by Charles Darwin in 1835; he gave no precise location for it. A similar bird was found in 1957, but no others have been seen since then.
* Saint Kitts bullfinch, &quot;Melopyrrha portoricensis grandis&quot; (St. Kitts and (prehistorically) Barbuda, West Indies, 1930)
*:A subspecies of the Puerto Rican bullfinch.
Emberizoideabuntings and New World sparrows
* Todos Santos rufous-crowned sparrow, &quot;Aimophila ruficeps sanctorum&quot; (Islas Todos Santos, East Pacific, 1970s?)
*:A subspecies of the rufous-crowned sparrow once common but not recorded during surveys in the 1970s or since then.
* Santa Barbara song sparrow, &quot;Melospiza melodia graminea&quot; (Santa Barbara Island, North America, late 1960s) 
*:A subspecies of the song sparrow last seen in 1967; it became extinct due to a severe wildfire in 1959 and subsequent predation by feral cats. Officially declared extinct by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1983.
* Dusky seaside sparrow, &quot;Ammospiza maritima nigrescens&quot; (Florida, North America, late 1980s)
*:A subspecies of the seaside sparrow last recorded in the wild in 1987.

<doc id="9732" wikidata="Q280930" url="?curid=9732" title="Eli Whitney">
<text>Eli Whitney Jr. (December 8, 1765January 8, 1825) was an American inventor, widely known for inventing the cotton gin in 1793, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution that shaped the economy of the Antebellum South.

Whitney&#x27;s invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States and prolonged the institution. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost much of his profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention to securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. He continued making arms and inventing until his death in 1825.

==Early life and education==

Whitney was born in Westborough, Massachusetts, on December 8, 1765, the eldest child of Eli Whitney Sr., a prosperous farmer, and his wife Elizabeth Fay, also of Westborough.

The younger Eli was famous during his lifetime and after his death by the name &quot;Eli Whitney&quot;, though he was technically Eli Whitney Jr. His son, born in 1820, also named Eli, was known during his lifetime and afterward by the name &quot;Eli Whitney Jr.&quot;

Whitney&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Fay, died in 1777, when he was 11. At age 14 he operated a profitable nail manufacturing operation in his father&#x27;s workshop during the Revolutionary War.

Because his stepmother opposed his wish to attend college, Whitney worked as a farm laborer and school teacher to save money. He prepared for Yale at Leicester Academy (later Becker College) and under the tutelage of Rev. Elizur Goodrich of Durham, Connecticut, he entered Yale in the fall of 1789 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1792. Whitney expected to study law but, finding himself short of funds, accepted an offer to go to South Carolina as a private tutor.
Instead of reaching his destination, he was convinced to visit Georgia. In the closing years of the 18th century, Georgia was a magnet for New Englanders seeking their fortunes (its Revolutionary-era governor had been Lyman Hall, a migrant from Connecticut). When he initially sailed for South Carolina, among his shipmates were the widow (Catherine Littlefield Greene) and family of the Revolutionary hero Gen. Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island. Mrs. Greene invited Whitney to visit her Georgia plantation, Mulberry Grove. Her plantation manager and husband-to-be was Phineas Miller, another Connecticut migrant and Yale graduate (class of 1785), who would become Whitney&#x27;s business partner.

==Career==
Whitney is most famous for two innovations which came to have significant impacts on the United States in the mid-19th century: the cotton gin (1793) and his advocacy of interchangeable parts. In the South, the cotton gin revolutionized the way cotton was harvested and reinvigorated slavery. Conversely, in the North the adoption of interchangeable parts revolutionized the manufacturing industry, contributing greatly to the U.S. victory in the Civil War.

===Cotton gin===

The cotton gin is a mechanical device that removes the seeds from cotton, a process that had previously been extremely labor-intensive. The word &quot;gin&quot; is short for &quot;engine.&quot; While staying at Mulberry Grove, Whitney constructed several ingenious household devices which led Mrs Greene to introduce him to some businessmen who were discussing the desirability of a machine to
separate the short staple upland cotton from its seeds, work that was then done by hand at the rate of a pound of lint a day. In a few weeks Whitney produced a model. The cotton gin was a wooden drum stuck with hooks that pulled the cotton fibers through a mesh. The cotton seeds would not fit through the mesh and fell outside. Whitney occasionally told a story wherein he was pondering an improved method of seeding the cotton when he was inspired by observing a cat attempting to pull a chicken through a fence, and able to only pull through some of the feathers.

A single cotton gin could generate up to of cleaned cotton daily. This contributed to the economic development of the Southern United States, a prime cotton growing area; some historians believe that this invention allowed for the African slavery system in the Southern United States to become more sustainable at a critical point in its development.

Whitney applied for the patent for his cotton gin on October 28, 1793, and received the patent (later numbered as X72) on March 14, 1794, but it was not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of gristmills and sawmills, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton – two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of patent law, made infringement inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits (one patent, later annulled, was granted in 1796 to Hogden Holmes for a gin which substituted circular saws for the spikes) and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797. One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney&#x27;s first design. There are claims that the use of wires rather than pegs was proposed by Mrs. Greene, but these are disputed.

After validation of the patent, the legislature of South Carolina voted $50,000 for the rights for that state, while North Carolina levied a license tax for five years, from which about $30,000 was realized. There is a claim that Tennessee paid about $10,000.

While the cotton gin did not earn Whitney the fortune he had hoped for, it did give him fame. It has been argued by some historians that Whitney&#x27;s cotton gin was an important if unintended cause of the American Civil War. After Whitney&#x27;s invention, the plantation slavery industry was rejuvenated, eventually culminating in the Civil War.

The cotton gin transformed Southern agriculture and the national economy. Southern cotton found ready markets in Europe and in the burgeoning textile mills of New England. Cotton exports from the U.S. boomed after the cotton gin&#x27;s appearance – from less than in 1793 to by 1810. Cotton was a staple that could be stored for long periods and shipped long distances, unlike most agricultural products. It became the U.S.&#x27;s chief export, representing over half the value of U.S. exports from 1820 to 1860.

Whitney believed that his cotton gin would reduce the demand for enslaved labor and would help hasten the end of southern slavery. Paradoxically, the cotton gin, a labor-saving device, helped preserve and prolong slavery in the United States for another 70 years. Before the 1790s, slave labor was primarily employed in growing rice, tobacco, and indigo, none of which were especially profitable anymore. Neither was cotton, due to the difficulty of seed removal. But with the invention of the gin, growing cotton with slave labor became highly profitable – the chief source of wealth in the American South, and the basis of frontier settlement from Georgia to Texas. &quot;King Cotton&quot; became a dominant economic force, and slavery was sustained as a key institution of Southern society.

===Interchangeable parts===

Eli Whitney has often been incorrectly credited with inventing the idea of interchangeable parts, which he championed for years as a maker of muskets; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney&#x27;s role in it was one of promotion and popularizing, not invention. Successful implementation of the idea eluded Whitney until near the end of his life, occurring first in others&#x27; armories.

Attempts at interchangeability of parts can be traced back as far as the Punic Wars through both archaeological remains of boats now in Museo Archeologico Baglio Anselmi and contemporary written accounts. In modern times the idea developed over decades among many people. An early leader was Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval, an 18th-century French artillerist who created a fair amount of standardization of artillery pieces, although not true interchangeability of parts. He inspired others, including Honoré Blanc and Louis de Tousard, to work further on the idea, and on shoulder weapons as well as artillery. In the 19th century these efforts produced the &quot;armory system,&quot; or American system of manufacturing. Certain other New Englanders, including Captain John H. Hall and Simeon North, arrived at successful interchangeability before Whitney&#x27;s armory did. The Whitney armory finally succeeded not long after his death in 1825.

The motives behind Whitney&#x27;s acceptance of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney was on the verge of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in debt. His New Haven cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The French Revolution had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The War Department issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott Jr., sent him a &quot;foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques,&quot; possibly one of Honoré Blanc&#x27;s reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.
In May 1798, Congress voted for legislation that would use 800,000 dollars in order to pay for small arms and cannons in case war with France erupted. It offered a 5,000 dollar incentive with an additional 5,000 dollars once that money was exhausted for the person that was able to accurately produce arms for the government. Because the cotton gin had not brought Whitney the rewards he believed it promised, he accepted the offer. Although the contract was for one year, Whitney did not deliver the arms until 1809, using multiple excuses for the delay. Recently, historians have found that during 1801–1806, Whitney took the money and headed into South Carolina in order to profit from the cotton gin.

Although Whitney&#x27;s demonstration of 1801 appeared to show the feasibility of creating interchangeable parts, Merritt Roe Smith concludes that it was &quot;staged&quot; and &quot;duped government authorities&quot; into believing that he had been successful. The charade gained him time and resources toward achieving that goal.

When the government complained that Whitney&#x27;s price per musket compared unfavorably with those produced in government armories, he was able to calculate an actual price per musket by including fixed costs such as insurance and machinery, which the government had not accounted for. He thus made early contributions to both the concepts of cost accounting, and economic efficiency in manufacturing.

===Milling machine===

Machine tool historian Joseph W. Roe credited Whitney with inventing the first milling machine circa 1818. Subsequent work by other historians (Woodbury; Smith; Muir; Battison [cited by Baida]) suggests that Whitney was among a group of contemporaries all developing milling machines at about the same time (1814 to 1818), and that the others were more important to the innovation than Whitney was. (The machine that excited Roe may not have been built until 1825, after Whitney&#x27;s death.) Therefore, no one person can properly be described as the inventor of the milling machine.

==Later life and legacy==

Despite his humble origins, Whitney was keenly aware of the value of social and political connections. In building his arms business, he took full advantage of the access that his status as a Yale alumnus gave him to other well-placed graduates, such as Oliver Wolcott Jr., Secretary of the Treasury (class of 1778), and James Hillhouse, a New Haven developer and political leader.

His 1817 marriage to Henrietta Edwards, granddaughter of the famed evangelist Jonathan Edwards, daughter of Pierpont Edwards, head of the Democratic Party in Connecticut, and first cousin of Yale&#x27;s president, Timothy Dwight, the state&#x27;s leading Federalist, further tied him to Connecticut&#x27;s ruling elite. In a business dependent on government contracts, such connections were essential to success.

Whitney died of prostate cancer on January 8, 1825, in New Haven, Connecticut, just a month after his 59th birthday. He left a widow and his four children behind. One of his offspring, Eli Whitney III (known as Eli Whitney Jr.), was instrumental in building New Haven, Connecticut&#x27;s waterworks. During the course of his illness, he reportedly invented and constructed several devices to mechanically ease his pain.

The Eli Whitney Students Program, Yale University&#x27;s admissions program for non-traditional students, is named in honor of Whitney, who not only began his studies there when he was 23, but also went on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in just three years.

<text>The American Prisoner is a British novel written by Eden Phillpotts and published in 1904 and adapted into a film by the same name in 1929. The story concerns an English woman who lives at Fox Tor farm, and an American captured during the American War of Independence and held at the prison at Princetown on Dartmoor.

In the novel &quot;Malherb&quot; is a miscreant who destroys Childe&#x27;s tomb and beats his servant. He is depicted as a victim of his own bad temper rather than a sadist.

Malherb is introduced as the younger son of a noble family and he builds the Fox Tor house to be the impressive gentleman&#x27;s residence suggested by William Crossing rather than the humble cottage which it actually is.

<doc id="9735" wikidata="Q177625" url="?curid=9735" title="Electromagnetic field">
<text>An electromagnetic field (also EM field) is a physical field, mathematical functions of position and time, representing the influences on and due to electric charges. The field at any point in space and time can be regarded as a combination of an electric field and a magnetic field. 
Because of the interrelationship between the fields, a disturbance in the electric field can create a disturbance in the magnetic field which in turn affects the electric field, leading to an oscillation that propagates through space, known as an &quot;electromagnetic wave&quot;.

The way in which charges and currents (i.e. streams of charges) interact with the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations and the Lorentz force law. Maxwell&#x27;s equations detail how the electric field converges towards or diverges away from electric charges, how the magnetic field curls around electrical currents, and how changes in the electric and magnetic fields influence each other. The Lorentz force law states that a charge subject to an electric field feels a force along the direction of the field, and a charge moving through a magnetic field feels a force that is perpendicular both to the magnetic field and to its direction of motion. 

The electromagnetic field is described by classical electrodynamics, an example of a classical field theory. This theory describes many macroscopic physical phenomena accurately. However, it was unable to explain the photoelectric effect and atomic absorption spectroscopy, experiments at the atomic scale. That required the use of quantum mechanics, specifically the quantization of the electromagnetic field and the development of quantum electrodynamics.

== History ==
The empirical investigation of electromagnetism is at least as old as the ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician and scientist Thales of Miletus, who around 600 BCE described his experiments rubbing fur of animals on various materials such as amber creating static electricity. By the 18th century, it was understood that objects can carry positive or negative electric charge, that two objects carrying charge of the same sign repel each other, that two objects carrying charges of opposite sign attract one another, and that the strength of this force falls off as the square of the distance between them. Michael Faraday visualized this in terms of the charges interacting via the electric field. An electric field is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a magnetic field as well as an electric field are produced when the charge moves, creating an electric current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater whole—the electromagnetic field. In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted showed that an electric current can deflect a nearby compass needle, establishing that electricity and magnetism are closely related phenomena. Faraday then made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields could induce electric currents in 1831. 

In 1861, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized all the work to date on electrical and magnetic phenomena into a single mathematical theory, from which he then deduced that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell&#x27;s continuous field theory was very successful until evidence supporting the atomic model of matter emerged. Beginning in 1877, Hendrik Lorentz developed an atomic model of electromagnetism and in 1897 J. J. Thomson completed experiments that defined the electron. The Lorentz theory works for free charges in electromagnetic fields, but fails to predict the energy spectrum for bound charges in atoms and molecules. For that problem, quantum mechanics is needed, ultimately leading to the theory of quantum electrodynamics.

Practical applications of the new understanding of electromagnetic fields emerged in the late 1800s. The electrical generator and motor were invented using only the empirical findings like Faraday&#x27;s and Ampere&#x27;s laws combined with practical experience.

== Mathematical description ==

There are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-dimensional vector fields. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as (electric field) and (magnetic field).

If only the electric field () is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an electrostatic field. Similarly, if only the magnetic field () is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a magnetostatic field. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

With the advent of special relativity, physical laws became amenable to the formalism of tensors. Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be written in tensor form, generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical laws.

The behavior of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or electrodynamics (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell&#x27;s equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:

; Gauss&#x27;s law : formula_1
; Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism : formula_2
; Faraday&#x27;s law : formula_3
; Ampère–Maxwell law : formula_4
where formula_5 is the charge density, which is a function of time and position, formula_6 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_7 is the vacuum permeability, and is the current density vector, also a function of time and position. Inside a linear material, Maxwell&#x27;s equations change by switching the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often represented by complex numbers, or tensors.

The Lorentz force law governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged matter.

When a field travels across to different media, the behavior of the field changes according to the properties of the media.

== Properties of the field ==
=== Electrostatics and magnetostatics ===
The Maxwell equations simplify when the charge density at each point in space does not change over time and all electric currents likewise remain constant. All of the time derivatives vanish from the equations, leaving two expressions that involve the electric field,
formula_8
and
formula_9
along with two formulae that involve the magnetic field:

These expressions are the basic equations of electrostatics, which focuses on situations where electrical charges do not move, and magnetostatics, the corresponding area of magnetic phenomena.

=== Transformations of electromagnetic fields ===
Whether a physical effect is attributable to an electric field or to a magnetic field is dependent upon the observer, in a way that special relativity makes mathematically precise. For example, suppose that a laboratory contains a long straight wire that carries an electrical current. In the frame of reference where the laboratory is at rest, the wire is motionless and electrically neutral: the current, composed of negatively charged electrons, moves against a background of positively charged ions, and the densities of positive and negative charges cancel each other out. A test charge near the wire would feel no electrical force from the wire. However, if the test charge is in motion parallel to the current, the situation changes. In the rest frame of the test charge, the positive and negative charges in the wire are moving at different speeds, and so the positive and negative charge distributions are Lorentz-contracted by different amounts. Consequently, the wire has a nonzero net charge density, and the test charge must experience a nonzero electric field and thus a nonzero force. In the rest frame of the laboratory, there is no electric field to explain the test charge being pulled towards or pushed away from the wire. So, an observer in the laboratory rest frame concludes that a field must be present.

In general, a situation that one observer describes using only an electric field will be described by an observer in a different inertial frame using a combination of electric and magnetic fields. Analogously, a phenomenon that one observer describes using only a magnetic field will be, in a relatively moving reference frame, described by a combination of fields. The rules for relating the fields required in different reference frames are the Lorentz transformations of the fields.

Thus, electrostatics and magnetostatics are now seen as studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and magnetic will appear in any other frame, these &quot;simpler&quot; effects are merely a consequence of different frames of measurement. The fact that the two field variations can be reproduced just by changing the motion of the observer is further evidence that there is only a single actual field involved which is simply being observed differently.

=== Reciprocal behavior of electric and magnetic fields ===

The two Maxwell equations, Faraday&#x27;s Law and the Ampère–Maxwell Law, illustrate a very practical feature of the electromagnetic field. Faraday&#x27;s Law may be stated roughly as &quot;a changing magnetic field inside a loop creates an electric voltage around the loop&quot;. This is the principle behind the electric generator.

Ampere&#x27;s Law roughly states that &quot;an electrical current around a loop creates a magnetic field through the loop&quot;. Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an electric motor.

=== Behavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents ===

Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be combined to derive wave equations. The solutions of these equations take the form of an electromagnetic wave. In a volume of space not containing charges or currents (free space) – that is, where formula_5 and are zero, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy these electromagnetic wave equations:
: formula_13
: formula_14

James Clerk Maxwell was the first to obtain this relationship by his completion of Maxwell&#x27;s equations with the addition of a displacement current term to Ampere&#x27;s circuital law. This unified the physical understanding of electricity, magnetism, and light: visible light is but one portion of the full range of electromagnetic waves, the electromagnetic spectrum.

=== Time-varying EM fields in Maxwell&#x27;s equations ===

An electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called electromagnetic radiation (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents in the source. Such radiation can occur across a wide range of frequencies called the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the named and linked articles.

A notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.

A changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and charges (see near and far field for a definition of &quot;close&quot;) will have a dipole characteristic that is dominated by either a changing electric dipole, or a changing magnetic dipole. This type of dipole field near sources is called an electromagnetic &quot;near-field&quot;.

Changing dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields mainly as a source of dielectric heating. Otherwise, they appear parasitically around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose of generating EMR at greater distances.

Changing dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used commercially for many types of magnetic induction devices. These include motors and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as RFID tags, metal detectors, and MRI scanner coils at higher frequencies.

== Health and safety ==

The potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely depending on the frequency, intensity of the fields, and the length of the exposure. Low frequency, low intensity, and short duration exposure to electromagnetic radiation is generally considered safe. On the other hand, radiation from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet light and gamma rays, are known to cause significant harm in some circumstances.

<doc id="9736" wikidata="Q9188" url="?curid=9736" title="Empire State Building">
<text>The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from &quot;Empire State&quot;, the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of and stands a total of tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building was the world&#x27;s tallest building until the first tower of the World Trade Center was topped out in 1970; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was once more New York City&#x27;s tallest building until it was surpassed in 2012 by One World Trade Center. , the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 57th-tallest completed skyscraper in the world.

The site of the Empire State Building, on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world&#x27;s tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building&#x27;s construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.

The building&#x27;s Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building&#x27;s 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film &quot;King Kong&quot; was released in 1933. The building&#x27;s size has been used as a standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects&#x27; List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

==Site==
The Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue, between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north, in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue. Visitors to the observatories use an entrance at 20 West 34th Street; prior to August 2018, visitors entered through the Fifth Avenue lobby. Although physically located in South Midtown, a mixed residential and commercial area, the building is so large that it was assigned its own ZIP Code, 10118; , it is one of 43 buildings in New York City that have their own ZIP codes.

The areas surrounding the Empire State Building are home to other major points of interest, including Macy&#x27;s at Herald Square on Sixth Avenue and 34th Street, and Koreatown on 32nd Street between Madison and Sixth avenues. To the east of the Empire State Building is Murray Hill, a neighborhood with a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment activity. The block directly to the northeast contains the B. Altman and Company Building, which houses the City University of New York&#x27;s Graduate Center. The nearest New York City Subway stations are 34th Street–Herald Square, one block west, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue, two blocks east; there is also a PATH station at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue.

==Architecture==
The Empire State Building was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the Art Deco style. The Empire State Building is tall to its 102nd floor, or including its pinnacle. It was the first building in the world to be more than 100 stories tall, though only the lowest 86 stories are usable. The first through 85th floors contain of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory. The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes. Atop the 102nd story is the pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.

===Form===
The Empire State Building has a symmetrical massing because of its large lot and relatively short base. Its articulation consists of three horizontal sections—a base, shaft, and capital—similar to the components of a column. The five-story base occupies the entire lot, while the 81-story shaft above it is set back sharply from the base. The setback above the 5th story is deep on all sides. There are smaller setbacks on the upper stories, allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors while also positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below. The setbacks are located at the 21st, 25th, 30th, 72nd, 81st, and 85th stories. The setbacks correspond to the tops of elevator shafts, allowing interior spaces to be at most deep .

The setbacks were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well. Normally, a building of the Empire State&#x27;s dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd Street and 34th Street sides, before it would have to utilize setbacks. However, with the largest setback being located above the base, the tower stories could contain a uniform shape. According to architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern, the building&#x27;s form contrasted with the nearly contemporary, similarly designed 500 Fifth Avenue eight blocks north, which had an asymmetrical massing on a smaller lot.

===Facade===
The Empire State Building&#x27;s Art Deco design is typical of pre–World War II architecture in New York City. The facade is clad in Indiana limestone panels made by the Indiana Limestone Company and sourced from a quarry in south-central Indiana; the panels give the building its signature blonde color. According to official fact sheets, the facade uses of limestone and granite, ten million bricks, and of aluminum and stainless steel. The building also contains 6,514 windows. The decorative features on the facade are largely geometric, in contrast with earlier buildings, whose decorations often were intended to represent a specific narrative.

The main entrance, composed of three sets of metal doors, is at the center of the facade&#x27;s Fifth Avenue elevation, flanked by molded piers that are topped with eagles. Above the main entrance is a transom, a triple-height transom window with geometric patterns, and the golden letters &quot;Empire State&quot; above the fifth-floor windows. There are two entrances each on 33rd and 34th streets, with modernistic, stainless steel canopies projecting from the entrances on 33rd and 34th streets there. Above the secondary entrances are triple windows, less elaborate in design than those on Fifth Avenue.

The storefronts on the first floor contain aluminum-framed doors and windows within a black granite cladding. The second through fourth stories consist of windows alternating with wide stone piers and narrower stone mullions. The fifth story contains windows alternating with wide and narrow mullions, and is topped by a horizontal stone sill.

The facade of the tower stories is split into several vertical bays on each side, with windows projecting slightly from the limestone cladding. The bays are arranged into sets of one, two, or three windows on each floor. The bays are separated by alternating narrow and wide piers, the inclusion of which may have been influenced by the design of the contemporary Daily News Building. The windows in each bay are separated by vertical nickel-chrome steel mullions and connected by horizontal aluminum spandrels between each floor. The windows are placed within stainless-steel frames, which saved money by eliminating the need to apply a stone finish around the windows. In addition, the use of aluminum spandrels obviated the need for cross-bonding, which would have been required if stone had been used instead.

===Lights===
The building was originally equipped with white searchlights at the top. They were first used in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt&#x27;s victory over Hoover in the presidential election of that year. These were later swapped for four &quot;Freedom Lights&quot; in 1956. In February 1964, flood lights were added on the 72nd floor to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year. The lights were shut off from November 1973 to July 1974 because of the energy crisis at the time. In 1976, the businessman Douglas Leigh suggested that Wien and Helmsley install 204 metal-halide lights, which were four times as bright as the 1,000 incandescent lights they were to replace. New red, white, and blue metal-halide lights were installed in time for the country&#x27;s bicentennial that July. After the bicentennial, Helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost, about $116 a year.

Since October 12, 1977, the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays. Organizations are allowed to make requests through the building&#x27;s website. The building is also lit in the colors of New York-based sports teams on nights when they host games: for example, orange, blue, and white for the New York Knicks; red, white, and blue for the New York Rangers. The spire can also be lit to commemorate events including disasters, anniversaries, or deaths, as well as for celebrations such as Pride and Halloween. In 1998, the building was lit in blue after the death of singer Frank Sinatra, who was nicknamed &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes&quot;.

The structure was lit in red, white, and blue for several months after the September 11 attacks in 2001. On January 13, 2012, the building was lit in red, orange, and yellow to honor the 60th anniversary of the NBC program &quot;The Today Show&quot;. After retired basketball player Kobe Bryant&#x27;s January 2020 death, the building was lit in purple and gold, signifying the colors of his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers. The evening after iconic actor James Earl Jones died, September 9, 2024, the building was lit up to look like Jones&#x27;s iconic Darth Vader villain from &quot;Star Wars.&quot;

In addition to lightings, the Empire State Building is able to do immersive visual projections on the building&#x27;s exterior. It partnered with Netflix in May 2022 to celebrate the return of Stranger Things fourth season by projecting the Upside Down onto the Empire State Building.

In 2012, the building&#x27;s four hundred metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard during the 2012 United States presidential election, using red and blue lights to represent Republican and Democratic electoral votes respectively. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. Artists such as Eminem and OneRepublic have been featured in later shows, including the building&#x27;s annual Holiday Music-to-Lights Show. The building&#x27;s owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they do not use the lights to play advertisements.

===Interior===
According to official fact sheets, the Empire State Building weighs and has an internal volume of . The interior required of elevator cable and of electrical wires. It has a total floor area of , and each of the floors in the base cover . This gives the building capacity for 20,000 tenants and 15,000 visitors.

The riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building&#x27;s gravitational stresses and wind loads. The amount of material used in the building&#x27;s construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of versus the Willis Tower&#x27;s and the John Hancock Center&#x27;s . A December 1930 feature in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; estimated that a building with the Empire State&#x27;s dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of .

Utilities are grouped in a central shaft. On the 6th through 86th stories, the central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides. Per the final specifications of the building, the corridor is surrounded in turn by office space deep, maximizing office space at a time before air conditioning became commonplace. Each of the floors has 210 structural columns that pass through it, which provide structural stability but limits the amount of open space on these floors. The relative dearth of stone in the Empire State Building allows for more space overall, with a 1:200 stone-to-building ratio compared to a 1:50 ratio in similar buildings.

====Lobby====

The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building&#x27;s east side, and is the only place in the building where the design contains narrative motifs. It contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three &quot;crafts or industries&quot; used in the building&#x27;s construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating. The three-story-high space runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets. The lobby contains two tiers of marble: a wainscoting of darker marble, topped by lighter marble. There is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from east to west. To the north and south are storefronts, which are flanked by tubes of dark rounded marble and topped by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble. Until the 1960s, there was a Longchamps restaurant next to the lobby, with six oval murals designed by Winold Reiss; these murals were placed in storage when the Longchamps closed.

The western ends of the north and south walls include escalators to a mezzanine level. At the west end of the lobby, behind the security desk, is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (without the antenna). The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect, contains an embossed outline of the building, with rays radiating from the spire and the sun behind it. In the background is a state map of New York with the building&#x27;s location marked by a &quot;medallion&quot; in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is depicted in the bottom right and a plaque to the building&#x27;s major developers is on the bottom left. A scale model of the building was also placed south of the security desk.
The plaque at the western end of the lobby is on the eastern interior wall of a one-story-tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby. The rectangular-shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle, as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side. At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors. The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators (originally stairs), which go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from the northern and southern corridors, respectively. The side entrances from 33rd and 34th Street lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel-and-glass-enclosed bridges at the mezzanine floor.

Until the 1960s, an Art Deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the Machine Age, was installed in the lobby ceilings. Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur. The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov, in time for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, depicting the building as the Eighth Wonder of the World alongside the traditional seven. The building&#x27;s owners installed a series of paintings by the New York artist Kysa Johnson in the concourse level. Johnson later filed a federal lawsuit, in January 2014, under the Visual Artists Rights Act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist. As part of the building&#x27;s 2010 renovation, Denise Amses commissioned a work consisting of 15,000 stars and 5,000 circles, superimposed on a etched-glass installation, in the lobby.

==== Elevators ====
The Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all, including service elevators. Its original 64 elevators, built by the Otis Elevator Company, in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor. As originally built, there were four &quot;express&quot; elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 &quot;local&quot; elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use (comprising the four express elevators and 54 local elevators), and eight were for freight deliveries. The elevators were designed to move at . At the time of the skyscraper&#x27;s construction, their practical speed was limited to per city law, but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened.

Additional elevators connect the 80th floor to the six floors above it, as the six extra floors were built after the original 80 stories were approved. The elevators were mechanically operated until 2011, when they were replaced with automatic elevators during the $550 million renovation of the building. An additional elevator connects the 86th and 102nd floor observatories, which allows visitors access to the 102nd floor observatory after having their tickets scanned. It also allows employees to access the mechanical floors located between the 87th and 101st floors.

====Observation decks====

The 80th, 86th, and 102nd floors contain observatories. The latter two observatories saw a combined average of four million visitors per year in 2010. Since opening, the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, the first One World Trade Center, or the Woolworth Building, despite being more expensive. There are variable charges to enter the observatories based on demand and time of day. Though most tickets allow visitors to go to the 86th floor, an additional fee is charged for access to the 102nd floor. Other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory, a &quot;premium&quot; guided tour with VIP access, and the &quot;AM/PM&quot; package which allows for two visits in the same day.

The 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open-air outdoor viewing area, allowing for it to remain open 365 days a year regardless of the weather. The 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size. The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005 due to limited viewing capacity and long lines. The observation decks were redesigned in mid-1979. The 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019, allowing the windows to be extended from floor to ceiling and widening the space in the observatory overall. An observatory on the 80th floor, opened in 2019, includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by British artist Stephen Wiltshire. An interactive multimedia museum, with multiple hands-on exhibitions about the building&#x27;s history, was added during this project. The design of the Observatory Experience was inspired by the plans and designs of the original Empire State Building.

According to a 2010 report by Concierge.com, the five lines to enter the observation decks are &quot;as legendary as the building itself&quot;. Concierge.com stated that there were five lines: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck. In 2016, New York City&#x27;s official tourism website made note of only three lines: the security check line, the ticket purchase line, and the second elevator line. Following renovations completed in 2019, designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times, guests enter from a single entrance on 34th Street, where they make their way through exhibits on their way up to the observatories. Guests were offered a variety of ticket packages, including a package that enables them to skip the lines throughout the duration of their stay. The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.

====New York Skyride====
In early 1994, a motion simulator attraction was built on the 2nd floor, as a complement to the observation deck. The original cinematic presentation lasted approximately 25 minutes, while the simulation was about eight minutes. The ride had two incarnations. The original version, which ran from 1994 until around 2002, featured James Doohan, &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; Scotty, as the airplane&#x27;s pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the ride was closed. An updated version debuted in mid-2002, featuring actor Kevin Bacon as the pilot, with the new flight also going haywire. This new version served a more informative goal, as opposed to the old version&#x27;s main purpose of entertainment, and contained details about the 9/11 attacks. The simulator received mixed reviews, with assessments of the ride ranging from &quot;great&quot; to &quot;satisfactory&quot; to &quot;corny&quot;.

===Spire===
====Above the 102nd floor====
The final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast, a steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities, above the 86th floor. The spire of the Empire State Building was originally intended to serve as a mooring mast for zeppelins and other airships, although the plan was abandoned after high winds made that impossible. At the top would be a conical roof and the 102nd-floor docking station. Inside, the elevators would ascend from the 86th-floor ticket offices to a 101st-floor waiting room. From there, stairs would lead to the 102nd floor, where passengers would enter the airships. The airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building&#x27;s 106th floor.

As constructed, the mast contains four rectangular tiers topped by a cylindrical shaft with a conical pinnacle. On the 102nd floor (formerly the 101st floor), there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor (formerly the 102nd). This was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the building&#x27;s spire, and has a circular balcony outside. It is now an access point to reach the spire for maintenance. The room now contains electrical equipment, but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there. A set of stairs and a ladder ascend to the spire and are used by maintenance workers. The mast&#x27;s 480 windows were all replaced in 2015. The mast serves as the base of the building&#x27;s broadcasting antenna.

Inflatable objects have sometimes been mounted to the spire for promotional purposes. For example, a King Kong balloon was attached to the spire in 1983 to mark the 50th anniversary of the character&#x27;s introduction, and an inflatable dragon was placed on the spire in 2024 to promote the TV series &quot;House of Dragon&quot;.

====Broadcast stations====
Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when NBC and RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the mast, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there. In 1934, RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building&#x27;s antenna. This setup, which entailed the installation of the world&#x27;s first FM transmitter, continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong. Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong&#x27;s transmitter was located.

After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA&#x27;s New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now WNBC channel 4). NBC&#x27;s FM station, W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the exclusive deal be terminated. The FCC directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York-area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Other television broadcasters would later join RCA at the building on the 81st through 83rd floors, often along with sister FM stations. Construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on July 27, 1950, with TV, and FM, transmissions starting in 1951. The broadcast tower was completed in 1953. From 1951, six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined $600,000 per year for the use of the antenna. In 1965, a separate set of FM antennae was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna.

The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center&#x27;s Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters&#x27; leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.

The September 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city&#x27;s stations without a transmitter for ten days until the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey, was re-activated temporarily. By October 2001, nearly all of the city&#x27;s commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that Congress commissioned about the transition from analog television to digital television, it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered &quot;problematic&quot; due to interference from nearby buildings. In comparison, the congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference. In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby Condé Nast Building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building. Eleven television stations and twenty-two FM stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in Bayonne, New Jersey, or Governors Island, would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a &quot;backup&quot; since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality. Following the construction of One World Trade Center in the late 2000s and early 2010s, some TV stations began moving their transmitting facilities there.

, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:
* Television: WABC-7, WPIX-11, WXTV-41 Paterson, and WFUT-68 Newark
* FM: WINS-92.3, WPAT-93.1 Paterson, WNYC-93.9, WPLJ-95.5, WXNY-96.3, WQHT-97.1, WSKQ-97.9, WEPN-98.7, WHTZ-100.3 Newark, WCBS-101.1, WFAN-101.9, WNEW-FM-102.7, WKTU-103.5 Lake Success, WAXQ-104.3, WWPR-105.1, WQXR-105.9 Newark, WLTW-106.7, and WBLS-107.5
* NOAA Weather Radio station KWO35 broadcasts at a frequency of 162.550 MHz from the National Weather Service in Upton, New York.

==History==
The site was previously owned by John Jacob Astor of the prominent Astor family, who had owned the site since the mid-1820s. In 1893, John Jacob Astor Sr.&#x27;s grandson William Waldorf Astor opened the Waldorf Hotel on the site. Four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The two portions of the Waldorf–Astoria hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. After the death of its founding proprietor, George Boldt, in early 1918, the hotel lease was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont. By the 1920s, the old Waldorf–Astoria was becoming dated and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north. Additionally, many stores had opened on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street. The Astor family decided to build a replacement hotel on Park Avenue and sold the hotel to Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in 1928 for $14–16 million. The hotel closed shortly thereafter on May 3, 1929.

===Planning===
==== Early plans ====
Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria site. The company&#x27;s president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1 million down payment required to start construction on the building, with the promise that the difference would be paid later. Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank but defaulted on the loan.

After Brown was unable to secure additional funding, the land was resold to Empire State Inc., a group of wealthy investors that included Louis G. Kaufman, Ellis P. Earle, John J. Raskob, Coleman du Pont, and Pierre S. du Pont. The name came from the state nickname for New York. Alfred E. Smith, a former Governor of New York and U.S. presidential candidate whose 1928 campaign had been managed by Raskob, was appointed head of the company. The group also purchased nearby land so they would have the needed for the base, with the combined plot measuring wide by long. The Empire State Inc. consortium was announced to the public in August 1929. Concurrently, Smith announced the construction of an 80-story building on the site, to be taller than any other buildings in existence.

Empire State Inc. contracted William F. Lamb, of architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, to create the building design. Lamb produced the initial building design using the firm&#x27;s earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the basis. He had also been inspired by Raymond Hood&#x27;s design for the Daily News Building, which was being constructed at the same time. Concurrently, Lamb&#x27;s partner Richmond Shreve created &quot;bug diagrams&quot; of the project requirements. The 1916 Zoning Act forced Lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors. Consequently, the building was conceived from the top down, giving it a pencil-like shape. The plans were devised within a budget of $50 million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy within 18 months of the start of construction. Design drawings and construction were concurrent. Steel drawings were completed in mid-January 1930, when foundations were underway.

==== Design changes ====

The original plan of the building was 50 stories, but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories. Height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned 80-story, building would have unobstructed views of the city. &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the site&#x27;s proximity to mass transit, with the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit&#x27;s 34th Street station and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad&#x27;s 33rd Street terminal one block away, as well as Penn Station two blocks away and Grand Central Terminal nine blocks away at its closest. It also praised the of proposed floor space near &quot;one of the busiest sections in the world&quot;. The Empire State Building was to be a typical office building, but Raskob intended to build it &quot;better and in a bigger way&quot;, according to architectural writer Donald J. Reynolds.

While plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of &quot;world&#x27;s tallest building&quot; was underway. 40 Wall Street (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building. The &quot;Race into the Sky&quot;, as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country&#x27;s optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities. The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from to making it the world&#x27;s tallest. The Chrysler Building added its steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street. The Chrysler Building&#x27;s developer, Walter Chrysler, realized that his tower&#x27;s height would exceed the Empire State Building&#x27;s as well, having instructed his architect, William Van Alen, to change the Chrysler&#x27;s original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire. Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world&#x27;s tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension. On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27–31 West 33rd Street, adding to the width of the proposed office building&#x27;s site. Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper. The plans included an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler&#x27;s 71st-floor observation deck.

The 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be taller than the Chrysler Building, and Raskob was afraid that Chrysler might try to &quot;pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.&quot; The plans were revised one last time in December 1929, to include a 16-story, metal &quot;crown&quot; and an additional mooring mast intended for dirigibles. The roof height was now , making it the tallest building in the world by far, even without the antenna. The addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor, the 86th, would have to be built below the crown; however, unlike the Chrysler&#x27;s spire, the Empire State&#x27;s mast would serve a practical purpose. A revised plan was announced to the public in late December 1929, just before the start of construction. The final plan was sketched within two hours, the night before the plan was supposed to be presented to the site&#x27;s owners in January 1930. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the spire was facing some &quot;technical problems&quot;, but they were &quot;no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan.&quot; By this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved. Lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final, approved plan:

=== Construction ===
The contractors were Starrett Brothers and Eken, which were composed of Paul and William A. Starrett and Andrew J. Eken. The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont, while James Farley&#x27;s General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials. John W. Bowser was the construction superintendent of the project, and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom. The tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be finalized.

==== Hotel demolition ====
Demolition of the old Waldorf–Astoria began on October 1, 1929. Stripping the building down was an arduous process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been. Furthermore, the old hotel&#x27;s granite, wood chips, and &quot;&#x27;precious&#x27; metals such as lead, brass, and zinc&quot; were not in high demand, resulting in issues with disposal. Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

By the time the hotel&#x27;s demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building. The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange experienced the major and sudden Wall Street Crash, marking the beginning of the decade-long Great Depression. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob, who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash. However, most of the investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a $27.5 million loan from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company so construction could begin. The stock market crash resulted in no demand for new office space; Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction, as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.

==== Steel structure ====
A structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930, with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on January 22, before the old hotel had been completely demolished. Two twelve-hour shifts, consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the deep foundation. Small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork. Excavation was nearly complete by early March, and construction on the building itself started on March 17, with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished. Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows, the large-block Indiana Limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks, and the building&#x27;s vertical lines. Four colossal columns, intended for installation in the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined when the building was finished.

The structural steel was pre-ordered and pre-fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city&#x27;s building code that would have allowed the Empire State Building&#x27;s structural steel to carry , up from , thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence. The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930. From there, construction proceeded at a rapid pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors. This was made possible through precise coordination of the building&#x27;s planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels. On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.

The scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying &quot;16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, of sand and 300 bags of lime&quot; arriving at the construction site every day. There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch. Temporary water taps were installed so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level. Carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks. The of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined. According to historian John Tauranac, building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with &quot;limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [and] hardware from New England.&quot; The facade, too, used a variety of material—most prominently Indiana limestone but also architectural terracotta, brick, and black granite from Sweden.

By June 20, the skyscraper&#x27;s supporting steel structure had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the steel structure had been completed. Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction, achieving a pace of four and a half stories per week; prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been three and a half stories per week. While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up (as opposed to the general design, which had been from the roof down). Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized. On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building&#x27;s cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands. The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot;, a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction. The steel structure was topped out at on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of construction. Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.

==== Completion and scale ====

Work on the building&#x27;s interior and crowning mast commenced after the topping out. The mooring mast topped out on November 21, two months after the steelwork had been completed. Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor. The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November. Because of the building&#x27;s height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at , which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.

In addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building&#x27;s first floor and basements. Concrete mixers, brick hoppers, and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public. At one point, over 200 trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day. A series of relay and erection derricks, placed on platforms erected near the building, lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations. The Empire State Building was structurally completed on April 11, 1931, twelve days ahead of schedule and 410 days after construction commenced. Al Smith shot the final rivet, which was made of solid gold.

The project involved more than 3,500 workers at its peak, including 3,439 on a single day, August 14, 1930. Many of the workers were Irish and Italian immigrants, with a sizable minority of Mohawk ironworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction, although the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave reports of 14 deaths and a headline in the socialist magazine &quot;The New Masses&quot; spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths. The Empire State Building cost $40,948,900 to build (equivalent to $ in ), including demolition of the Waldorf–Astoria. This was lower than the $60 million budgeted for construction.

Lewis Hine captured many photographs of the construction, documenting not only the work itself but also providing insight into the daily life of workers in that era. Hine&#x27;s images were used extensively by the media to publish daily press releases. According to the writer Jim Rasenberger, Hine &quot;climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture, as no one ever had before (or has since), the dizzy work of building skyscrapers&quot;. In Rasenberger&#x27;s words, Hine turned what might have been an assignment of &quot;corporate flak&quot; into &quot;exhilarating art&quot;. These images were later organized into their own collection. Onlookers were enraptured by the sheer height at which the steelworkers operated. &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote of the steelworkers: &quot;Like little spiders they toiled, spinning a fabric of steel against the sky&quot;.

===Opening and early years===

The Empire State Building officially opened on May 1, 1931, forty-five days ahead of its projected opening date, and eighteen months from the start of construction. The opening was marked with an event featuring United States President Herbert Hoover, who turned on the building&#x27;s lights with the ceremonial button push from Washington, D.C. Over 350 guests attended the opening ceremony, and following luncheon, at the 86th floor including Jimmy Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Al Smith. An account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog, with other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty being &quot;lost in the mist&quot; enveloping New York City. The Empire State Building officially opened the next day. Advertisements for the building&#x27;s observatories were placed in local newspapers, while nearby hotels also capitalized on the events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to the newly opened building.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, builders and real estate speculators predicted that the Empire State Building would be the world&#x27;s tallest building &quot;for many years&quot;, thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry. At the time, most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than , even with the hardy Manhattan bedrock as a foundation. Technically, it was believed possible to build a tower of up to , but it was deemed uneconomical to do so, especially during the Great Depression. As the tallest building in the world, at that time, and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building became an icon of the city and, ultimately, of the nation.

In 1932, the Fifth Avenue Association gave the building its 1931 &quot;gold medal&quot; for architectural excellence, signifying that the Empire State had been the best-designed building on Fifth Avenue to open in 1931. A year later, on March 2, 1933, the movie &quot;King Kong&quot; was released. The movie, which depicted a large stop motion ape named Kong climbing the Empire State Building, made the still-new building into a cinematic icon.

==== Tenants and tourism ====
At the beginning of 1931, Fifth Avenue was experiencing high demand for storefront space, with only 12 of 224 stores being unoccupied. The Empire State Building, along with 500 Fifth Avenue and 608 Fifth Avenue, were expected to add a combined 11 stores. The office space was less successful, as the Empire State Building&#x27;s opening had coincided with the Great Depression in the United States. In the first year, only 23 percent of the available space was rented, as compared to the early 1920s, where the average building would be 52 percent occupied upon opening and 90 percent occupied within five years. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the &quot;Empty State Building&quot; or &quot;Smith&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

The earliest tenants in the Empire State Building were large companies, banks, and garment industries. Jack Brod, one of the building&#x27;s longest resident tenants, co-established the Empire Diamond Corporation with his father in the building in mid-1931 and rented space in the building until he died in 2008. Brod recalled that there were only about 20 tenants at the time of opening, including him, and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor offices. Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in the building, despite Smith&#x27;s and Raskob&#x27;s aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew. The building&#x27;s lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from Rockefeller Center as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during the 1930s.

Aggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce the Empire State Building&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s tallest. The observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets. The building became a popular tourist attraction, with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in 1931. In its first year of operation, the observation deck made approximately $2 million in revenue, as much as its owners made in rent that year. By 1936, the observation deck was crowded on a daily basis, with food and drink available for purchase at the top, and by 1944 the building had received its five-millionth visitor. In 1931, NBC took up tenancy, leasing space on the 85th floor for radio broadcasts. From the outset the building was in debt, losing $1 million per year by 1935. Real estate developer Seymour Durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above the 45th floor, as the building above the 41st floor was empty except for the NBC offices and the Raskob/Du Pont offices on the 81st floor.

==== Other events ====
Per the original plans, the Empire State Building&#x27;s spire was intended to be an airship docking station. Raskob and Smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th floor, while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building&#x27;s 106th floor. An elevator would ferry passengers from the 86th to the 101st floor after they had checked in on the 86th floor, after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board the airship. The idea was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by the building itself, the wind currents across Manhattan, and the spires of nearby skyscrapers. Even if the airship could successfully navigate all these obstacles, its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability, and then tie the craft&#x27;s nose to the spire with no mooring lines securing the tail end of the craft. On September 15, 1931, a small commercial United States Navy airship circled 25 times in winds. The airship then attempted to dock at the mast, but its ballast spilled and the craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies. The near-disaster scuttled plans to turn the building&#x27;s spire into an airship terminal, although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward.

On July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors. One engine completely penetrated the building and landed in a neighboring block, while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. Fourteen people were killed in the incident, but the building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later.

===Profitability===
By the 1940s, the Empire State Building was 98 percent occupied. The structure broke even for the first time in the 1950s. At the time, mass transit options in the building&#x27;s vicinity were limited compared to the present day. Despite this challenge, the Empire State Building began to attract renters due to its reputation. A radio antenna was erected on top of the towers starting in 1950, allowing the area&#x27;s television stations to be broadcast from the building.

Despite the turnaround in the building&#x27;s fortunes, Raskob listed it for sale in 1951, with a minimum asking price of $50 million. The property was purchased by business partners Roger L. Stevens, Henry Crown, Alfred R. Glancy and Ben Tobin. The sale was brokered by the Charles F. Noyes Company, a prominent real estate firm in upper Manhattan, for $51 million, the highest price paid for a single structure at the time. By this time, the Empire State had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in the building, according to the &quot;Cortland Standard&quot;. That same year, six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of $600,000 to use the building&#x27;s antenna, which was completed in 1953. Crown bought out his partners&#x27; ownership stakes in 1954, becoming the sole owner. The following year, the American Society of Civil Engineers named the building one of the &quot;Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders&quot;.

In 1961, Lawrence A. Wien signed a contract to purchase the Empire State Building for $65 million, with Harry B. Helmsley acting as partners in the building&#x27;s operating lease. This became the new highest price for a single structure. Over 3,000 people paid $10,000 for one share each in a company called Empire State Building Associates. The company in turn subleased the building to another company headed by Helmsley and Wien, raising $33 million of the funds needed to pay the purchase price. In a separate transaction, the land underneath the building was sold to Prudential Insurance for $29 million. Helmsley, Wien, and Peter Malkin quickly started a program of minor improvement projects, including the first-ever full-building facade refurbishment and window-washing in 1962, the installation of new flood lights on the 72nd floor in 1964, and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in 1966. The little-used western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until 1964, at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area.

===Loss of &quot;tallest building&quot; title===
In 1961, the same year that Helmsley, Wien, and Malkin had purchased the Empire State Building, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey formally backed plans for a new World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The plan originally included 66-story twin towers with column-free open spaces. The Empire State&#x27;s owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers&#x27; of office space would create a glut of rentable space in Manhattan as well as take away the Empire State Building&#x27;s profits from lessees. A revision in the World Trade Center&#x27;s plan brought the twin towers to each or 110 stories, taller than the Empire State. Opponents of the new project included prominent real-estate developer Robert Tishman, as well as Wien&#x27;s Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center. In response to Wien&#x27;s opposition, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin said that Wien was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his Empire State Building as the world&#x27;s tallest building.

The World Trade Center&#x27;s twin towers started construction in 1966. The following year, the Ostankino Tower succeeded the Empire State Building as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. In 1970, the Empire State surrendered its position as the world&#x27;s tallest building, when the World Trade Center&#x27;s still-under-construction North Tower surpassed it, on October 19; the North Tower was topped out on December 23, 1970.

In December 1975, the observation deck was opened on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers, significantly higher than the 86th floor observatory on the Empire State Building. The latter was also losing revenue during this period, particularly as a number of broadcast stations had moved to the World Trade Center in 1971; although the Port Authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the Empire State until 1984. The Empire State Building was still seen as prestigious, having seen its forty-millionth visitor in March 1971.

===1980s and 1990s===
By 1980, there were nearly two million annual visitors, although a building official had previously estimated between 1.5 million and 1.75 million annual visitors. The building received its own ZIP code in May 1980 in a roll out of 63 new postal codes in Manhattan. At the time, its tenants collectively received 35,000 pieces of mail daily. The Empire State Building celebrated its 50th anniversary on May 1, 1981, with a much-publicized, but poorly received, laser light show, as well as an &quot;Empire State Building Week&quot; that ran through to May 8. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on May 19, 1981,

Capital improvements were made to the Empire State Building during the early to mid-1990s at a cost of $55 million. Because all of the building&#x27;s windows were being replaced at the same time, the LPC mandated a paint-color test for the windows; the test revealed that the Empire State Building&#x27;s original windows were actually red. The improvements also entailed replacing alarm systems, elevators, windows, and air conditioning; making the observation deck compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); and refurbishing the limestone facade. The observation deck renovation was added after disability rights groups and the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the building in 1992, in what was the first lawsuit filed by an organization under the new law. A settlement was reached in 1994, in which Empire State Building Associates agreed to add ADA-compliant elements, such as new elevators, ramps, and automatic doors, during the renovation.

Prudential sold the land under the building in 1991 for $42 million to a buyer representing hotelier , who was imprisoned at the time in connection with the deadly at the in Tokyo. In 1994, Donald Trump entered into a joint-venture agreement with Yokoi, with a shared goal of breaking the Empire State Building&#x27;s lease on the land in an effort to gain total ownership of the building so that, if successful, the two could reap the potential profits of merging the ownership of the building with the land beneath it. Having secured a half-ownership of the land, Trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it, even though Helmsley and Malkin had already started their refurbishment project. He sued Empire State Building Associates in February 1995, claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a &quot;high-rise slum&quot; and a &quot;second-rate, rodent-infested&quot; office tower. Trump had intended to have Empire State Building Associates evicted for violating the terms of their lease, but was denied. This led to Helmsley&#x27;s companies countersuing Trump in May. This sparked a series of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years, partly arising from Trump&#x27;s desire to obtain the building&#x27;s master lease by taking it from Empire State Building Associates. Upon Harry Helmsley&#x27;s death in 1997, the Malkins sued Helmsley&#x27;s widow, Leona Helmsley, for control of the building.

=== 21st century ===
====2000s====
Following the destruction of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, but was only the second-tallest building in the Americas after the Sears (later Willis) Tower in Chicago. As a result of the attacks, transmissions from nearly all of the city&#x27;s commercial television and FM radio stations were again broadcast from the Empire State Building. The attacks also led to an increase in security due to persistent terror threats against prominent sites in New York City.

In 2002, Trump and Yokoi sold their land claim to the Empire State Building Associates, now headed by Malkin, in a $57.5 million transaction. This action merged the building&#x27;s title and lease for the first time in half a century. Despite the lingering threat posed by the 9/11 attacks, the Empire State Building remained popular with 3.5 million visitors to the observatories in 2004, compared to about 2.8 million in 2003.

Even though she maintained her ownership stake in the building until the post-consolidation IPO in October 2013, Leona Helmsley handed over day-to-day operations of the building in 2006 to Peter Malkin&#x27;s company. In 2008, the building was temporarily &quot;stolen&quot; by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; to show how easy it was to transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of &quot;King Kong&quot;, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber. The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.

====2010s to present====

Starting in 2009, the building&#x27;s public areas received a $550 million renovation, with improvements to the air conditioning and waterproofing, renovations to the observation deck and main lobby, and relocation of the gift shop to the 80th floor. About $120 million was spent on improving the energy efficiency of the building, with the goal of reducing energy emissions by 38% within five years. For example, all of the windows were refurbished onsite into film-coated &quot;superwindows&quot; which block heat but pass light. Air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced, saving $17 million of the project&#x27;s capital cost immediately and partially funding some of the other retrofits. The Empire State Building won the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold for Existing Buildings rating in September 2011, as well as the World Federation of Great Towers&#x27; Excellence in Environment Award for 2010. For the LEED Gold certification, the building&#x27;s energy reduction was considered, as was a large purchase of carbon offsets. Other factors included low-flow bathroom fixtures, green cleaning supplies, and use of recycled paper products.

On April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center topped out, surpassing the Empire State Building as the city&#x27;s tallest skyscraper. By 2014, the building was owned by the Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT), with Anthony Malkin as chairman, CEO, and president. The ESRT was a public company, having begun trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange the previous year. In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) was issued new fully diluted shares equivalent to 9.9% of the trust; this investment gave them partial ownership of the entirety of the ESRT&#x27;s portfolio, and as a result, partial ownership of the Empire State Building. The trust&#x27;s president John Kessler called it an &quot;endorsement of the company&#x27;s irreplaceable assets&quot;. The investment has been described by the real-estate magazine &quot;The Real Deal&quot; as &quot;an unusual move for a sovereign wealth fund&quot;, as these funds typically buy direct stakes in buildings rather than real estate companies. Other foreign entities that have a stake in the ESRT include investors from Norway, Japan, and Australia.

A renovation of the Empire State Building was commenced in the 2010s to further improve energy efficiency, public areas, and amenities. In August 2018, to improve the flow of visitor traffic, the main visitor&#x27;s entrance was shifted to 20 West 34th Street as part of a major renovation of the observatory lobby. The new lobby includes several technological features, including large LED panels, digital ticket kiosks in nine languages, and a two-story architectural model of the building surrounded by two metal staircases. The first phase of the renovation, completed in 2019, features an updated exterior lighting system and digital hosts. The new lobby also features free Wi-Fi provided for those waiting. A exhibit with nine galleries opened in July 2019. The 102nd floor observatory, the third phase of the redesign, reopened to the public on October 12, 2019. That portion of the project included outfitting the space with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a brand-new glass elevator. The final portion of the renovations to be completed was a new observatory on the 80th floor, which opened on December 2, 2019. In total, the renovation cost $160 million or $165 million and took four years to finish.

A comprehensive restoration of the building&#x27;s mooring and antenna masts also began in June 2019. Antennas on the mooring mast were removed or relocated to the upper mast, while the aluminum panels were cleaned and coated with silver paint. To minimize disruption to the observation decks, the restoration work took place at night. The project was completed by late 2020.

==Height records==
The longest world record held by the Empire State Building was for the tallest skyscraper (to structural height), which it held for 42 years until it was surpassed by the North Tower of the World Trade Center in October 1970. The Empire State Building was also the tallest human-made structure in the world before it was surpassed by the Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma (KWTV Mast) in 1954, and the tallest freestanding structure in the world until the completion of the Ostankino Tower in 1967. An early-1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors, which would have brought the building&#x27;s height to 1,494 feet (455 m) and made it once again the world&#x27;s tallest at the time, was considered but ultimately rejected.

With the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, and the second-tallest building in the Americas, surpassed only by the Willis Tower in Chicago. The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in New York until the new One World Trade Center reached a greater height in April 2012. , it is the seventh-tallest building in New York City and the tenth-tallest in the United States. The Empire State Building is the 49th-tallest in the world . It is also the eleventh-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas behind the tallest U.S. buildings and the CN Tower.

== Notable tenants ==
, the building housed around 1,000 businesses. Current tenants include:
Former tenants include:
* The National Catholic Welfare Council (now Catholic Relief Services, located in Baltimore)
* The King&#x27;s College (now located at 56 Broadway)
* China National Tourist Office (now located at 370 Lexington Avenue)
* National Film Board of Canada (now located at 1123 Broadway)
* Nathaniel Branden Institute
* Schenley Industries
* YWCA of the USA (relocated to Washington, DC)

==Incidents==

===1945 plane crash===

At 9:40 am on July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr., crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors (then the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council). One engine completely penetrated the building, landing on the roof of a nearby building where it started a fire that destroyed a penthouse. The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft, causing a fire that was extinguished in 40 minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver fell 75 stories and survived, which still holds the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.

Despite the damage and loss of life, many floors were open two days later. The crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the incident. Also as a result of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Administration enacted strict regulations regarding flying over New York City, setting a minimum flying altitude of above sea level regardless of the weather conditions.

A year later, on July 24, 1946, another airplane narrowly missed striking the building. The unidentified twin-engine plane scraped past the observation deck, frightening the tourists there.

=== 2000 elevator plunge ===
On January 24, 2000, an elevator in the building suddenly descended 40 stories after a cable that controlled the cabin&#x27;s maximum speed was severed. The elevator fell from the 44th floor to the fourth floor, where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system. Despite the 40-floor fall, both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured. After the fall, building inspectors reviewed all of the building&#x27;s elevators.

===Suicide attempts===
Because of the building&#x27;s iconic status, it and other Midtown landmarks are common locations for suicide attempts. More than 30 people have attempted suicide over the years by jumping from the upper parts of the building, with most attempts being successful.

The first suicide from the building occurred on April 7, 1931, before it was even completed, when a carpenter who had been laid-off went to the 58th floor and jumped. The first suicide after the building&#x27;s opening occurred from the 86th floor observatory in February 1935, when Irma P. Eberhardt fell onto a marquee sign. On December 16, 1943, William Lloyd Rambo jumped to his death from the 86th floor, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below. In the early morning of September 27, 1946, shell-shocked Marine Douglas W. Brashear Jr. jumped from the 76th-floor window of the Grant Advertising Agency; police found his shoes from his body.

On May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale&#x27;s oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: &quot;He is much better off without me... I wouldn&#x27;t make a good wife for anybody&quot;. The photo ran in the May 12, 1947, edition of &quot;Life&quot; magazine and is often referred to as &quot;The Most Beautiful Suicide&quot;. It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled &quot;Suicide (Fallen Body)&quot;. A mesh fence was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span in October and November of that year. By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.

Only one person has jumped from the upper observatory. Frederick Eckert of Astoria ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd-floor gallery on November 3, 1932, and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers. He landed and died on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade.

Two people have survived falls by not falling more than a floor. On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor, only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip. On April 25, 2013, a man fell from the 86th floor observation deck, but he landed alive with minor injuries on an 85th-floor ledge where security guards brought him inside and paramedics transferred him to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

===Shootings===
Two fatal shootings have occurred in the direct vicinity of the Empire State Building. Abu Kamal, a 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, shot seven people on the 86th floor observation deck during the afternoon of February 23, 1997. He killed one person and wounded six others before committing suicide. Kamal reportedly committed the shooting in response to events happening in Palestine and Israel.

On the morning of August 24, 2012, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson shot and killed a former co-worker on the building&#x27;s Fifth Avenue sidewalk. He had been laid off from his job in 2011. Two police officers confronted the gunman, and he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders. Most of the injured were hit by bullet fragments, although three took direct hits from bullets.

== Impact ==

As the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation. In 2013, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that the Empire State Building &quot;seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with&quot;. The historian John Tauranac called it &quot;&#x27;the&#x27; twentieth-century New York building&quot;, despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on May 19, 1981, citing the historic nature of the first and second floors, as well as &quot;the fixtures and interior components&quot; of the upper floors. The New York City Planning Commission endorsed the landmark status. The building became a National Historic Landmark in 1986 in close alignment with the New York City Landmarks report. The Empire State Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year due to its architectural significance.

=== Contemporary reception ===
Early architectural critics also focused on the Empire State Building&#x27;s exterior ornamentation. Architectural critic Talbot Hamlin wrote in 1931, &quot;That it is the world&#x27;s tallest building is purely incidental.&quot; George Shepard Chappell, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;T-Square&quot;, wrote the same year that the Empire State Building had a &quot;palpably enormous&quot; appeal to the general public, and that &quot;its difference and distinction [lay] in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design&quot;. Edmund Wilson of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that the building&#x27;s neutral color palette made it &quot;New York&#x27;s handsomest skyscraper&quot;.

Architectural critics also wrote negatively of the mast, especially in light of its failure to become a real air terminal. Chappell called the mast &quot;a silly gesture&quot;, and Lewis Mumford called it &quot;a public comfort station for migratory birds&quot;. Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building&#x27;s appeal came from the fact that it was &quot;caught at the exact moment of transition—caught between metal and stone, between the idea of &#x27;monumental mass&#x27; and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.&quot;

===As icon===
Early in the building&#x27;s history, travel companies such as Short Line Motor Coach Service and New York Central Railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city. In a 1932 survey of 50 American architects, fourteen ranked the Empire State Building as the United States&#x27; best building; the Empire State Building received more votes than any building except the Lincoln Memorial. After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect Paul Goldberger noted that the Empire State Building &quot;is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good.&quot;

As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was &quot;America&#x27;s favorite building&quot;. The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants. The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was &quot;a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans.&quot; The architectural critic Jonathan Glancey refers to the building as an &quot;icon of American design&quot;. Additionally, in 2007, the Empire State Building was first on the AIA&#x27;s List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture.

The Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a &quot;wonder of the world&quot; due to the massive effort expended during construction. &quot;The Washington Star&quot; listed it as part of one of the &quot;seven wonders of the modern world&quot; in 1931, while &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State&#x27;s height would be taller than the combined heights of the Eiffel Tower and the Great Pyramid of Giza. The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building &quot;A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States&quot; in 1958 and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World in 1994. Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the &quot;seven wonders of engineering&quot;. It has often been called the Eighth Wonder of the World as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening. The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building also became the standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures globally, both natural and human-made.

The building has also inspired replicas. The New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the &quot;Empire Tower&quot;, a 47-story replica of the Empire State Building. A portion of the hotel&#x27;s interior was also designed to resemble the Empire State Building&#x27;s interior.

===In media===
As an icon of New York City, the Empire State Building has been featured in various films, books, TV shows, and video games. According to the building&#x27;s official website, more than 250 movies contain depictions of the Empire State Building. In his book about the building, John Tauranac writes that its first documented appearance in popular culture was &quot;Swiss Family Manhattan&quot;, a 1932 children&#x27;s story by Christopher Morley. A year later, the film &quot;King Kong&quot; depicted Kong, a giant stop motion ape that climbs the Empire State Building during the film&#x27;s climax, bringing the building into the popular imagination. Later movies such as &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), and &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) also prominently featured the building. The building has also been featured in other works, such as &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot;, a 2007 episode of the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; and &quot;Empire&quot;, an eight-hour black-and-white silent film by Andy Warhol, which was later added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry.

Throughout its history, the Empire State Building has welcomed celebrities, royalty, and dignitaries to visit the observation deck. From celebrities like Taylor Swift and Zendaya to royalty such as Prince William, the Empire State Building hosts notable figures every year.

===Empire State Building Run-Up===
The Empire State Building Run-Up, a foot race from ground level to the 86th-floor observation deck, has been held annually since 1978. It is organized by NYCRUNS. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often tower running enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9 minutes and 33 seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist Paul Crake in 2003, at a climbing rate of per hour.

<doc id="9737" wikidata="Q170480" url="?curid=9737" title="Eugenics">
<text>Eugenics ( ; ) is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population. Historically, eugenicists have attempted to alter the frequency of various human phenotypes by inhibiting the fertility of people and groups they considered inferior, or promoting that of those considered superior.
The contemporary history of eugenics began in the late 19th century, when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the United Kingdom, and then spread to many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and most European countries (e.g. Sweden and Germany). In this period, people from across the political spectrum espoused eugenic ideas. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies, intended to improve the quality of their populations&#x27; genetic stock.

Historically, the idea of &quot;eugenics&quot; has been used to argue for a broad array of practices ranging from prenatal care for mothers deemed genetically desirable to the forced sterilization and murder of those deemed unfit. To population geneticists, the term has included the avoidance of inbreeding without altering allele frequencies; for example, British-Indian scientist J. B. S. Haldane wrote in 1940 that &quot;the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent.&quot; Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics continues today. Early eugenicists were mostly concerned with factors of measured intelligence that often correlated strongly with social class.

Although it originated as a progressive social movement in the 19th century, in contemporary usage in the 21st century, the term is closely associated with scientific racism. New, liberal eugenics seeks to dissociate itself from old, authoritarian eugenics by rejecting coercive state programs and relying on parental choice.

== Common distinctions ==
 Eugenic programs included both &quot;positive&quot; measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly &quot;fit&quot; to reproduce, and &quot;negative&quot; measures, such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction.

In other words, positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged, for example, the eminently intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally &quot;undesirable&quot;. This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; in Nazi Germany, for example, abortion was illegal for women deemed by the state to be fit.

===As opposed to &quot;euthenics&quot;===

==Historical eugenics==
=== Ancient and medieval origins===
=== Academic origins ===
The term &quot;eugenics&quot; and its modern field of study were first formulated by Francis Galton in 1883, directly drawing on the recent work delineating natural selection by his half-cousin Charles Darwin. He published his observations and conclusions chiefly in his influential book &quot;Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development&quot;. Galton himself defined it as &quot;the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations&quot;. The first to systematically apply Darwinism theory to human relations, Galton believed that various desirable human qualities were also hereditary ones, although Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory.

Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from various sources. Organizations were formed to win public support for and to sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British Eugenics Education Society of 1907 and the American Eugenics Society of 1921. Both sought support from leading clergymen and modified their message to meet religious ideals. In 1909, the Anglican clergymen William Inge and James Peile both wrote for the Eugenics Education Society. Inge was an invited speaker at the 1921 International Eugenics Conference, which was also endorsed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York Patrick Joseph Hayes.

Three International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenicists, with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York City. Eugenic policies in the United States were first implemented by state-level legislators in the early 1900s. Eugenic policies also took root in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in other countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Sweden.

Frederick Osborn&#x27;s 1937 journal article &quot;Development of a Eugenic Philosophy&quot; framed eugenics as a social philosophy—a philosophy with implications for social order. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of sexual reproduction among people with desired traits (&quot;positive eugenics&quot;) or reduced rates of sexual reproduction or sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits (&quot;negative eugenics&quot;).

In addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations. Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, the Cold Spring Harbor Carnegie Institution for Experimental Evolution, and the Eugenics Record Office. Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws. In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness. Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure &quot;Nordic race&quot; or &quot;Aryan&quot; genetic pool and the eventual elimination of &quot;unfit&quot; races.

Many leading British politicians subscribed to the theories of eugenics. Winston Churchill supported the British Eugenics Society and was an honorary vice president for the organization. Churchill believed that eugenics could solve &quot;race deterioration&quot; and reduce crime and poverty.

As a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, birth control, promoting differential birth rates, marriage restrictions, segregation (both racial segregation and sequestering the mentally ill), compulsory sterilization, forced abortions or forced pregnancies, ultimately culminating in genocide. By 2014, gene selection (rather than &quot;people selection&quot;) was made possible through advances in genome editing, leading to what is sometimes called &quot;new eugenics&quot;, also known as &quot;neo-eugenics&quot;, &quot;consumer eugenics&quot;, or &quot;liberal eugenics&quot;; which focuses on individual freedom and allegedly pulls away from racism, sexism or a focus on intelligence.

====Early opposition====
Early critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist Lester Frank Ward, the English writer G. K. Chesterton, and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author Halliday Sutherland. Ward&#x27;s 1913 article &quot;Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics&quot;, Chesterton&#x27;s 1917 book , and Franz Boas&#x27; 1916 article &quot;&quot; (published in &quot;The Scientific Monthly&quot;) were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement.

Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including Lancelot Hogben. Other biologists who were themselves eugenicists, such as J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher, however, also expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of &quot;defectives&quot; (i.e. a purely negative eugenics) would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.

Among institutions, the Catholic Church was an opponent of state-enforced sterilizations, but accepted isolating people with hereditary diseases so as not to let them reproduce. Attempts by the Eugenics Education Society to persuade the British government to legalize voluntary sterilization were opposed by Catholics and by the Labour Party. The American Eugenics Society initially gained some Catholic supporters, but Catholic support declined following the 1930 papal encyclical &quot;Casti connubii&quot;. In this, Pope Pius XI explicitly condemned sterilization laws: &quot;Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects; therefore, where no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, they can never directly harm, or tamper with the integrity of the body, either for the reasons of eugenics or for any other reason.&quot;

In fact, more generally, &quot;[m]uch of the opposition to eugenics during that era, at least in Europe, came from the right.&quot; The eugenicists&#x27; political successes in Germany and Scandinavia were not at all matched in such countries as Poland and Czechoslovakia, even though measures had been proposed there, largely because of the Catholic church&#x27;s moderating influence.

===Nazism and the decline of eugenics ===
The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst Rüdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of &quot;defectives&quot; that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power. Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, promiscuous women, homosexuals, and racial groups (such as the Roma and Jews in Nazi Germany) as &quot;degenerate&quot; or &quot;unfit&quot;, and therefore led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, and even mass murder. The Nazi policy of identifying German citizens deemed mentally or physically unfit and then systematically killing them with poison gas, referred to as the Aktion T4 campaign, is understood by historians to have paved the way for the Holocaust.

By the end of World War II, many eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with Nazi Germany. H. G. Wells, who had called for &quot;the sterilization of failures&quot; in 1904, stated in his 1940 book &quot;The Rights of Man: Or What Are We Fighting For?&quot; that among the human rights, which he believed should be available to all people, was &quot;a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment&quot;. After World War II, the practice of &quot;imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group&quot; fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also proclaims &quot;the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons&quot;.

=== In Singapore ===

Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore, actively promoted eugenics as late as 1983. In 1984, Singapore began providing financial incentives to highly educated women to encourage them to have more children. For this purpose was introduced the &quot;Graduate Mother Scheme&quot; that incentivized graduate women to get married as much as the rest of their populace. The incentives were extremely unpopular and regarded as eugenic, and were seen as discriminatory towards Singapore&#x27;s non-Chinese ethnic population. In 1985, the incentives were partly abandoned as ineffective, while the government matchmaking agency, the Social Development Network, remains active.

== Modern eugenics ==
Developments in genetic, genomic, and reproductive technologies at the beginning of the 21st century have raised numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, sparking renewed interest in the topic.

Liberal eugenics, also called new eugenics, aims to make genetic interventions morally acceptable by rejecting coercive state programs and relying on parental choice. Bioethicist Nicholas Agar, who coined the term, argues for example that the state should intervene only to forbid interventions that excessively limit a child’s ability to shape their own future. Unlike &quot;authoritarian&quot; or &quot;old&quot; eugenics, liberal eugenics draws on modern scientific knowledge of genomics to enable informed choices aimed at improving well-being. Julien Savulescu further argues that some eugenic practices, like prenatal screening for Down syndrome, are already widely practiced, without being labeled &quot;eugenics&quot;, as they are seen as enhancing freedom rather than restricting it.

Some critics, such as UC Berkeley sociologist Troy Duster, have argued that modern genetics is a &quot;back door to eugenics&quot;. This view was shared by then-White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, Tania Simoncelli, who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at Hampshire College that advances in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are moving society to a &quot;new era of eugenics&quot;, and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, &quot;where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products&quot;. The United Nations&#x27; International Bioethics Committee also noted that while human genetic engineering should not be confused with the 20th century eugenics movements, it nonetheless challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want or cannot afford the technology.

In 2025, geneticist Peter Visscher published a paper in &quot;Nature,&quot; arguing genome editing of human embryos and germ cells may become feasible in the 21st century, and raising ethical considerations in the context of previous eugenics movements. A response argued that human embryo genetic editing is &quot;unsafe and unproven&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot; also published an editorial, stating: &quot;The fear that polygenic gene editing could be used for eugenics looms large among them, and is, in part, why no country currently allows genome editing in a human embryo, even for single variants&quot;.

== Contested scientific status ==

One general concern that many bring to the table, is that the reduced genetic diversity some argue to be a likely feature of long-term, species-wide eugenics plans, could eventually result in inbreeding depression, increased spread of infectious disease, and decreased resilience to changes in the environment.

===Arguments for scientific validity===

In his original lecture &quot;Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics&quot;, Karl Pearson claimed that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. Anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička said in 1918 that &quot;[t]he growing science of eugenics will essentially become applied anthropology.&quot; The economist John Maynard Keynes was a lifelong proponent of eugenics and described it as a branch of sociology.

In a 2006 newspaper article, Richard Dawkins said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.

===Objections to scientific validity ===
Amanda Caleb, Professor of Medical Humanities at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, says &quot;Eugenic laws and policies are now understood as part of a specious devotion to a pseudoscience that actively dehumanizes to support political agendas and not true science or medicine.&quot;

The first major challenge to conventional eugenics based on genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He demonstrated the event of genetic mutation occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a fruit fly (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;) with white eyes from a family with red eyes, demonstrating that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance. Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that certain traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were hereditary because these traits were subjective.

Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits, an example being phenylketonuria, which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect. Andrzej Pękalski, from the University of Wroclaw, argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pękalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with myopia from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.

While the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point there is no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some conditions such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to cholera when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual, so eliminating these genes is undesirable in places where such diseases are common.

Edwin Black, journalist, historian, and author of &quot;War Against the Weak&quot;, argues that eugenics is often deemed a pseudoscience because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry. This aspect of eugenics is often considered to be tainted with scientific racism and pseudoscience.
==Contested ethical status==

===Contemporary ethical opposition===

In a book directly addressed at socialist eugenicist J.B.S. Haldane and his once-influential &quot;Daedalus&quot;, Betrand Russell had one serious objection of his own: eugenic policies might simply end up being used to reproduce existing power relations &quot;rather than to make men happy.&quot;

Environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued against germinal choice technology and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to &quot;improve&quot; themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, he argues, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish as examples.

===Contemporary ethical advocacy===
Bioethicist Stephen Wilkinsonhas said that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral.

Historian Nathaniel C. Comfort has claimed that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making process from the state to patients and their families. 

In their book published in 2000, &quot;From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice&quot;, bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals&#x27; reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.

==In science fiction ==

The novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; by the English author Aldous Huxley (1931), is a dystopian social science fiction novel which is set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy.

Various works by the author Robert A. Heinlein mention the Howard Foundation, a group which attempts to improve human longevity through selective breeding.

Among Frank Herbert&#x27;s other works, the &quot;Dune&quot; series, starting with the eponymous 1965 novel, describes selective breeding by a powerful sisterhood, the &quot;Bene Gesserit&quot;, to produce a supernormal male being, the &quot;Kwisatz Haderach&quot;.

The Star Trek franchise features a race of genetically engineered humans which is known as &quot;Augments&quot;, the most notable of them is Khan Noonien Singh. These &quot;supermen&quot; were the cause of the Eugenics Wars, a dark period in Earth&#x27;s fictional history, before they were deposed and exiled. They appear in many of the franchise&#x27;s story arcs, most frequently, they appear as villains.

&lt;section begin=Gattaca1997/&gt;The film &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997) provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decide what people are capable of and their place in the world. The title alludes to the letters G, A, T and C, the four nucleobases of DNA, and depicts the possible consequences of genetic discrimination in the present societal framework. Relegated to the role of a cleaner owing to his genetically projected death at age 32 due to a heart condition (being told: &quot;The only way you&#x27;ll see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it&quot;), the protagonist observes enhanced astronauts as they are demonstrating their superhuman athleticism. Although it was not a box office success, it was critically acclaimed and influenced the debate over human genetic engineering in the public consciousness. As to its accuracy, its production company, Sony Pictures, consulted with a gene therapy researcher and prominent critic of eugenics known to have stated that &quot;[w]e should not step over the line that delineates treatment from enhancement&quot;, W. French Anderson, to ensure that the portrayal of science was realistic. Disputing their success in this mission, Philim Yam of &quot;Scientific American&quot; called the film &quot;science bashing&quot; and &quot;Nature&#x27;s&quot; Kevin Davies called it a &quot;surprisingly pedestrian affair&quot;, while molecular biologist Lee Silver described its extreme determinism as &quot;a straw man&quot;.

In his 2018 book &quot;Blueprint&quot;, the behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin writes that while &quot;Gattaca&quot; warned of the dangers of genetic information being used by a totalitarian state, genetic testing could also favor better meritocracy in democratic societies which already administer a variety of standardized tests to select people for education and employment. He suggests that polygenic scores might supplement testing in a manner that is essentially free of biases.

<text>Electronic mail (usually shortened to email; alternatively hyphenated e-mail) is a method of transmitting and receiving digital messages using electronic devices over a computer network. It was conceived in the late–20th century as the digital version of, or counterpart to, mail (hence &quot; + mail&quot;). Email is a ubiquitous and very widely used communication medium; in current use, an email address is often treated as a basic and necessary part of many processes in business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and other spheres of daily life in most countries.
Email operates across computer networks, primarily the Internet, and also local area networks. Today&#x27;s email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it.

Originally a text-only ASCII communications medium, Internet email was extended by MIME to carry text in expanded character sets and multimedia content such as images. International email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, is standardized but not widely adopted.
==Terminology==

The term &quot;electronic mail&quot; has been in use with its modern meaning since 1975, and variations of the shorter &quot;E-mail&quot; have been in use since 1979:

* email is now the common form, and recommended by style guides. It is the form required by IETF Requests for Comments (RFC) and working groups. This spelling also appears in most dictionaries.
* e-mail was originally the form favored in edited published American English and British English writing, and was formerly preferred by some style guides.
* E-mail is sometimes used. The original usage in June 1979 occurred in the journal &quot;Electronics&quot; in reference to the United States Postal Service initiative called E-COM, which was developed in the late 1970s and operated in the early 1980s.
* EMAIL was used by CompuServe starting in April 1981, which popularized the term.
* EMail is a traditional form used in RFCs for the &quot;Author&#x27;s Address&quot;.

The service is often simply referred to as &quot;mail&quot;, and a single piece of electronic mail is called a &quot;message&quot;. The conventions for fields within emails—the &quot;To&quot;, &quot;From&quot;, &quot;CC&quot;, &quot;BCC&quot; etc.—began with RFC-680 in 1975.

An Internet email consists of an &quot;envelope&quot; and &quot;content&quot;; the content consists of a &quot;header&quot; and a &quot;body&quot;.

== History ==
Computer-based messaging between users of the same system became possible after the advent of time-sharing in the early 1960s, with a notable implementation by MIT&#x27;s CTSS project in 1965. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. In 1971 the first ARPANET network mail was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the &#x27;@&#x27; symbol designating the user&#x27;s system address. Over a series of RFCs, conventions were refined for sending mail messages over the File Transfer Protocol.

Proprietary electronic mail systems soon began to emerge. IBM, CompuServe and Xerox used in-house mail systems in the 1970s; CompuServe sold a commercial intraoffice mail product in 1978 to IBM and to Xerox from 1981. DEC&#x27;s ALL-IN-1 and Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HPMAIL (later HP DeskManager) were released in 1982; development work on the former began in the late 1970s and the latter became the world&#x27;s largest selling email system.

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was implemented on the ARPANET in 1983. LAN email systems emerged in the mid-1980s. For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X.400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard (see Protocol Wars).

==Operation==
The following is a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent (MUA) addressed to the email address of the recipient.
# The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol, a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), to send the message content to the local mail submission agent (MSA), in this case &quot;smtp.a.org&quot;.
# The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header)—in this case, &quot;bob@b.org&quot;—which is a fully qualified domain address (FQDA). The part before the @ sign is the &quot;local part&quot; of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a domain name. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System (DNS).
# The DNS server for the domain &quot;b.org&quot; (&quot;ns.b.org&quot;) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case &quot;mx.b.org&quot;, a message transfer agent (MTA) server run by the recipient&#x27;s ISP.
# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent (MDA).
# The MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user &quot;bob&quot;.
# Bob&#x27;s MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol (POP3) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

In addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:
* Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product&#x27;s Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.
* Alice may not have an MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service.
* Alice&#x27;s computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1. 
* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.
* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.

Many MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called &quot;open mail relays&quot;. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable. However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare, and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.

Email pre-dates instant messaging, and transmission favors reliability over speed, in order to be able to cope with unreliable network links and busy servers (more common in the early days of the Internet). Reasons for slower delivery include:
* Messages going to a large number of recipients require more processing
* Large messages (e.g. with large attachments) require more time to transmit over the network
* Messages need to pass through multiple servers (sometimes multiple servers inside the same organization)
* One or more mail servers are overloaded (possibly due to spam or denial-of-service attack) and queuing incoming mail or temporarily refusing incoming connections
* SMTP requires multiple back-and-forths, which can amplify the impact of a slow network or dropped packets
* Sender or recipient temporarily disconnected from the network (e.g. a laptop out of wifi range)
* Slow DNS response
* Server down for maintenance or malfunction

Mail can be queued and retried for up to five days before senders are notified of a permanent delivery failure. Messages are timestamped as they pass through each server, allowing for diagnosis of slow delivery, though analysis is complicated by time zones and computer clocks that are inaccurately set.

Email messages classified as spam by a spam filter may be sorted into a separate folder which the recipient must check manually, or may be dropped entirely.

==Message format ==
The basic Internet message format used for email is defined by , with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called &quot;Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions&quot; or &quot;MIME&quot;. The extensions in International email apply only to email. RFC 5322 replaced RFC 2822 in 2008. Earlier, in 2001, RFC 2822 had in turn replaced RFC 822, which had been the standard for Internet email for decades. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET.

Internet email messages consist of two sections, &quot;header&quot; and &quot;body&quot;. These are known as &quot;content&quot;. The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a signature block at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.

===Message header===

RFC 5322 specifies the syntax of the email header. Each email message has a header (the &quot;header section&quot; of the message, according to the specification), comprising a number of fields (&quot;header fields&quot;). Each field has a name (&quot;field name&quot; or &quot;header field name&quot;), followed by the separator character &quot;:&quot;, and a value (&quot;field body&quot; or &quot;header field body&quot;).

Each field name begins in the first character of a new line in the header section, and begins with a non-whitespace printable character. It ends with the separator character &quot;:&quot;. The separator is followed by the field value (the &quot;field body&quot;). The value can continue onto subsequent lines if those lines have space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without SMTPUTF8, field bodies are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words.

====Header fields====
Email header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the limit is 998 characters. Header fields defined by RFC 5322 contain only US-ASCII characters; for encoding characters in other sets, a syntax specified in RFC 2047 may be used. In some examples, the IETF EAI working group defines some standards track extensions, replacing previous experimental extensions so UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters may be used within the header. In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products, and promoted by some government agents.

The message header must include at least the following fields:
* &quot;From&quot;: The email address, and, optionally, the name of the author(s). Some email clients are changeable through account settings.
* &quot;Date&quot;: The local time and date the message was written. Like the &quot;From:&quot; field, many email clients fill this in automatically before sending. The recipient&#x27;s client may display the time in the format and time zone local to them.

RFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA; it provides for permanent and provisional field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:

* &quot;To&quot;: The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message&#x27;s recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.
* &quot;Subject&quot;: A brief summary of the topic of the message. Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject, including &quot;RE:&quot; and &quot;FW:&quot;.
* &quot;Cc&quot;: Carbon copy; Many email clients mark email in one&#x27;s inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list.
* &quot;Bcc&quot;: Blind carbon copy; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.
* Content-Type: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a MIME type.
* &quot;Precedence&quot;: commonly with values &quot;bulk&quot;, &quot;junk&quot;, or &quot;list&quot;; used to indicate automated &quot;vacation&quot; or &quot;out of office&quot; responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with &quot;Precedence: special-delivery&quot; messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it was. Microsoft Exchange respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the &quot;X-Auto-Response-Suppress&quot; field.
* &quot;Message-ID&quot;: Also an automatic-generated field to prevent multiple deliveries and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).
* &quot;In-Reply-To&quot;: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies to reply messages.
* &quot;List-Unsubscribe&quot;: HTTP link to unsubscribe from a mailing list.
* &quot;References&quot;: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.
* &quot;&quot;: Address should be used to reply to the message.
* &quot;Sender&quot;: Address of the sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).
* &quot;Archived-At&quot;: A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.

The &quot;To:&quot; field may be unrelated to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, SMTP, which may be extracted from the header content. The &quot;To:&quot; field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the &quot;From:&quot; field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages relayed. Data pertaining to the server&#x27;s activity is also part of the header, as defined below.

SMTP defines the &quot;trace information&quot; of a message saved in the header using the following two fields:
* &quot;Received&quot;: after an SMTP server accepts a message, it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).
* &quot;Return-Path&quot;: after the delivery SMTP server makes the &quot;final delivery&quot; of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.

Other fields added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called &quot;trace fields&quot;.
* &quot;Authentication-Results&quot;: after a server verifies authentication, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.
* &quot;Received-SPF&quot;: stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.

===Message body===

====Content encoding====
Internet email was designed for 7-bit ASCII. Most email software is 8-bit clean, but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: quoted printable for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data. The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many mail transport agents may not support them. In some countries, e-mail software violates by sending raw non-ASCII text and several encoding schemes co-exist; as a result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international character sets, Unicode is growing in popularity.

====Plain text and HTML====
Most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user. HTML email messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility.

Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in block quotes, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as underlines and italics, and change font styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about web bugs, abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software.
Some e-mail clients interpret the body as HTML even in the absence of a codice_1 header field; this may cause various problems.

Some web-based mailing lists recommend all posts be made in plain text, with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons, and because they have a significant number of readers using text-based email clients such as Mutt.
Various informal conventions evolved for marking up plain text in email and usenet posts, which later led to the development of formal languages like setext &quot;(c. 1992)&quot; and many others, the most popular of them being markdown.

Some Microsoft email clients may allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format (RTF), but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client.

==Servers and client applications==
Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it, and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender, indicating the problem.

Users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP, or, as is more likely in a large corporate environment, with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise, Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers. Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called mail user agents (MUAs).

When opening an email, it is marked as &quot;read&quot;, which typically visibly distinguishes it from &quot;unread&quot; messages on clients&#x27; user interfaces. Email clients may allow hiding read emails from the inbox so the user can focus on the unread.

Mail can be stored on the client, on the server side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP, moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol.

Many current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, that performs the same tasks. Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser, from any computer, rather than relying on a local email client.

===Filename extensions===
Upon reception of email messages, email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the &quot;mbox&quot; format. The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions:
;codice_2
:Used by many email clients including Novell GroupWise, Microsoft Outlook Express, Lotus notes, Windows Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.
;codice_3
:Used by Apple Mail.
;codice_4
:Used by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware.
;codice_5
:Used by Opera Mail, KMail, and Apple Mail based on the mbox format.

Some applications (like Apple Mail) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.

===URI scheme mailto===

The URI scheme, as registered with the IANA, defines the codice_6 scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user&#x27;s mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the &quot;To:&quot; field. Many clients also support query string parameters for the other email fields, such as its subject line or carbon copy recipients.

==Types==

===Web-based email===

Many email providers have a web-based email client. This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the web client, so it cannot be read without a current Internet connection.

===POP3 email servers===
The Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the server. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC&#x27;s). POP3 allows downloading messages on a local computer and reading them even when offline.

===IMAP email servers===
The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while traveling and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually, the mail is left in folders in the mail server.

===MAPI email servers===
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server—and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server, Kerio Connect, Scalix, Zimbra, HP OpenMail, IBM Lotus Notes, Zarafa, and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.

==Uses==
===Business and organizational use===
Email has been widely accepted by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an &#x27;e-revolution&#x27; in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.

It has some key benefits to business and other organizations, including:
; Facilitating logistics
: Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, telephone call, or conference call can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.
; Helping with synchronization
: With real time communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows : each participant may control their schedule independently. Batch processing of incoming emails can improve workflow compared to interrupting calls.
; Reducing cost
: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or long distance telephone calls, telex or telegrams.
; Increasing speed
: Much faster than most of the alternatives.
; Creating a &quot;written&quot; record
: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.
; Possibility of auto-processing and improved distribution
: As well pre-processing of customer&#x27;s orders or addressing the person in charge can be realized by automated procedures.

====Email marketing====
Email marketing via &quot;opt-in&quot; is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information. Depending on the recipient&#x27;s culture, email sent without permission—such as an &quot;opt-in&quot;—is likely to be viewed as unwelcome &quot;email spam&quot;.

===Personal use===

====Personal computer====
Many users access their personal emails from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment.

====Mobile====
Email has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers. Mobile &quot;apps&quot; for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their homes. While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other devices to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. , there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.

Individuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone. It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on a smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.

====Declining use among young people====
, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media. Technology writer Matt Richtel said in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that email was like the VCR, vinyl records and film cameras—no longer cool and something older people do.

A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.

==Issues==
===Attachment size limitation===

Email messages may have one or more attachments, which are additional files that are appended to the email. Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents, PDF documents, and scanned images of paper documents. In principle, there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments. However, in practice, email clients, servers, and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email – typically to 25MB or less. Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ from what the user sees, which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email. Where larger files need to be shared, various file hosting services are available and commonly used.

===Information overload===
The ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and &quot;white collar&quot; employees has led to concerns that recipients face an &quot;information overload&quot; in dealing with increasing volumes of email. With the growth in mobile devices, by default employees may also receive work-related emails outside of their working day. This can lead to increased stress and decreased satisfaction with work. Some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect, as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity.

===Spam===

Email &quot;spam&quot; is unsolicited bulk email. The low cost of sending such email meant that, by 2003, up to 30% of total email traffic was spam, and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool. The US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact, and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users, but the volume sent is still very high—and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links. In September 2017, for example, the proportion of spam to legitimate email rose to 59.56%. The percentage of spam email in 2021 is estimated to be 85%.

===Malware===
Emails are a major vector for the distribution of malware. This is often achieved by attaching malicious programs to the message and persuading potential victims to open the file. Types of malware distributed via email include computer worms and ransomware.

===Email spoofing===

Email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.

===Email bombing===
Email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.

===Privacy concerns===
Today it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender&#x27;s or the recipient&#x27;s control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.

Email privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:
* email messages are generally not encrypted.
* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.
* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.
* the &quot;Received:&quot;-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.
* web bugs invisibly embedded in HTML content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is rendered as HTML (some e-mail clients do this when the user reads, or re-reads the e-mail) and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the user agent string.

There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP, SMEmail, or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.

Additionally, many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer-to-peer filesharing. Attached files may contain trojans or viruses.

===Legal contracts===
It is possible for an exchange of emails to form a binding contract, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence. A signature block on an email may be interpreted as satisfying a signature requirement for a contract.

===Flaming===
Flaming occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word &quot;incendiary&quot; to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.

===Email bankruptcy===

Also known as &quot;email fatigue&quot;, email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a &quot;boilerplate&quot; message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.

===Internationalization===
Originally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based. MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets, but other headers and email addresses using UTF-8, while standardized have yet to be widely adopted.
===Tracking of sent mail===
The original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications (delivery receipts) and Message Disposition Notifications (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production.

Many ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:
* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.
* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address (email spoofing), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam (backscatter) from the ISP to the innocent user.

In the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns, and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML. Many mail clients now default to not showing &quot;web content&quot;. Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images.

<doc id="9739" wikidata="Q31963" url="?curid=9739" title="Emoticon">
<text>An emoticon (, , rarely , ), short for emotion icon, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers and letters—to express a person&#x27;s feelings, mood or reaction, without needing to describe it in detail.

The first ASCII emoticons are generally credited to computer scientist Scott Fahlman, who proposed what came to be known as &quot;smileys&quot;—codice_1 and —in a message on the bulletin board system (BBS) of Carnegie Mellon University in 1982. In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called &quot;kaomoji&quot;, using Japanese&#x27;s larger character sets. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986. They are also known as &quot;verticons&quot; (from &quot;vertical emoticon&quot;) due to their readability without rotations.

As SMS mobile text messaging and the Internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used in texting, Internet forums and emails. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of &quot;tone&quot; through texting through facial gestures. Emoticons were the precursors to modern emojis.

==History==
===Different uses of text characters (pre-1981)===
In 1648, poet Robert Herrick wrote, &quot;Tumble me down, and I will sit Upon my ruins, (smiling yet:).&quot; Herrick&#x27;s work predated any other recorded use of brackets as a smiling face by around 200 years. However, experts doubted the inclusion of the colon in the poem was deliberate and if it was meant to represent a smiling face. English professor Alan Jacobs argued that &quot;punctuation, in general, was unsettled in the seventeenth century ... Herrick was unlikely to have consistent punctuational practices himself, and even if he did he couldn&#x27;t expect either his printers or his readers to share them.&quot; 17th century typography practice often placed colons and semicolons within parentheses, including 14 instances of &quot;&quot; in Richard Baxter&#x27;s 1653 &quot;Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church-membership and Baptism&quot;.

Precursors to modern emoticons have existed since the 19th century. The &quot;National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide&quot; in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in Morse code to express &quot;love and kisses&quot; (later reduced to the more formal &quot;best regards&quot;). &quot;Dodge&#x27;s Manual&quot; in 1908 documented the reintroduction of &quot;love and kisses&quot; as the number 88. New Zealand academics Joan Gajadhar and John Green comment that both Morse code abbreviations are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as LOL.
The transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s speeches in 1862 recorded the audience&#x27;s reaction as: &quot;(applause and laughter ;)&quot;. There has been some debate whether the glyph in Lincoln&#x27;s speech was a typo, a legitimate punctuation construct or the first emoticon. Linguist Philip Seargeant argues that it was a simple typesetting error.

Before March 1881, the examples of &quot;typographical art&quot; appeared in at least three newspaper articles, including &quot;Kurjer warszawski&quot; (published in Warsaw) from March 5, 1881, using punctuation to represent the emotions of joy, melancholy, indifference and astonishment.
In a 1912 essay titled &quot;For Brevity and Clarity&quot;, American author Ambrose Bierce suggested facetiously that a bracket could be used to represent a smiling face, proposing &quot;an improvement in punctuation&quot; with which writers could convey &quot;&quot;, loud or immoderate laughter: &quot;it is written thus ‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence&quot;. In a 1936 &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; article, writer Alan Gregg proposed combining brackets with various other punctuation marks to represent various moods. Brackets were used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks, with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions: for a smile, (showing more &quot;teeth&quot;) for laughter, for a frown and for a wink. An instance of text characters representing a sideways smiling and frowning face could be found in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; on March 10, 1953, promoting the film &quot;Lili&quot; starring Leslie Caron.

The September 1962 issue of &quot;MAD&quot; magazine included an article titled &quot;Typewri-toons&quot;. The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to &quot;Royal Portable&quot;, was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger &#x27;bust&#x27; than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n&#x27;s interrupted by a lowercase h &quot;raising its hand&quot;. A further example attributed to a &quot;Baltimore Sunday Sun&quot; columnist appeared in a 1967 article in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, using a dash and right bracket to represent a tongue in one&#x27;s cheek: ). Prefiguring the modern &quot;smiley&quot; emoticon, writer Vladimir Nabokov told an interviewer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1969, &quot;I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile—some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.&quot;

In the 1970s, the PLATO IV computer system was launched. It was one of the first computers used throughout educational and professional institutions, but rarely used in a residential setting. On the computer system, a student at the University of Illinois developed pictograms that resembled different smiling faces. Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope stated this likely took place in 1972, and they claimed these to be the first emoticons.

===ASCII emoticons use in digital communication (1982–mid-1990s)===
Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Scott Fahlman is generally credited with the invention of the digital text-based emoticon in 1982. The use of ASCII symbols, a standard set of codes representing typographical marks, was essential to allow the symbols to be displayed on any computer. In Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s bulletin board system, Fahlman proposed colon–hyphen–right bracket as a label for &quot;attempted humor&quot; to try to solve the difficulty of conveying humor or sarcasm in plain text. Fahlman sent the following message after an incident where a humorous warning about a mercury spill in an elevator was misunderstood as serious:


Within a few months, the smiley had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet. Other suggestions on the forum included an asterisk and an ampersand , the latter meant to represent a person doubled over in laughter, as well as a percent sign and a pound sign . Scott Fahlman suggested that not only could his emoticon communicate emotion, but also replace language. Since the 1990s, emoticons (colon, hyphen and bracket) have become integral to digital communications, and have inspired a variety of other emoticons, including the &quot;winking&quot; face using a semicolon , , a representation of the Face with Tears of Joy emoji and the acronym LOL.

In 1996, The Smiley Company was established by Nicolas Loufrani and his father Franklin as a way of commercializing the smiley trademark. As part of this, The Smiley Dictionary website focused on ASCII emoticons, where a catalogue was made of them. Many other people did similar to Loufrani from 1995 onwards, including David Sanderson creating the book &quot;Smileys&quot; in 1997. James Marshall also hosted an online collection of ASCII emoticons that he completed in 2008.

A researcher at Stanford University surveyed the emoticons used in four million Twitter messages and found that the smiling emoticon without a hyphen &quot;nose&quot; was much more common than the original version with the hyphen . Linguist Vyvyan Evans argues that this represents a shift in usage by younger users as a form of &quot;covert prestige&quot;: rejecting a standard usage in order to demonstrate in-group membership.

===Graphical emoticons and other developments (1990s–present)===
Loufrani began to use the basic text designs and turned them into graphical representations. They are now known as graphical emoticons. His designs were registered at the United States Copyright Office in 1997 and appeared online as GIF files in 1998. For ASCII emoticons that did not exist to convert into graphical form, Loufrani also backward engineered new ASCII emoticons from the graphical versions he created. These were the first graphical representations of ASCII emoticons. He published his Smiley icons as well as emoticons created by others, along with their ASCII versions, in an online Smiley Dictionary in 2001. This dictionary included 640 different smiley icons and was published as a book called &quot;Dico Smileys&quot; in 2002. In 2017, British magazine &quot;The Drum&quot; referred to Loufrani as the &quot;godfather of the emoji&quot; for his work in the field.

On September 23, 2021, it was announced that Scott Fahlman was holding an auction for the original emoticons he created in 1982. The auction was held in Dallas, United States, and sold the two designs as non-fungible tokens (NFT). The online auction ended later that month, with the originals selling for US$237,500.

In some programming languages, certain operators are known informally by their emoticon-like appearance. This includes the Spaceship operator codice_2 (a comparison), the Diamond operator codice_3 (for type hinting) and the Elvis operator codice_4 (a shortened ternary operator).

==Styles==
===Western===
Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by the nose and the mouth. It is commonly placed at the end of a sentence, replacing the full stop. The two-character version codice_5, which omits the nose, is very popular. The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but some can be rotated (making them tiny ambigrams). There are also some variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express another feeling. For example, equals sad and equals very sad. Weeping can be written as codice_6. A blush can be expressed as codice_7. Others include wink codice_8, a grin codice_9, codice_10 for tongue out, and smug ; they can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it. codice_11, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also codice_12 for a heart and codice_13 for a broken heart. codice_14 is also sometimes used to depict shock. codice_15 is used to depict melancholy, disappointment or disapproval. codice_16 may be used to depict a neutral face.

A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; codice_17 and the addition of further &quot;D&quot; letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement, e.g., codice_18. The &quot;3&quot; in codice_19 and codice_20 represents an animal&#x27;s mouth. An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as codice_21. It has become more acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user&#x27;s age, with younger people less likely to use a nose.

Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley codice_21 may occur in Scandinavia. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters codice_23 and codice_24 can be seen as emoticons, as the upright versions of codice_14 (meaning that one is surprised) and codice_9 (meaning that one is very happy), respectively. In countries where the Cyrillic alphabet is used, the right parenthesis codice_27 is used as a smiley. Multiple parentheses codice_28 are used to express greater happiness, amusement or laughter. The colon is omitted due to being in a lesser-known position on the ЙЦУКЕН keyboard layout. The &#x27;shrug&#x27; emoticon, uses the glyph ツ from the Japanese katakana writing system.

===Kaomoji (Japan ASCII movement)===
Kaomoji are often seen as the Japanese development of emoticons that is separate to the Scott Fahlman movement, which started in 1982. In 1986, a designer began to use brackets and other ASCII text characters to form faces. Over time, they became more often differentiated from each other, although both use ASCII characters. However, more westernised Kaomojis have dropped the brackets, such as codice_29, codice_30 and codice_31, popularised in internet subcultures such as the anime and furry communities.

===2channel===

Users of the Japanese discussion board 2channel, in particular, have developed a variety emoticons using characters from various scripts, such as Kannada, as in codice_32 (for a look of disapproval, disbelief or confusion). Similarly, the letter ರೃ was used in emoticons to represent a monocle and ಥ to represent a tearing eye. They were picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after. Some have become characters in their own right like Monā.

===Korean===
In South Korea, emoticons use Korean Hangul letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean jamo (letters) instead of other characters.

The consonant jamos codice_33, codice_34 or codice_35 can be used as the mouth or nose component and codice_36, codice_37 or codice_38 for the eyes. Using quotation marks codice_39 and apostrophes codice_40 are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ and ㅠ can depict a crying face. Example: (same function as T in Western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash &quot;—&quot;, but a vowel jamo), a comma (codice_41) or an underscore (codice_42) is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in and Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons can mean sweating, examples of it are codice_43, and .

===Chinese ideographic===
The character 囧 (U+56E7), which means , may be combined with the posture emoticon Orz, such as The character existed in Oracle bone script but was rarely used until its use as an emoticon, documented as early as January 20, 2005.

Other variants of 囧 include 崮 (king 囧), 莔 (queen 囧), 商 (囧 with a hat), 囧興 (turtle) and 卣 (&quot;Bomberman&quot;). The character 槑 (U+69D1), a variant of 梅 , is used to represent a double of 呆 or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) might be duplicated to express emphasis.

==Posture emoticons==
===Orz===

 (other forms include: , , , , , , , and ) is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person (the Japanese version of which is called &quot;dogeza&quot;), with the &quot;o&quot; being the head, the &quot;r&quot; being the arms and part of the body, and the &quot;z&quot; being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure can represent respect or &quot;kowtowing&quot;, but commonly appears along a range of responses, including &quot;frustration, despair, sarcasm, or grudging respect&quot;.

It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, a Japanese personal website. At the &quot;Techside FAQ Forum&quot; (), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing &quot;&quot; to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the concept of nice guys.

=== o7 ===
o7, or O7, is an emoticon that depicts a person saluting, with the &quot;o&quot; being the head and the &quot;7&quot; being its arm.

==Multimedia variations==
A portmanteau of &quot;emotion&quot; and &quot;sound&quot;, an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or email message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext. Some services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and music players in an Adobe Flash-based widget. In 2004, the Trillian chat application introduced a feature called &quot;emotiblips&quot;, which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients &quot;as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon&quot;.

In 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the &quot;emoticlip&quot; as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show &quot;The Hills&quot;. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley &amp; Montgomery advertising firm, which wrote that they hoped it would be widely adopted as &quot;greeting cards that just happen to be selling something&quot;.

==Intellectual property rights==
In 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the &quot;frowny&quot; emoticon when used on &quot;greeting cards, posters and art prints&quot;. In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the company received protests when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot.

A number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have been issued as US patents. US 6987991, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu. The stated advantage was that it eases entering emoticons.

The emoticon codice_1 was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM). In Finland, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked, thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons codice_1, codice_21, codice_47, codice_5 and In 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against Siemens by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the codice_49 emoticon. In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the codice_49 emoticon. A license would not &quot;cost that much—tens of thousands of dollars&quot; for companies but would be free of charge for individuals.

==Unicode==
A different, but related, use of the term &quot;emoticon&quot; is found in the Unicode Standard, referring to a subset of emoji that display facial expressions. The standard explains this usage with reference to existing systems, which provided functionality for substituting certain textual emoticons with images or emoji of the expressions in question.

Some smiley faces were present in Unicode since 1.1, including a white frowning face, a white smiling face and a black smiling face (&quot;black&quot; refers to a glyph which is filled, &quot;white&quot; refers to a glyph which is unfilled).

The Emoticons block was introduced in Unicode Standard version 6.0 (published in October 2010) and extended by 7.0. It covers Unicode range from U+1F600 to U+1F64F fully.
After that block had been filled, Unicode 8.0 (2015), 9.0 (2016) and 10.0 (2017) added additional emoticons in the range from U+1F910 to U+1F9FF. Currently, U+1F90CU+1F90F, U+1F93F, U+1F94DU+1F94F, U+1F96CU+1F97F, U+1F998U+1F9CF (excluding U+1F9C0 which contains the 🧀 emoji) and U+1F9E7U+1F9FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode 10.0.

For historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities, and professions instead of emotions, are also found in Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (especially U+1F466U+1F487) and Transport and Map Symbols. Body parts, mostly hands, are also encoded in the Dingbat and Miscellaneous Symbols blocks.

<text>The Erdős number () describes the &quot;collaborative distance&quot; between mathematician Paul Erdős and another person, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. The same principle has been applied in other fields where a particular individual has collaborated with a large and broad number of peers.

== Overview ==

Paul Erdős (1913–1996) was an influential Hungarian mathematician who in the latter part of his life spent a great deal of time writing papers with a large number of colleagues—over 500—working on solutions to outstanding mathematical problems. He published more papers during his lifetime (at least 1,525) than any other mathematician in history. (Leonhard Euler published more total pages of mathematics but fewer separate papers: about 800.) Erdős spent most of his career with no permanent home or job. He traveled with everything he owned in two suitcases, and would visit mathematicians he wanted to collaborate with, often unexpectedly, and expect to stay with them.

The idea of the Erdős number was originally created by the mathematician&#x27;s friends as a tribute to his enormous output. Later it gained prominence as a tool to study how mathematicians cooperate to find answers to unsolved problems. Several projects are devoted to studying connectivity among researchers, using the Erdős number as a proxy. For example, Erdős collaboration graphs can tell us how authors cluster, how the number of co-authors per paper evolves over time, or how new theories propagate.

Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erdős numbers (i.e. high proximity). The median Erdős number of Fields Medalists is 3. Only 7,097 (about 5% of mathematicians with a collaboration path) have an Erdős number of 2 or lower. As time passes, the lowest Erdős number that can still be achieved will necessarily increase, as mathematicians with low Erdős numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. Still, historical figures can have low Erdős numbers. For example, renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan has an Erdős number of only 3 (through G. H. Hardy, Erdős number 2), even though Paul Erdős was only 7 years old when Ramanujan died.

==Definition and application in mathematics==
To be assigned an Erdős number, someone must be a coauthor of a research paper with another person who has a finite Erdős number. Paul Erdős himself is assigned an Erdős number of zero. A certain author&#x27;s Erdős number is one greater than the lowest Erdős number of any of their collaborators; for example, an author who has coauthored a publication with Erdős would have an Erdős number of 1. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the collaboration distance between two mathematical authors listed in the &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot; catalogue.

Erdős wrote around 1,500 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly co-written. He had 509 direct collaborators; these are the people with Erdős number 1. The people who have collaborated with them (but not with Erdős himself) have an Erdős number of 2 (12,600 people as of 7 August 2020), those who have collaborated with people who have an Erdős number of 2 (but not with Erdős or anyone with an Erdős number of 1) have an Erdős number of 3, and so forth. A person with no such coauthorship chain connecting to Erdős has an Erdős number of infinity (or an undefined one). Since the death of Paul Erdős, the lowest Erdős number that a new researcher can obtain is 2.

There is room for ambiguity over what constitutes a link between two authors. The American Mathematical Society collaboration distance calculator uses data from &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot;, which includes most mathematics journals but covers other subjects only in a limited way, and which also includes some non-research publications. The Erdős Number Project web site says: It also says:
but excludes non-research publications such as elementary textbooks, joint editorships, obituaries, and the like. The &quot;Erdős number of the second kind&quot; restricts assignment of Erdős numbers to papers with only two collaborators.

The Erdős number was most likely first defined in print by Casper Goffman, an analyst whose own Erdős number is 2. Goffman published his observations about Erdős&#x27; prolific collaboration in a 1969 article entitled &quot;And what is your Erdős number?&quot; See also some comments in an obituary by Michael Golomb.

The median Erdős number among Fields medalists is as low as 3. Fields medalists with Erdős number 2 include Atle Selberg, Kunihiko Kodaira, Klaus Roth, Alan Baker, Enrico Bombieri, David Mumford, Charles Fefferman, William Thurston, Shing-Tung Yau, Jean Bourgain, Richard Borcherds, Manjul Bhargava, Jean-Pierre Serre and Terence Tao. There are no Fields medalists with Erdős number 1; however, Endre Szemerédi is an Abel Prize Laureate with Erdős number 1.

==Most frequent Erdős collaborators==
While Erdős collaborated with hundreds of co-authors, there were some individuals with whom he co-authored dozens of papers. This is a list of the ten persons who most frequently co-authored with Erdős and their number of papers co-authored with Erdős (i.e. their number of collaborations).
==Related fields==
, all Fields Medalists have a finite Erdős number, with values that range between 2 and 6, and a median of 3. In contrast, the median Erdős number across all mathematicians (with a finite Erdős number) is 5, with an extreme value of 13. The table below summarizes the Erdős number statistics for Nobel prize laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, and Economics. The first column counts the number of laureates. The second column counts the number of winners with a finite Erdős number. The third column is the percentage of winners with a finite Erdős number. The remaining columns report the minimum, maximum, average, and median Erdős numbers among those laureates.

===Physics===
Among the Nobel Prize laureates in Physics, Albert Einstein and Sheldon Glashow have an Erdős number of 2. Nobel Laureates with an Erdős number of 3 include Enrico Fermi, Otto Stern, Wolfgang Pauli, Max Born, Willis E. Lamb, Eugene Wigner, Richard P. Feynman, Hans A. Bethe, Murray Gell-Mann, Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg, Norman F. Ramsey, Frank Wilczek, David Wineland, and Giorgio Parisi. Fields Medal-winning physicist Ed Witten has an Erdős number of 3.

===Biology===
Computational biologist Lior Pachter has an Erdős number of 2. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski has an Erdős number of 3, having co-authored a publication with Lior Pachter and with mathematician Bernd Sturmfels, each of whom has an Erdős number of 2.

===Finance and economics===
There are at least two winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics with an Erdős number of 2: Harry M. Markowitz (1990) and Leonid Kantorovich (1975). Other financial mathematicians with Erdős number of 2 include David Donoho, Marc Yor, Henry McKean, Daniel Stroock, and Joseph Keller.

Nobel Prize laureates in Economics with an Erdős number of 3 include Kenneth J. Arrow (1972), Milton Friedman (1976), Herbert A. Simon (1978), Gerard Debreu (1983), John Forbes Nash, Jr. (1994), James Mirrlees (1996), Daniel McFadden (2000), Daniel Kahneman (2002), Robert J. Aumann (2005), Leonid Hurwicz (2007), Roger Myerson (2007), Alvin E. Roth (2012), and Lloyd S. Shapley (2012) and Jean Tirole (2014).

Some investment firms have been founded by mathematicians with low Erdős numbers, among them James B. Ax of Axcom Technologies, and James H. Simons of Renaissance Technologies, both with an Erdős number of 3.

===Philosophy===
Since the more formal versions of philosophy share reasoning with the basics of mathematics, these fields overlap considerably, and Erdős numbers are available for many philosophers. Philosophers John P. Burgess and Brian Skyrms have an Erdős number of 2. Jon Barwise and Joel David Hamkins, both with Erdős number 2, have also contributed extensively to philosophy, but are primarily described as mathematicians.

===Law===
Judge Richard Posner, having coauthored with Alvin E. Roth, has an Erdős number of at most 4. Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a politician, philosopher, and legal theorist who teaches at Harvard Law School, has an Erdős number of at most 4, having coauthored with Lee Smolin.

===Politics===
Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021, has an Erdős number of at most 5.

===Engineering===
Some fields of engineering, in particular communication theory and cryptography, make direct use of the discrete mathematics championed by Erdős. It is therefore not surprising that practitioners in these fields have low Erdős numbers. For example, Robert McEliece, a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech, had an Erdős number of 1, having collaborated with Erdős himself. Cryptographers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, inventors of the RSA cryptosystem, all have Erdős number 2.

===Linguistics===
The Romanian mathematician and computational linguist Solomon Marcus had an Erdős number of 1 for a paper in &quot;Acta Mathematica Hungarica&quot; that he co-authored with Erdős in 1957.

==Impact==

Erdős numbers have been a part of the folklore of mathematicians throughout the world for many years. Among all working mathematicians at the turn of the millennium who have a finite Erdős number, the numbers range up to 15, the median is 5, and the mean is 4.65; almost everyone with a finite Erdős number has a number less than 8. Due to the very high frequency of interdisciplinary collaboration in science today, very large numbers of non-mathematicians in many other fields of science also have finite Erdős numbers. For example, political scientist Steven Brams has an Erdős number of 2. In biomedical research, it is common for statisticians to be among the authors of publications, and many statisticians can be linked to Erdős via John Tukey, who has an Erdős number of 2. Similarly, the prominent geneticist Eric Lander and the mathematician Daniel Kleitman have collaborated on papers, and since Kleitman has an Erdős number of 1, a large fraction of the genetics and genomics community can be linked via Lander and his numerous collaborators. Similarly, collaboration with Gustavus Simmons opened the door for 
Erdős numbers within the cryptographic research community, and many linguists have finite Erdős numbers, many due to chains of collaboration with such notable scholars as Noam Chomsky (Erdős number 4), William Labov (3), Mark Liberman (3), Geoffrey Pullum (3), or Ivan Sag (4). There are also connections with arts fields.

According to Alex Lopez-Ortiz, all the Fields and Nevanlinna prize winners during the three cycles in 1986 to 1994 have Erdős numbers of at most 9.

Earlier mathematicians published fewer papers than modern ones, and more rarely published jointly written papers. The earliest person known to have a finite Erdős number is either Antoine Lavoisier (born 1743, Erdős number 13), Richard Dedekind (born 1831, Erdős number 7), or Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (born 1849, Erdős number 3), depending on the standard of publication eligibility.

Martin Tompa proposed a directed graph version of the Erdős number problem, by orienting edges of the collaboration graph from the alphabetically earlier author to the alphabetically later author and defining the &quot;monotone Erdős number&quot; of an author to be the length of a longest path from Erdős to the author in this directed graph. He finds a path of this type of length 12.

Also, Michael Barr suggests &quot;rational Erdős numbers&quot;, generalizing the idea that a person who has written &quot;p&quot; joint papers with Erdős should be assigned Erdős number 1/&quot;p&quot;. From the collaboration multigraph of the second kind (although he also has a way to deal with the case of the first kind)—with one edge between two mathematicians for &quot;each&quot; joint paper they have produced—form an electrical network with a one-ohm resistor on each edge. The total resistance between two nodes tells how &quot;close&quot; these two nodes are.

It has been argued that &quot;for an individual researcher, a measure such as Erdős number captures the structural properties of [the] network whereas the &quot;h&quot;-index captures the citation impact of the publications,&quot; and that &quot;One can be easily convinced that ranking in coauthorship networks should take into account both measures to generate a realistic and acceptable ranking.&quot;

In 2004 William Tozier, a mathematician with an Erdős number of 4 auctioned off a co-authorship on eBay, hence providing the buyer with an Erdős number of 5. The winning bid of $1031 was posted by a Spanish mathematician, who refused to pay and only placed the bid to stop what he considered a mockery.

==Variations==
A number of variations on the concept have been proposed to apply to other fields, notably the Bacon number (as in the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon), connecting actors to the actor Kevin Bacon by a chain of joint appearances in films. It was created in 1994, 25 years after Goffman&#x27;s article on the Erdős number.

A small number of people are connected to both Erdős and Bacon and thus have an Erdős–Bacon number, which combines the two numbers by taking their sum. One example is the actress-mathematician Danica McKellar, best known for playing Winnie Cooper on the TV series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. 
Her Erdős number is 4, and her Bacon number is 2.

Further extension is possible. For example, the &quot;Erdős–Bacon–Sabbath number&quot; is the sum of the Erdős–Bacon number and the collaborative distance to the band Black Sabbath in terms of singing in public. Physicist Stephen Hawking had an Erdős–Bacon–Sabbath number of 8, and actress Natalie Portman has one of 11 (her Erdős number is 5).

In chess, the Morphy number describes a player&#x27;s connection to Paul Morphy, widely considered the greatest chess player of his time and an unofficial World Chess Champion.

In go, the Shusaku number describes a player&#x27;s connection to Honinbo Shusaku, the strongest player of his time.

In video games, the Ryu number describes a video game character&#x27;s connection to the Street Fighter character Ryu.

<text>A school voucher, also called an education voucher in a voucher system, is a certificate of government funding for students at schools chosen by themselves or their parents. Funding is usually for a particular year, term, or semester. In some countries, states, or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse home schooling expenses. In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.

A 2017 review of the economics literature on school vouchers concluded that &quot;the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis; however, multiple positive findings support continued exploration&quot;.

==History==
When France lost the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) many blamed the loss on its inferior military education system. Following this defeat, the French Assembly proposed a voucher that they hoped would improve schools by allowing students to seek out the best. This proposal never moved forward due to the reluctance of the French to subsidize religious education. Despite its failure, this proposal closely resembles voucher systems proposed and used today in many countries.

The oldest extant school voucher programs in the United States are the Town Tuitioning programs in Vermont and Maine, beginning in 1869 and 1873 respectively. Because some towns in these states operate neither local high schools nor elementary schools, students in these towns &quot;are eligible for a voucher to attend [either] public schools in other towns or non-religious private schools. In these cases, the &#x27;sending&#x27; towns pay tuition directly to the &#x27;receiving&#x27; schools&quot;.

A system of educational vouchers was introduced in the Netherlands in 1917. Today, more than 70% of pupils attend privately run but publicly funded schools, mostly split along denominational lines.

Milton Friedman argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the 1950s, stating that competition would improve schools, cost less and yield superior educational outcomes. Friedman&#x27;s reasoning in favor of vouchers gained additional attention in 1980 with the broadcast of his ten-part television series &quot;Free to Choose&quot; and the publication of its companion book of the same name (co-written with his wife Rose Friedman, who was also an economist). Episode 6 of the series and chapter 6 of the book were both entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Our Schools&quot;, and asserted that permitting parents and students to use vouchers to choose their schools would expand freedom of choice and produce more well-educated students.

In some Southern states during the 1960s, school vouchers were used as a way to perpetuate segregation. In a few instances, public schools were closed outright and vouchers were issued to parents. The vouchers, known as tuition grants, in many cases, were only good at new, private and segregated schools, known as segregation academies.

==Definitions==
There are distinctions between different kinds of schools:
* Charter schools are funded publicly
* Education savings accounts (ESAs) allow parents to withdraw their children from public district or charter schools and receive a deposit of public funds into government-authorized savings accounts with restricted, but multiple, uses. Those funds, often distributed to families via debit card, can cover private school tuition and fees, online learning programs, private tutoring, community college costs, higher education expenses and other approved customized learning services and materials.
* Education tax credit, tuition tax credit, or tax-credit scholarship: There are two types of education tax credits: personal use, and donation. Personal use tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers for education expenditures made on behalf of their own children. Donation tax credits are tax credits given to individual taxpayers or businesses who donate to non-profit organizations that give out private school scholarships.
* Open enrollment is a system that allows parents to choose which public school their child attends instead of being assigned one, provided the school has not reached its maximum capacity number for students. The term &quot;open enrollment&quot; refers exclusively to the ability to choose between schools all of which are public schools. Open enrollment can be intradistrict (where the choice is between schools all of which are in the one public school district where the student&#x27;s family lives) or interdistrict (where the student may choose a public school in which he or she is non-resident). As of 2023, 27 states have state policies permitting intradistrict open enrollment while 43 states have state policies permitting interdistrict open enrollment.
* Private schools are funded privately, such as by tuition or donations.
* Public schools are funded by taxes (except in the United Kingdom, where the term &#x27;public school&#x27; refers to older private schools, and the equivalent term for tax-funded schools is &#x27;state school&#x27;) 
* School vouchers are subsidies given directly to parents for tuition at any school

==Economics==

===Background===
Education as a tool for human capital accumulation is often crucial to the development and progression of societies and thus governments have large incentives to continually intervene and improve public education. Additionally, education is often the tool with which societies instill a common set of values that underlie the basic norms of the society. Furthermore, there are positive externalities to society from education. These positive externalities can be in the form of reduced crime, more informed citizens and economic development, known as the neighborhood effect.

In terms of economic theory, families face a bundle of consumption choices that determine how much they will spend on education and private consumption. Any number of consumption bundles are available as long as they fit within the budget constraint. This means that any bundle of consumption of education and private consumption must not exceed budgetary constraints. Indifference curves represent the preferences of one good over another. The indifference curve determines how much education an individual will want to consume versus how much private consumption an individual will want to consume.

Government intervention in education typically takes two forms. The first approach can be broad, such as instituting charter schools, magnet schools, or for-profit schools and increasing competition. The second approach can be individually focused such as providing subsidies or loans for individuals to attend college or school vouchers for K-12.

Vouchers are typically instituted for two broad economic reasons. The first reason is consumer choice. A family can choose to where their child goes to school and pick the school that is closest to their preference of education provider.

The second reason vouchers are proposed is to increase market competition amongst schools. Similar to the free market theorem, vouchers are intended to make schools more competitive while lowering costs for schools and increasing the educational quality for consumers, the families.

===Effects===

====Negative effects====
Besides the general lack of results, critics of school vouchers argue that vouchers will lead to segregation. Empirical studies show that there is some evidence that school vouchers can lead to racial or income segregation. However, research on this topic is inconclusive, as there is also valid research that shows under certain circumstances, income and racial segregation can be reduced indirectly by increasing school choice.

Additionally, since school vouchers are funded by the government, the implementation could cause the funds for public schools to be reduced. Private-school vouchers affect government budgets through two channels: additional direct voucher expenditures, and public school cost savings from lower enrollments. Voucher programs would be paid for by the government&#x27;s education budget, which would be subtracted from the public school&#x27;s budget. This might affect the public school system by giving them less to spend and use for their student&#x27;s education.

A 2018 study by Abdulkadiroğlu et al. found that disadvantaged students who won a lottery (the Louisiana Scholarship Program) to get vouchers to attend private schools had worse education outcomes than disadvantaged students who did not win vouchers: &quot;LSP participation lowers math scores by 0.4 standard deviations and also reduces achievement in reading, science, and social studies. These effects may be due in part to selection of low-quality private schools into the program&quot;.

====Positive effects====
A 2021 meta-analysis by Shakeel et al., published in the journal &quot; School Effectiveness and School Improvement&quot;, evaluated evidence from randomized controlled trials assessing &quot;student-level math and reading test score effects of school vouchers internationally.&quot; After evaluating 21 studies addressing 11 different voucher programs, the meta-analysis authors found &quot;moderate evidence of positive achievement impacts of private school vouchers, with substantial effect heterogeneity across programs and outcome years&quot; as well as evidence suggesting that &quot;voucher interventions may be cost-effective even for null achievement impacts.&quot; The study authors noted that future experimental studies might yield more facts on whether and how &quot;long-term, scaled-up voucher interventions&quot; affect student achievement.

==Implementations==

===Colombia===
The PACES voucher program was established by the Colombian government in late 1991. It aimed to assist low-income households by distributing school vouchers to students living in neighborhoods situated in the two lowest socioeconomic strata. Between 1991 and 1997, the PACES program awarded 125,000 vouchers to lower-income secondary school students. Those vouchers were worth about US$190 in 1998, and data shows that matriculation fees and other monthly expenses incurred by voucher students attending private schools averaged about US$340 in 1998, so a majority of voucher recipients supplemented the voucher with personal funds.

The students selected to be in the program were selected by lottery. The vouchers were able to be renewed annually, conditional on students achieving satisfactory academic success as indicated by scheduled grade promotion. The program also included incentives to study harder as well as widening schooling options. Empirical evidence showed that the program had some success. Joshua Angrist shows that after three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to attend private school and complete 0.1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished the 8th grade. The study also reported that there were larger voucher effects for boys than for girls, especially in mathematics performance. The program did not have a significant impact on dropout rates. Angrist reports that lottery winners scored 0.2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. The voucher program also reported some social effects. Lottery winners worked less on average than non-lottery winners. Angrist reports that this was correlated with a decreased likelihood to marry or cohabit as teenagers.

===Chile===
In 1981, Chile implemented a universal school voucher system for both elementary and secondary school students. As a result, over 1,000 private schools entered the market, and private enrollment increased by 20–40% by 1998, surpassing 50% in some urban areas. From 1981 to 1988, the private school enrollment rate in urban areas grew 11% more than the private school enrollment rate in rural areas. This change coincided with the transfer of public school administration from the central government to local municipalities. The financial value of a voucher did not depend on the income of the family receiving it, and the program allowed private voucher schools to be selective, while public schools had to accept and enroll every interested student. At the turn of the 21st century, student achievement in Chile was low compared to students in other nations based on international test scores. This disparity led to the Chilean government enacting substantial educational reforms in 2008, including major changes in the school voucher system.

The Chilean government passed the Preferential School Subsidy Law (SEP) in January 2008. This piece of legislation made the educational voucher system much more like the regulated compensatory model championed by Christopher Jencks. Under SEP, the voucher system was altered to take family incomes into account. The vouchers provided to &quot;priority students&quot; – those whose family income was in the lower than 40% of Chileans – were worth 50% more than those given to the families with higher income. Schools with larger numbers of priority students were eligible to receive per-student bonuses, the size of which was tied to the percentage of priority students in the student body. When SEP was started, it covered preschool to fourth grade, and an additional school year of coverage was added each subsequent year. Almost every public school chose to participate in SEP in 2008, as well as almost two-thirds of private subsidized elementary schools.

There were three important requirements attached to the program. The first requirement stipulated that participating schools could not charge fees to priority students, although private schools in the voucher system could do so for non-priority students. The second requirement ensured that schools could not select students based on their academic ability, nor expel them on academic grounds. The third requirement postulated that schools had to self-enroll themselves in an accountability system that ensured that schools were responsible for the use of financial resources and student test scores.

===Europe===
In most European countries, education for all primary and secondary schools is fully subsidized. In some countries (e.g., Belgium or France), parents are free to choose which school their child attends.

====France====

Parents can choose either a private school or a public school. Most private schools are under contract to the French government in which case the French government pays teachers&#x27; salaries and they are considered state employees. Other costs at private schools are paid through fees which are usually low. Schools under contract follow the French national curriculum. Some private schools are not under contract giving them more freedom to teach different curricula although the state still monitors educational standards. Teachers&#x27; salaries at private schools not &#x27;under contract&#x27; are paid through fees that are therefore much higher than those under contract. About 20% of French schoolchildren attend private schools. Homeschooling is possible but restricted in France. Indeed, on October 2, 2022, Emmanuel Macron reinforced secularism by allowing homeschooling only under specific circumstances, such as for individuals with disabilities, high-level athletes or artists, or those belonging to nomadic communities, as part of measures to combat the spread of obscurantism in some families.

====Ireland====

Most schools in the Republic of Ireland are state-aided Catholic parish schools, established under diocesan patronage but with capital costs, teachers&#x27; salaries, and a fee per head paid to the school. These are given to the school regardless of whether or not it requires its students to pay fees. (Although fee-paying schools are in the minority, there has been much criticism over the state aid they receive. Opponents claim that the aid gives them an unfair advantage.)

There is a recent trend towards multi-denominational schools established by parents and organised as limited companies without share capital. Parents and students are free to choose their own schools. If a school fails to attract students, it immediately loses its fees and eventually loses its teaching posts, and teachers are moved to other schools that are attracting students. The system is perceived to have achieved very successful outcomes for most Irish children.

The 1995–97 &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; government, containing ministers from parties of the center-right and the left, introduced free third-level education to primary degree level. Critics charge that this has not increased the number of students from economically deprived backgrounds attending university. However, studies have shown that the removal of tuition fees at third level has increased the numbers of students overall and of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Since the economic crisis of 2008, there has been extensive debate regarding the possible reintroduction of third-level fees.

====Sweden====

In Sweden, a system of school vouchers (called &quot;skolpeng&quot;) was introduced in 1992 at primary and secondary school level, enabling free choice among publicly run schools and privately run &quot;fristående skolor&quot; (&quot;independent schools&quot;). The voucher is paid with public funds from the local municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;) directly to a school based solely on its number of students. Both public schools and independent schools are funded the same way. Independent schools can be run by not-for-profit groups as well as by for-profit companies, but may not charge top-up fees or select students other than on a first-come, first-served basis. Over 10% of Swedish students were enrolled in independent schools in 2008 and the number is growing fast, leading the country to be viewed as a pioneer of the model.

Per Unckel, governor of Stockholm and former Minister of Education, has promoted the system, saying &quot;Education is so important that you can&#x27;t just leave it to one producer, because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes.&quot; The Swedish system has been recommended to Barack Obama by some commentators, including the Pacific Research Institute, which has released a documentary called &quot;Not As Good As You Think: Myth of the Middle Class Schools&quot;, a movie depicting positive benefits for middle class schools resulting from Sweden&#x27;s voucher programs.

A 2004 study concluded that school results in public schools improved due to increased competition. However, Per Thulberg, director general of the Swedish National Agency for Education, has said that the system &quot;has not led to better results&quot; and in the 2000s Sweden&#x27;s ranking in the PISA league tables worsened. Though Rachel Wolf, director of the New Schools Network, has suggested that Sweden&#x27;s education standards had slipped for reasons other than as a result of independent schools.

A 2015 study was able to show that &quot;an increase in the share of independent school students improves average short‐ and long‐run outcomes, explained primarily by external effects (e.g., school competition)&quot;.

===Hong Kong===
A voucher system for children three to six years old who attend a non-profit kindergarten was implemented in Hong Kong in 2007. Each child will get HK$13,000 per year. The $13,000 subsidy will be separated into two parts: $10,000 is used to subsidize the school fee, and the remaining $3,000 is used for kindergarten teachers to pursue further education and obtain a certificate in education. Also, there are some restrictions on the voucher system. Parents can only choose non-profit schools with a yearly fee of less than $24,000. The government hoped that all kindergarten teachers can obtain an education certificate by the year 2011–12, at which point the subsidies are to be adjusted to $16,000 for each student, all of which will go toward the school fee.

Milton Friedman criticised the system, saying &quot;I do not believe that CE Mr. Tsang&#x27;s proposal is properly structured.&quot; He said that the whole point of a voucher system is to provide a competitive marketplace so should not be limited to non-profit kindergartens. 

After protests by parents with children enrolled in for-profit kindergartens, the program was extended to children in for-profit kindergartens, but only for children enrolled in or before September 2007. The government will also provide up to HK$30,000 subsidy to for-profit kindergartens wanting to convert to non-profit.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistani Punjab, the Education Voucher Scheme (EVS) was introduced by Dr. Allah Bakhsh Malik, managing director and chief executive of the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), especially in urban slums and the poorest of the poor in 2005. The initial study was sponsored by Open Society Institute New York USA. Professor Henry M. Levin extended pro-bono services for children of poor families from Punjab. To ensure educational justice and integration, the government must ensure that the poorest families have equal access to quality education. The voucher scheme was designed by the Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Open Society Institute. It aims to promote freedom of choice, efficiency, equity, and social cohesion.

A pilot project was started in 2006 in the urban slums of Sukhnehar, Lahore, where a survey showed that all households lived below the poverty line. Through the EVS, the foundation would deliver education vouchers to every household with children 5–16 years of age. The vouchers would be redeemable against tuition payments at participating private schools. In the pilot stage, 1,053 households were given an opportunity to send their children to a private school of their choice. The EVS makes its partner schools accountable to the parents rather than to the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education. In the FAS program, every school principal has the choice to admit a student or not. However, in the EVS, a partner school cannot refuse a student if the student has a voucher, and the family has chosen that school. The partner schools are also accountable to the PEF: they are subject to periodic reviews of their student learning outcomes, additional private investments, and improvements in the working conditions of the teachers. The EVS provides an incentive to parents to send their children to school, and so it has become a source of competition among private schools seeking to join the program.

When it comes to the selection of schools, the following criteria are applied across the board: (i) The fee paid by the PEF to EVS partner schools is PKR 550 per child per month. Schools charging higher fees can also apply to the program, but they will not be paid more than PKR 1200, and they will not be entitled to charge the difference to students&#x27; families. (ii) Total school enrollment should be at least 50 children. (iii) The school should have adequate infrastructure and a good learning environment. (iv) EVS partner schools should be located within a half-kilometer radius of the residences of voucher holders. However, if the parents prefer a particular school farther away, the PEF will not object, provided that the school fulfills the EVS selection criteria. (v) The PEF advertises to stimulate the interest of potential partner schools. It then gives students at short-listed schools preliminary tests in selected subjects and conducts physical inspections of these schools. PEF offices display a list of all the EVS partner schools so that parents may consult it and choose a school for their children.

By now more than 500,000 students are benefiting from EVS and the program is being scaled up by financing from the Government of Punjab.

==School voucher public policy in the United States==

In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pushed for vouchers, as did the George W. Bush administration in the initial education reform proposals leading up to the No Child Left Behind Act. As of December 2016, 14 states had traditional school voucher programs. These states consist of: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., also had operating school voucher programs as of December 2016. When including scholarship tax credits and education savings accounts – two alternatives to vouchers – there are 27 states plus the District of Columbia with private school choice programs. Most of these programs were offered to students in low-income families, low-performing schools, or students with disabilities. By 2014, the number participating in either vouchers or tax-credit scholarships increased to 250,000, a 30% increase from 2010, but still a small fraction compared to the 55 million in traditional schools.

In 1990, the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin&#x27;s public schools implemented a program called the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. Originally, this funded school vouchers for nonreligious, private institutions. It was, however, eventually expanded to include private, religious institutions after it saw success with nonreligious, private institutions. The 2006/07 school year marked the first time in Milwaukee that more than $100 million was paid in vouchers. Twenty-six percent of Milwaukee students will receive public funding to attend schools outside the traditional Milwaukee Public School system. In fact, if the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin. St. Anthony Catholic School, located on Milwaukee&#x27;s south side, boasts 966 voucher students, meaning that it very likely receives more public money for general school support of a parochial elementary or high school than any before it in American history. A 2013 study of Milwaukee&#x27;s program posited that the use of vouchers increased the probability that a student would graduate from high school, go to college, and stay in college. A 2015 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that participation in Louisiana&#x27;s voucher program &quot;substantially reduces academic achievement&quot; although that the result may be reflective of the poor quality of private schools in the program.

A recent analysis of the competitive effects of school vouchers in Florida suggests that more competition improves performance in the regular public schools.

The largest school voucher program in the United States is the Indiana Choice Scholarships program.

===Opponents===
The main critique of school vouchers and education tax credits is that they put public education in competition with private education, threatening to reduce and reallocate public school funding to private schools. Opponents question the belief that private schools are more efficient.

Public school teachers and teacher unions have also fought against school vouchers. In the United States, public school teacher unions, most notably the National Education Association (the largest labor union in the US), argue that school vouchers erode educational standards and reduce funding and that giving money to parents who choose to send their child to a religious or other school is unconstitutional. The latter issue was struck down by the Supreme Court case &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot;, which upheld Ohio&#x27;s voucher plan in a 5–4 ruling. In contrast, the use of public-school funding for vouchers to private schools was disallowed by the Louisiana Supreme Court in 2013. The Louisiana Supreme Court did not declare vouchers unconstitutional, just the use of money earmarked for public schools via the Louisiana Constitution for funding Louisiana&#x27;s voucher program. The National Education Association also points out that access to vouchers is just like &quot;a chance in a lottery&quot; where parents had to be lucky to get a space in this program. Since almost all students and their families would like to choose the best schools, those schools, as a result, quickly reach its maximum capacity number for students that state law permits. Those who did not get vouchers then have to compete again to look for some other less preferred and competitive schools or give up searching and go back to their assigned local schools. Jonathan Kozol, a prominent public school reform thinker and former public-school teacher called vouchers the &quot;single worst, most dangerous idea to have entered education discourse in my adult life&quot;.

The National Education Association additionally argues that more money should go towards public education to help the schools struggling and improve the schools overall, instead of reducing the public school&#x27;s fund to go towards school vouchers. Their argument claims that increasing that amount of money that goes towards public education would also increase the amount of resources put into public schools, therefore, improving the education. This argument made towards school vouchers reflects the way the organization values public education. For example, in an interview in May 2017 regarding Donald Trump&#x27;s 2018 Budget Proposal, the organization&#x27;s president, Lily Eskelsen García, claimed:

&quot;We should invest in what makes schools great, the things that build curiosity and instill a love of learning. That is what every student deserves and what every parent wants for his or her child. It should not depend on how much their parents make, what language they speak at home, and certainly, not what neighborhood they live in.&quot; – National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen García.

Furthermore, there are multiple studies that support the arguments made by opponents of school vouchers. One of these studies, conducted by the Tulane University&#x27;s Education Research Alliance, consists of observing the relationship between voucher programs and students&#x27; test scores. They found that students in the Louisiana voucher program initially had lower test scores, but after three years, their scores matched those of students who stayed in public schools from standardized test scores spanning from 2012 to 2015.

People who can benefit from vouchers may not know it. In April 2012, a bill passed in Louisiana that made vouchers available to low-income families whose children attended poorly ranked schools. A student whose household income was low (up to about $44,000 for a family of three) and who attended a school ranked &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, or &quot;F&quot; could apply for vouchers to attend another. Of the estimated 380,000 eligible students during the school year when the bill was passed (2012/13), only 5,000 students knew about and applied for the vouchers, and accepted them.

In 2006, the United States Department of Education released a report concluding that average test scores for reading and mathematics, when adjusted for student and school characteristics, tend to be very similar among public schools and private schools. Private schools performed significantly better than public schools only if results were not adjusted for factors such as race, gender, and free or reduced-price lunch program eligibility. Other research questions assumptions that large improvements would result from a more comprehensive voucher system.

Given the limited budget for schools, it is claimed that a voucher system would weaken public schools while not providing enough money for people to attend private schools. 76% of the money given in Arizona&#x27;s voucher program went to children already in private schools.

Some sources claim that public schools&#x27; higher per-pupil spending is due to having a higher proportion of students with behavioral, physical, and emotional problems since in the United States, public schools must by law accept any student regardless of race, gender, religion, disability, educational aptitude, and so forth, while private schools are not so bound. They argue that some, if not all, of the cost difference between public and private schools comes from &quot;cream skimming&quot;, whereby the private schools select only those students who belong to a preferred group – whether economic, religious, educational aptitude level, or ethnicity – rather than from differences in administration. The result, it has been argued, is that a voucher system has led or would lead students who do not belong to the private schools&#x27; preferred groupings to become concentrated at public schools. However, of the ten state-run voucher programs in the United States at the beginning of 2011, four targeted low-income students, two targeted students in failing schools, and six targeted students with special needs. (Louisiana ran a single program targeting all three groups.)

It is also argued that voucher programs are often implemented without the necessary safeguards that prevent institutions from discriminating against marginalized communities. In the United States, as of 2016, there are currently no state laws that require voucher programs to not discriminate against marginalized communities. Further, while some voucher programs may explicitly be aimed at marginalized communities, this is not necessarily always the case. A common argument for school vouchers is that it allows for marginalized communities of color to be uplifted from poverty. Historically, however, data suggests that voucher programs have been used to further segregate Americans. Further, some data has shown that the effects of voucher programs such as the New York City School Choice Scholarship Program, are marginal when it comes to increasing student achievement.

Another argument against a school voucher system is its lack of accountability to taxpayers. In many states, members of a community&#x27;s board of education are elected by voters. Similarly, a school budget faces a referendum. Meetings of the Board of Education must be announced in advance, and members of the public are permitted to voice their concerns directly to board members. By contrast, although vouchers may be used in private and religious schools, taxpayers cannot vote on budget issues, elect members of the board or even attend board meetings. Even voucher proponents acknowledge that decreased transparency and accountability for public funds are problematic features of the voucher system, and some have suggested a &#x27;sliding scale&#x27; approach wherein oversight and accountability increase in proportion to the number of taxpayer dollars (in the form of vouchers) received by the private school.

Kevin Welner points out that vouchers funded through a convoluted tax credit system – a policy he calls &quot;neovouchers&quot; – present additional accountability concerns. With neovoucher systems, a taxpayer owing money to the state instead donates that money to a private, nonprofit organization. That organization then bundles donations and gives them to parents as vouchers to be used for private school tuition. The state then steps in and forgives (through a tax credit) some or all of the taxes that the donor has given to the organization. While conventional tax credit systems are structured to treat all private school participants equally, neovoucher systems effectively delegate to individual private taxpayers (those owing money to the state) the power to decide which private schools will benefit.

An example of a lack of accountability is the voucher situation in Louisiana. In 2012, Louisiana State Superintendent of Education John White selected private schools to receive vouchers, then tried to fabricate criteria (including site visits) after schools had already received approval letters. One school of note, New Living Word in Ruston, Louisiana, did not have sufficient facilities for the over 300 students White and the state board of education had approved. Following a voucher audit in 2013, New Living Word had overcharged the state $395,000. White referred to the incident as a &quot;lone substantive issue&quot;. However, most voucher schools did not undergo a complete audit for not having a separate checking account for state voucher money.

According to Susanne Wiborg, an expert on comparative education, Sweden&#x27;s voucher system introduced in 1992 has &quot;augmented social and ethnic segregation, particularly in relation to schools in deprived areas&quot;.

Tax-credit scholarships which are in most part disbursed to current private school students or to families which made substantial donations to the scholarship fund, rather than to low-income students attempting to escape from failing schools, amount to nothing more than a mechanism to use public funds in the form of foregone taxes to support private, often religiously based, private schools.

===Proponents===
Proponents of school vouchers and education tax credit systems argue that those systems promote free market competition among both private and public schools by allowing parents and students to choose the school to use the vouchers. This choice available to parents&#x27; forces schools to perpetually improve to maintain enrollment. Thus, proponents argue that a voucher system increases school performance and accountability because it provides consumer sovereignty – allowing individuals to choose what product to buy, as opposed to a bureaucracy.

This argument is supported by studies such as &quot;When Schools Compete: The Effects of Vouchers on Florida Public School Achievement&quot; (Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, 2003), which concluded that public schools located near private schools that were eligible to accept voucher students made significantly more improvements than did similar schools not located near eligible private schools. Stanford&#x27;s Caroline Hoxby, who has researched the systemic effects of school choice, determined that areas with greater residential school choice have consistently higher test scores at a lower per-pupil cost than areas with very few school districts. Hoxby studied the effects of vouchers in Milwaukee and of charter schools in Arizona and Michigan on nearby public schools. Public schools forced to compete made greater test-score gains than schools not faced with such competition, and that the so-called effect of cream skimming did not exist in any of the voucher districts examined. Hoxby&#x27;s research has found that both private and public schools improved through the use of vouchers.

Similarly, it is argued that such competition has helped in higher education, with publicly funded universities directly competing with private universities for tuition money provided by the Government, such as the GI Bill and the Pell Grant in the United States. The Foundation for Educational Choice alleges that a school voucher plan &quot;embodies exactly the same principle as the GI bills that provide for educational benefits to military veterans. The veteran gets a voucher good only for educational expense and he is completely free to choose the school at which he uses it, provided that it satisfies certain standards&quot;. The Pell Grant, a need-based aid, like the Voucher, can only be used for authorized school expenses at qualified schools, and, like the Pell, the money follows the student, for use against those authorized expenses (not all expenses are covered).

Proponents are encouraged by private school sector growth, as they believe that private schools are typically more efficient at achieving results at a much lower per-pupil cost than public schools. A CATO Institute study of public and private school per pupil spending in Phoenix, Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, New York City, and Houston found that public schools spend 93% more than the estimated median private schools.

Proponents claim that institutions often are forced to operate more efficiently when they are made to compete and that any resulting job losses in the public sector would be offset by the increased demand for jobs in the private sector.

Friedrich von Hayek on the privatizing of education:

Other notable supporters include New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, former governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford, billionaire and American philanthropist John T. Walton, Former mayor of Baltimore Kurt L. Schmoke, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and John McCain. A random survey of 210 Ph.D.-holding members of the American Economic Association, found that over two-thirds of economists support giving parents educational vouchers that can be used at government-operated or privately operated schools, and that support is greater if the vouchers are to be used by parents with low-incomes or parents with children in poorly performing schools.

Another prominent proponent of the voucher system was Apple co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, who said:

As a practical matter, proponents note, most U.S. programs only offer poor families the same choice more affluent families already have, by providing them with the means to leave a failing school and attend one where the child can get an education. Because public schools are funded on a per-pupil basis, the money simply follows the child, but the cost to taxpayers is less because the voucher generally is less than the actual cost.

In addition, they say, the comparisons of public and private schools on average are meaningless. Vouchers usually are used by children in failing schools, so they can hardly be worse off even if the parents fail to choose a better school. Also, focusing on the effect on public school suggests that is more important than the education of children.

Some proponents of school vouchers, including the Sutherland Institute and many supporters of the Utah voucher effort, see it as a remedy for the negative cultural impact caused by underperforming public schools, which falls disproportionately on demographic minorities. During the run-up to the November referendum election, Sutherland issued a controversial publication: Voucher, Vows, &amp; Vexations. Sutherland called the publication an important review of the history of education in Utah, while critics just called it revisionist history. Sutherland then released a companion article in a law journal as part of an academic conference about school choice.

EdChoice, founded by Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a non-profit organization that promotes universal school vouchers and other forms of school choice. In defense of vouchers, it cites empirical research showing that students who were randomly assigned to receive vouchers had higher academic outcomes than students who applied for vouchers but lost a random lottery and did not receive them; and that vouchers improve academic outcomes at public schools, reduce racial segregation, deliver better services to special education students, and do not drain money from public schools.

EdChoice also argues that education funding should belong to children, not a specific school type or building. Their purpose for the argument is to try to argue that people should prioritize a student&#x27;s education and their opportunity over making a specific type of school better. They also emphasize that if a family chooses a public school, the funds also go to that school. This would mean that it would also benefit those who value the public education system.

====Legal challenges====
The school voucher question in the United States also received a considerable amount of judicial review in the early 2000s.

A program launched in the city of Cleveland in 1995 and authorized by the state of Ohio was challenged in court on the grounds that it violated both the federal constitutional principle of separation of church and state and the guarantee of religious liberty in the Ohio Constitution. These claims were rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court, but the federal claims were upheld by the local federal district court and by the Sixth Circuit appeals court. The fact that nearly all of the families using vouchers attended Catholic schools in the Cleveland area was cited in the decisions.

This was later reversed in 2002 in a landmark case before the US Supreme Court, &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot;, in which the divided court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled the Ohio school voucher plan constitutional and removed any constitutional barriers to similar voucher plans in the future, with conservative justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas in the majority.

Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated that &quot;The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients, not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.&quot; The Supreme Court ruled that the Ohio program did not violate the Establishment Clause, because it passed a five-part test developed by the Court in this case, titled the Private Choice Test.

Dissenting opinions included Justice Stevens&#x27;s, who wrote &quot;...the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government&#x27;s choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible&quot; and Justice Souter&#x27;s, whose opinion questioned how the Court could keep &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; on as precedent and decide this case in the way they did, feeling it was contradictory.

In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down legislation known as the Florida Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), which would have implemented a system of school vouchers in Florida. The court ruled that the OSP violated article IX, section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution: &quot;Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high-quality system of free public schools.&quot; This decision was criticized by Clark Neily, Institute for Justice senior attorney and legal counsel to Pensacola families using Florida Opportunity Scholarships, as &quot;educational policymaking&quot;.

====Political support====
Political support for school vouchers in the United States is mixed. On the left/right spectrum, conservatives are more likely to support vouchers. Some state legislatures have enacted voucher laws. In New Mexico, then-Republican Gary Johnson made school voucher provision the major issue of his second term as governor. The federal government provided a voucher program for 7,500 residents of Washington, D.C., called the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The program operated until in early March 2009, when congressional Democrats moved to close down the program and remove children from their voucher-funded school places at the end of the 2009/10 school year under the $410 billion Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 which, as of March 7 had passed the House and was pending in the Senate. The Obama administration stated that it preferred to allow children already enrolled in the program to finish their schooling while closing the program to new entrants. However, its preference on this matter was not strong enough to prevent the president from signing the bill.

Whether or not the public generally supports vouchers is debatable. Majorities seem to favor improving existing schools over providing vouchers, yet as many as 40% of those surveyed admit that they do not know enough to form an opinion or do not understand the system of school vouchers.

In November 2000, a voucher system proposed by Tim Draper was placed on the California ballot as Proposition 38. It was unusual among school voucher proposals in that it required neither accreditation on the part of schools accepting vouchers, nor proof of need on the part of families applying for them; neither did it have any requirement that schools accept vouchers as payment-in-full, nor any other provision to guarantee a reduction in the real cost of private school tuition. The measure was defeated by a final percentage tally of 70.6 to 29.4.

A statewide universal school voucher system providing a maximum tuition subsidy of $3,000 was passed in Utah in 2007, but 62% of voters repealed it in a statewide referendum before it took effect. On April 27, 2011, Indiana passed a statewide voucher program, the largest in the U.S. It offers up to $4,500 to students with household incomes under $41,000, and lesser benefits to households with higher incomes. The vouchers can be used to fund a variety of education options outside the public school system. In March 2013, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the program does not violate the state constitution.

==== Trump&#x27;s 2018 Budget ====
President Donald Trump proposed a 2018 budget that included $250 million for voucher initiatives, state-funded programs that pay for students to go to private school. This 2018 budget served the purpose of &quot;Expanding school choice, ensuring more children have an equal opportunity to receive a great education, maintaining strong support for the Nation&#x27;s most vulnerable students, simplifying funding for post-secondary education, continuing to build evidence around educational innovation, and eliminating or reducing Department programs consistent with the limited Federal role in education.&quot; The Budget reduced more than 30 programs that duplicated other programs; that were deemed ineffective; or that were more appropriately supported with state, local, or private funds. Another $1 billion was set aside for encouraging schools to adopt school choice-friendly policies.
Betsy DeVos, Trump&#x27;s education secretary from 2017 to 2021, is also an advocate for voucher programs and has argued that they would lead to better educational outcomes for students. Both Trump and DeVos proposed cutting the Education Department&#x27;s budget by about $3.6 billion and spend more than $1 billion on private school vouchers and other school choice plans.

Regarding the purpose and importance of the budget, DeVos claimed:

This budget makes an historic investment in America&#x27;s students. President Trump is committed to ensuring the Department focuses on returning decision-making power back to the States, where it belongs, and on giving parents more control over their child&#x27;s education. By refocusing the Department&#x27;s funding priorities on supporting students, we can usher in a new era of creativity and ingenuity and lay a new foundation for American greatness. – Betsy DeVos, U.S. Secretary of Education

====Teaching creationism instead of evolution====
Some private religious schools in voucher programs teach creationism instead of the theory of evolution, including religious schools that teach religious theology side by side with or in place of science. Over 300 schools in the U.S. have been documented as teaching creationism and receiving taxpayer money. A strict definition of state-funded religious education was narrowly deemed constitutional in &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot; (2002). At least 35 states have passed various Blaine Amendments restricting or prohibiting public funding of religious education. However, &quot;Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue&quot; (2020) ruled that it is unconstitutional to disqualify all religious schools from receiving public funds that other private schools are eligible to get.

<text>Elwyn Brooks White (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985) was an American writer. He was the author of several highly popular books for children, including &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1945), &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot; (1970). 

In a 2012 survey of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; readers, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; was ranked first in their poll of the top one hundred children&#x27;s novels. White also was a contributing editor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine and co-author of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, an English language style guide. Kurt Vonnegut called White &quot;one of the most admirable prose stylists our country has so far produced.&quot; 

==Early life, family and education==
White was born in Mount Vernon, New York, on July 11, 1899, the sixth and youngest child of Samuel Tilly White, the president of a piano firm, and Jessie Hart White, the daughter of Scottish-American painter William Hart. Elwyn&#x27;s older brother Stanley Hart White, known as Stan, a professor of landscape architecture and the inventor of the vertical garden, taught E.B. White to read and explore the natural world.

White attended Cornell University, where he was briefly a private in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), created by the US Department of War in 1918 to hasten the training of US soldiers for World War I in Europe. Students continued to take college courses while training for the army. Unlike the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC), SATC students were required to live and take all meals on campus and adhered to a strict military schedule of study and training. They also required a pass to go off campus on weekends. Following the end of World War I, the SATC program was disbanded in December 1918, and White did not serve with the active armed forces.

In 1921, White graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Cornell, he obtained the nickname &quot;Andy&quot;, where tradition confers that moniker on any male student whose surname is White after Cornell co-founder Andrew Dickson White. He worked as editor of &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot; with classmate Allison Danzig, who later became a sportswriter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. As a Cornell University student, White was a member of Aleph Samach, Quill and Dagger, and Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

==Career==

After graduating from Cornell, White went to work for the United Press, later United Press International, and the American Legion News Service in 1921 and 1922. From September 1922 to June 1923, he was a cub reporter for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. On one occasion, when White was stuck writing a story, a &quot;Times&quot; editor said, &quot;Just say the words.&quot; 

White was fired from the &quot;Times&quot; and later wrote for the rival &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; before a stint in Alaska on a fireboat. He then worked for almost two years with the Frank Seaman advertising agency as a production assistant and copywriter before returning to New York City in 1924. 

In 1925, after &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was founded, White began submitting manuscripts to the magazine. Katharine Angell, the literary editor, recommended to editor-in-chief and founder Harold Ross that White be hired as a staff writer. However, it took months to convince White to attend a meeting at the office and additional weeks to convince him to work on the premises. He eventually agreed to work in the office on Thursdays.

White published his first article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927, and continued to write for the magazine for nearly six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned &quot;Notes and Comment&quot; pieces, he gradually became the magazine&#x27;s most important contributor. From the beginning to the end of his career at &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; he frequently provided what the magazine calls &quot;Newsbreaks&quot;, which were short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources, under various categories, such as &quot;Block That Metaphor.&quot; He also was a columnist for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1938 to 1943.

In 1929, White coauthored with James Thurber on Is Sex Necessary? In 1949, White published &quot;Here Is New York&quot;, a short book based on an article he had been commissioned to write for &quot;Holiday&quot;. Editor Ted Patrick approached White about writing the essay, telling him it would be fun. &quot;Writing is never &#x27;fun, White replied. That article reflects the writer&#x27;s appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both &quot;the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.&quot; It concludes with a dark note touching on the forces that could destroy the city that he loved. This prescient &quot;love letter&quot; to the city was re-published in 1999 on his centennial with an introduction by his stepson, Roger Angell.

In 1959, White edited and updated &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of American English was first written and published in 1918 by William Strunk Jr., one of White&#x27;s professors at Cornell. White&#x27;s reworking of the book was extremely well received, and later editions followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. Maira Kalman illustrated an edition in 2005. That same year, Nico Muhly, a New York City composer, premiered a short opera based on the book. The volume is a standard tool for students and writers and remains required reading in many composition classes. The complete history of &quot;The Elements of Style &quot;is detailed in Mark Garvey&#x27;s &quot;Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White&#x27;s The Elements of Style&quot;.

In 1978, White was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize, citing &quot;his letters, essays and the full body of his work&quot;. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 and honorary memberships in a variety of literary societies throughout the United States. The 1973 Oscar-nominated Canadian animated short &quot;The Family That Dwelt Apart&quot; was narrated by White and was based on his short story of the same name.

===Children&#x27;s books===
In the late 1930s, White turned his hand to children&#x27;s fiction on behalf of a niece, Janice Hart White. His first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, was published in 1945, and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; followed in 1952. &quot;Stuart Little&quot; initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim, and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; won a Newbery Honor from the American Library Association, though it lost out on winning the Newbery Medal to &quot;Secret of the Andes&quot; by Ann Nolan Clark.

White received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the U.S. professional children&#x27;s librarians in 1970. It recognized his &quot;substantial and lasting contributions to children&#x27;s literature.&quot; That year, he was also the U.S. nominee and eventual runner-up for the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award, as he was again in 1976. Also, in 1970, White&#x27;s third children&#x27;s novel was published, &quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot;. In 1973 it won the Sequoyah Award from Oklahoma and the William Allen White Award from Kansas, both selected by students voting for their favorite book of the year. In 2012, the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; sponsored a survey of readers, which identified &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; as the best children&#x27;s novel (&quot;fictional title for readers 8–12&quot; years old). The librarian who conducted it said, &quot;It is impossible to conduct a poll of this sort and expect [White&#x27;s novel] to be anywhere but #1.&quot;

==Personal life==
White was shy around women, claiming he had &quot;too small a heart, too large a pen&quot;. But in 1929, after an affair that led to Katharine Angell&#x27;s divorce, she and White were married. They had a son, Joel White, a naval architect and boat builder, who later owned Brooklin Boat Yard in Brooklin, Maine. Katharine&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Roger Angell, spent decades as a fiction editor for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and was well known as the magazine&#x27;s baseball writer.

In her foreword to &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, Kate DiCamillo quotes White as saying, &quot;All that I hope to say in books, all that I ever hope to say, is that I love the world.&quot; White also loved animals, farms and farming implements, seasons, and weather formats.

James Thurber described White as a quiet man who disliked publicity and who, during his time at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, would slip out of his office via the fire escape to a nearby branch of Schrafft&#x27;s to avoid visitors he didn&#x27;t know: 

Later in life, White developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on October 1, 1985, at his farm home in North Brooklin, Maine. He is buried in the Brooklin Cemetery beside Katharine, who died in 1977.

==Legacy==
The E. B. White Read Aloud Award is given by The Association of Booksellers for Children (ABC) to honor books that its membership feel embodies the universal read-aloud standards that E.B. White&#x27;s works created.

The Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University Library holds the E.B. White Collection, an archive of manuscripts, letters, photographs, cassette tapes regarding E. B. White, including over 25,000 letters sent to him. For example, when Late Night show host Conan O&#x27;Brien reminisced about the return letter he received from E. B. White after writing him a letter at the age of 16, Cornell&#x27;s Olin Library found that letter for him. During the 2025 Palisades Fire, O&#x27;Brien recalled that when he was told to evacuate, his wife asked what to grab, and he replied, &quot;Just grab the E.B. White letter off the wall.&quot;

<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, an evangelist is an ordained office of the ministry. In some denominations of the movement, an evangelist is referred to as a [[patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]]. However, the latter term was deprecated by the Community of Christ after the church began ordaining women to the priesthood. Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), have an evangelist position independent of the original &quot;patriarch&quot; office instituted movement founder Joseph Smith.

==Early Latter Day Saint movement==
The first use of the term &quot;evangelist&quot; in Latter Day Saint theology were mainly consistent with how the term is used by Protestants and Catholics.

In 1833, Joseph Smith introduced the new office of patriarch, to which he ordained his father. The elder Smith was given the &quot;keys of the patriarchal Priesthood over the kingdom of God on earth&quot;, the same power said to be held by the Biblical patriarchs, which included the power to give blessings upon one&#x27;s posterity. The elder Smith, however, was also called to give patriarchal blessings to the fatherless within the church, and the church as a whole, a calling he passed onto his eldest surviving son Hyrum Smith prior to his death. Hyrum himself was killed in 1844 along with Joseph, resulting in a succession crisis that broke the Latter Day Saint movement into multiple denominations.

It is not known who first identified the term &quot;evangelist&quot; with the office of patriarch. However, in an 1835 church publication, W. W. Phelps stated,

:&quot;[W]ho is not desirous of receiving a father&#x27;s or an evangelist&#x27;s blessing? Who can read the ancient patriarchal blessings, recorded in the bible, for the benefit of the church, without a heart filled with joy ... ?&quot;

In 1839, Joseph Smith equated an evangelist with the office of patriarch, stating that &quot;an Evangelist is a Patriarch&quot;.

The necessity of an evangelist in the church organization has been reinforced repeatedly, based on the passage in Ephesians 4:11, which states, &quot;And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers&quot;. In 1834, while writing what he called the &quot;principles of salvation&quot;, prominent early Latter Day Saint Oliver Cowdery stated that:

:&quot;We do not believe that he ever had a church on earth without revealing himself to that church: consequently, there were apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, in the same.&quot;

Joseph Smith echoed Cowdery&#x27;s statement in 1842, in a letter to a Chicago newspaper editor outlining the church&#x27;s basic beliefs. Smith said that his religion &quot;believe[s] in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists&quot;.

==Community of Christ==

In the Community of Christ, which was formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), an evangelist is an office in the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood.

An evangelist-patriarch&#x27;s primary responsibility was to provide special blessings to members of the church; these blessings were considered one of the eight sacraments in the RLDS Church. The local evangelist-patriarchs of the church were governed by an individual with church-wide authority known as the Presiding Patriarch.

In 1984, when the first women began to be ordained to the office of evangelist-patriarch, the RLDS Church changed the title of the evangelist-patriarchs to simply &quot;evangelist&quot;. Similarly, it changed the title of the Presiding Patriarch to the &quot;Presiding Evangelist&quot;. To be an evangelist, a person must also be a high priest of the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood.

The primary duty of an evangelist in the Community of Christ remains the giving of sacramental &quot;evangelist&#x27;s blessings&quot;; it is for this reason that evangelists are often referred to as &quot;ministers of blessing&quot;. Ideally, an evangelist is free from administrative responsibilities in the church in order to allow them to be fully responsive to the Holy Spirit. The blessings—which are given by the laying on of hands—provide counsel and advice and confer spiritual blessings upon the recipient(s). Not only individuals, but also couples, families, households, groups and congregations may receive an evangelist&#x27;s blessing. Any person, including nonmembers, eight years of age or older can receive a blessing, although the blessing is rarely offered for someone who has not reached adolescence. A recipient may receive multiple evangelist&#x27;s blessings in their life. Evangelist&#x27;s blessings may or may not be recorded. If it is recorded in written form, a copy is stored in the church archives at Independence, Missouri.

All evangelists belong to the Order of Evangelists, which is led by the Presiding Evangelist (currently Jane M. Gardner, since 2016).

==The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==
In The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the prescribed duties of an evangelist are to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, language, and people. An evangelist is part of the Quorum of Seventy Evangelists.

===Quorum of Seventy Evangelists===
The Quorum of Seventy Evangelists is responsible for management of the International Missionary Programs of the church and assists Regions of the church with their individual Domestic Missionary Programs. The Quorum of Seventy oversees the activities of its Missionary Operating Committees to ensure the fulfilling of Christ&#x27;s commandment to take the gospel to the entire world.

In 2007, the officers of the Quorum of Seventy Evangelists were:

*Evangelist Eugene Perri, President
*Evangelist Alex Gentile, Vice-President
*Evangelist Jeffrey Giannetti, Secretary

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), an evangelist is considered to be an office of the Melchizedek priesthood. However, the term &quot;evangelist&quot; is rarely used for this position; instead, the church has retained the term &quot;patriarch&quot;, the term most commonly used by Joseph Smith.

The most prominent reference to the term &quot;evangelist&quot; in the LDS Church&#x27;s literature is found in its &quot;Articles of Faith&quot;, derived from the Wentworth letter—a statement by Smith in 1842 to a Chicago newspaper editor—that the church believes in &quot;the same organization that existed in the primitive church&quot;, including &quot;evangelists&quot;. Smith taught that &quot;an Evangelist is an Patriarch&quot;.

<doc id="9755" wikidata="Q2082412" url="?curid=9755" title="Elegiac couplet">
<text>The elegiac couplet or elegaic distich is a poetic form used by Greek lyric poets for a variety of themes usually of smaller scale than the epic. Roman poets, particularly Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid, adopted the same form in Latin many years later. As with the English heroic couplet, each pair of lines usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work.

Each couplet consists of a dactylic hexameter verse followed by a dactylic pentameter verse. The following is a graphic representation of its scansion:

 – uu | – uu | – uu | – uu | – uu | – x
 – uu | – uu | – || – uu | – uu | –
 – is one long syllable, u one short syllable, uu is one long or two short syllables, and x is one long or one short syllable (anceps).

The form was felt by the ancients to contrast the rising action of the first verse with a falling quality in the second. The sentiment is summarized in a line from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Amores&quot; I.1.27 — &quot;Sex mihi surgat opus numeris, in quinque residat&quot; — &quot;Let my work rise in six steps, fall back in five.&quot; The effect is illustrated by Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s couplet
:

translated into English by Samuel Taylor Coleridge as:
:In the hexameter rises the fountain&#x27;s silvery column,
:In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.

and by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as:
:Up goes the Hexameter with might as a fountain rising.
:Lightly the fountain falls, lightly the Pentameter.

==Greek origins==
The elegiac couplet is presumed to be the oldest Greek form of epodic poetry (a form where a later verse is sung in response or comment to a previous one). Scholars, who even in the past did not know who created it, theorize the form was originally used in Ionian dirges, with the name &quot;elegy&quot; derived from the Greek &quot;ε, λεγε ε, λεγε&quot;—&quot;Woe, cry woe, cry!&quot; Hence, the form was used initially for funeral songs, typically accompanied by an aulos, a double-reed wind instrument. Archilochus expanded use of the form to treat other themes, such as war, travel, and homespun philosophy. Between Archilochus and other imitators, the verse form became a common poetic vehicle for conveying any strong emotion.

At the end of the 7th century BCE, Mimnermus of Colophon struck on the innovation of using the verse for erotic poetry. He composed several elegies celebrating his love for the flute girl Nanno, and though fragmentary today, his poetry was clearly influential in the later Roman development of the form. Propertius, to cite one example, notes —&quot;The verse of Mimnermus is stronger in love than Homer&quot;.

The form continued to be popular throughout the Greek period and treated a number of different themes. Tyrtaeus composed elegies on a war theme, apparently for a Spartan audience. Theognis of Megara vented himself in couplets as an embittered aristocrat in a time of social change. Popular leaders were writers of elegies—Solon the lawgiver of Athens composed on political and ethical subjects—and even Plato and Aristotle dabbled with the meter.

A famous example of an elegiac couplet is the epitaph composed by Simonides of Ceos which Herodotus says was inscribed on a stone to commemorate those who died at the battle of Thermopylae in 490 BC:
: (Book VII, 228)
:

:&quot;O stranger, tell the Spartans that in this place
:we lie, obeying their commands.&quot;

Cicero translates it as follows (&quot;Tusc. Disp.&quot; 1.42.101), also using an elegiac couplet: 
:

:&quot;Say, stranger, in Sparta that you saw us lying here
:while we obey the sacred laws of our fatherland.&quot;

By the Hellenistic period, the Library of Alexandria made elegy its favorite and most highly developed form. They preferred the briefer style associated with elegy in contrast to the lengthier epic forms, and made it the singular medium for short epigrams. The founder of this school was Philitas of Cos. He was eclipsed only by the school&#x27;s most admired exponent, Callimachus; their learned character and intricate art would have a heavy influence on the Romans.

==Roman elegy==
Like many Greek forms, elegy was adapted by the Romans for their own literature. The fragments of Ennius contain a few couplets, but it is the elegists of the mid-to-late first century BCE who are most commonly associated with the distinctive Roman form of the elegiac couplet. Catullus, the first of these, is an invaluable link between the Alexandrine school and the subsequent elegies of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid. He shows a familiarity with the usual Alexandrine style of terse epigram and a wealth of mythological learning, as in his 66th poem, , a direct translation of Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Lock of Berenice&quot;. His 85th poem is famous:

To read it correctly it is necessary to take account of the three elisions:

 – u u| – –| – u u|– – | – u u| – x
 Od&#x27;et a|mo. Qua|r&#x27;id faci|am, for|tasse re|quiris?
 – uu | – uu| – || – u u | – u u|–
 Nescio, | sed fie|ri || senti&#x27;et | excruci|or.

Cornelius Gallus, an important statesman of this period, was also regarded by the ancients as a great elegist, but, except for a few lines, his work has been lost.

==Elegy in the Augustan Age==
The form reached its zenith with the collections of Tibullus and Propertius and several collections of Ovid (the &quot;Amores, Ars Amatoria, Heroides, Tristia&quot;, and &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;). The vogue of elegy during this time is seen in the so-called 3rd and 4th books of Tibullus. Many poems in these books were clearly not written by Tibullus but by others, perhaps part of a circle under Tibullus&#x27; patron Messalla. Notable in this collection are the poems of Sulpicia, thought to be the only surviving work by a Classical Latin female poet. The six elegiac poems of Lygdamus in the collection are thought by some to be an anonymous early work by Ovid, though other scholars attribute them to an imitator of Ovid who may have lived in a much later period.

Through these poets—and in comparison with the earlier Catullus—it is possible to trace specific characteristics and evolutionary patterns in the Roman form of the verse:

*The Roman authors often write about their own love affairs. In contrast to their Greek originals, these poets are characters in his own stories, and write about love in a highly subjective way.
*The form began to be applied to new themes beyond the traditional love, loss, and other &quot;strong emotion&quot; verse. Propertius uses it to relate aetiological or &quot;origin&quot; myths such as the origins of Rome (IV.1) and the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill (IV.6). Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;—though at first glance fictitious love letters—are described by Ovid himself as a new literary form, and can be read as character studies of famous heroines from mythology. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; is a lengthy elegiac poem on the first six months of the Roman calendar.
*The Romans adopted the Alexandrine habit of concealing the name of their beloved in the poem with a pseudonym. Catullus&#x27; Lesbia is notorious as the pseudonym of Clodia. But as the form developed, this habit becomes more artificial; Tibullus&#x27; Delia and Propertius&#x27; Cynthia, while likely real people, lack something of the specificity seen in Lesbia, while Ovid&#x27;s Corinna is often considered a mere literary device.
*The poets become extremely strict with pentameters. For example:
:*There is a trend toward the clear separation of the pentameter halves. Catullus, for example, allows an elision across the caesura in 18 cases, a rare occurrence in the later poets (Ovid, for example, never does this).
:*The pentameter begins to show a semi-regular &quot;leonine&quot; rhyme between the two halves of the verse, e.g. Tib. I.1–2, where the &quot;culti&quot; ending the first half of the pentameter rhymes with the &quot;soli&quot; closing the verse:
:::
:::&quot;Let another man pile up riches for himself with yellow gold
:::and hold many acres of cultivated land&quot;
::While Catullus shows this rhyme in about 1 in 5 couplets, the later elegists use it more frequently. Propertius II.34, for example, has the rhyme in nearly half its pentameters. Rhyming between adjacent lines and even in the two halves of the hexameter is also observed, more than would be expected by chance alone.
:*Unlike Catullus, later poets show a definite trend toward ending the pentameter with a two-syllable word. In Catullus the proportion of disyllabic endings is 39%, not dissimilar to Greek practice; in Propertius book 1, this rises to 61%; but in the last two books endings other than a disyllabic word are very rare. In Tibullus book 1 the figure is 93%. Ovid has no exceptions to the disyllabic ending in his &quot;Amores&quot;, and only a few exceptions in his later work.
*The hexameter follows the usual rhetorical trends of the dactylic hexameter in this age. If anything, the elegists are even more interested in verbal effects like alliteration and assonance.
*Overall there is a tendency to make the elegiac couplet increasingly dactylic. In Catullus the proportion of dactylic feet (not counting the verse endings, which do not vary) is about 37%; this rises to 45% in Propertius books 2 and 3; and in Ovid&#x27;s it rises as high as 57%.

==Post-Augustan writers==
Although no classical poet wrote collections of love elegies after Ovid, the verse retained its popularity as a vehicle for popular occasional poetry. Elegiac verses appear, for example, in Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;, and Martial&#x27;s Epigrams uses it for many witty stand-alone couplets and for longer pieces. The trend continues through the remainder of the empire; short elegies appear in Apuleius&#x27;s story of Cupid and Psyche and in the minor writings of Ausonius.

==Medieval elegy==
After the fall of the empire, one writer who produced elegiac verse was Maximianus. Various Christian writers also adopted the form; Venantius Fortunatus wrote some of his hymns in the meter, while later Alcuin and the Venerable Bede dabbled in the verse. The form also remained popular among the educated classes for gravestone epitaphs; many such epitaphs can be found in European cathedrals.

&quot;De tribus puellis&quot; is an example of a Latin &quot;fabliau&quot;, a genre of comedy which employed elegiac couplets in imitation of Ovid. The medieval theorist John of Garland wrote that &quot;all comedy is elegy, but the reverse is not true.&quot; Medieval Latin had a developed comedic genre known as elegiac comedy. Sometimes narrative, sometimes dramatic, it deviated from ancient practice because, as Ian Thompson writes, &quot;no ancient drama would ever have been written in elegiacs.&quot;

==Renaissance and modern period==
With the Renaissance, more skilled writers interested in the revival of Roman culture attempted to recapture the spirit of the Augustan writers. The Dutch Latinist Johannes Secundus, for example, included Catullus-inspired love elegies in his &quot;Liber Basiorum&quot;, while the English poet John Milton wrote several lengthy elegies throughout his career. This trend continued down through the Recent Latin writers, whose close study of their Augustan counterparts reflects their general attempts to apply the cultural and literary forms of the ancient world to contemporary themes.

<text>An era is a span of time defined for the purposes of chronology or historiography, as in the regnal eras in the history of a given monarchy, a calendar era used for a given calendar, or the geological eras defined for the history of Earth.

Comparable terms are Epoch, age, period, saeculum, aeon (Greek &quot;aion&quot;) and Sanskrit yuga.

==Etymology==
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from Late Latin &quot;aera&quot; &quot;an era or epoch from which time is reckoned,&quot; probably identical to Latin &quot;æra&quot; &quot;counters used for calculation,&quot; plural of &quot;æs&quot; &quot;brass, money&quot;.

The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century Visigothic Spain, where it appears in the &quot;History&quot; of Isidore of Seville, and in later texts. The Spanish era is calculated from 38 BC, Before Christ, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. indiction) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the Battle of Actium, which occurred in 31 BC.

Like epoch, &quot;era&quot; in English originally meant &quot;the starting point of an age&quot;; the meaning &quot;system of chronological notation&quot; is c. 1646; that of &quot;historical period&quot; is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In chronology, an &quot;era&quot; is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of time. A &quot;calendar era&quot; indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific reference date (epoch), which often marks the origin of a political state or cosmology, dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in &quot;Victorian era&quot;.

===Geological era===

In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where &quot;geologic era&quot; refers to well-defined time spans.
The next-larger division of geologic time is the eon. The Phanerozoic Eon, for example, is subdivided into eras. There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for &quot;before present&quot;).

The older Proterozoic and Archean eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the history of the universe, the term &quot;epoch&quot; is typically preferred, but &quot;era&quot; is used e.g. of the &quot;Stelliferous Era&quot;.

===Calendar eras===

Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. &quot;Anno mundi&quot; (year of the world) refers to a group of calendar eras based on a calculation of the age of the world, assuming it was created as described in the Book of Genesis. In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many Eastern Orthodox religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012. In the Western church, &quot;Anno Domini&quot; (&quot;AD&quot; also written &quot;CE&quot;), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant.

The Islamic calendar, which also has variants, counts years from the Hijra or emigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, which occurred in 622 AD. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH (&quot;After Hijra&quot;).

For a time ranging from 1872 to the Second World War, the Japanese used the imperial year system (&quot;kōki&quot;), counting from the year when the legendary Emperor Jimmu founded Japan, which occurred in 660 BC.

Many Buddhist calendars count from the death of the Buddha, which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545–543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as &quot;BE&quot; for &quot;Buddhist Era&quot;; 2000 AD was 2543 BE in the Thai solar calendar.

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the Seleucid era and the Ancient Roman &quot;ab urbe condita&quot; (&quot;AUC&quot;), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===

The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again. The use of regnal years is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures. Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of Romulus and Remus). In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.

In East Asia, each emperor&#x27;s reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*Chinese eras
*Japanese era
*Korean eras
*Vietnamese eras

A similar practice survived in the United Kingdom until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but Acts of Parliament were dated according to the years of the reign of the current monarch, so that &quot;61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37&quot; refers to the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 passed in the session of Parliament in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of Queen Victoria.

===Historiography===
&quot;Era&quot; can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the Roman era, Elizabethan era, Victorian era, etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include Soviet era, and &quot;musical eras&quot; in the history of modern popular music, such as the &quot;big band era&quot;, &quot;disco era&quot;, etc.

<doc id="9760" wikidata="Q170337" url="?curid=9760" title="Eschatology">
<text>Eschatology (; ) concerns expectations of the end of present age, human history, or the world itself. The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions (both Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic), which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as apocalypticism, and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by doomsday cults. In the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the divine. Many religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore, while other religions may have concepts of renewal or transformation after significant events. The explicit description of a new earth is primarily found in Christian teachings (this description can be found in Chapter 21 of the Book of Revelation).

The Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In Judaism, the term &quot;end of days&quot; makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Christianity depicts the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. In later traditions of Islam, separate hadiths detail the Day of Judgment is preceded by the appearance of the Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, and followed by the descending of ʿĪsā (Jesus), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the Qiyāmah (Judgment Day).

Dharmic religions tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by decay, redemption, and rebirth (though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful). In Hinduism, the end time occurs when Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, descends atop a white horse and brings an end to the current &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In Buddhism, the Buddha predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; named Maitreya will appear and rediscover the teachings of the &quot;Buddha Dharma&quot;, and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.

Since the development of the concept of deep time in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated age of planet Earth, scientific discourse about end times has considered the ultimate fate of the universe. Theories have included the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, and Big Freeze (heat death). Social and scientific commentators also worry about global catastrophic risks and scenarios that could result in human extinction.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;eschatology&quot; arises from the Ancient Greek term (&quot;éschatos&quot;), meaning &quot;last&quot;, and &quot;-logy&quot;, meaning &quot;the study of&quot;, and first appeared in English around 1844. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines eschatology as &quot;the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind&quot;.

==Linear cosmology==

=== Judaism ===

The main tenets of modern Jewish eschatology, in no particular order, include:
* God will redeem Israel from the captivity that began during the Babylonian Exile in a new Exodus.
* God will return the Jewish people to the Land of Israel.
* God will restore the House of David and the Temple in Jerusalem.
* God will raise up a regent from the House of David, the Jewish Messiah, to lead the Jewish people and the world and to usher in an age of justice and peace, the Messianic Age.
* Non-Jews will recognize that the God of Israel is the only true god.
* God will resurrect the dead.
* God will create a new heaven and earth.

Judaism usually refers to the end times as the &quot;end of days&quot; (&quot;aḥarit ha-yamim&quot;, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. The end times are addressed in the Book of Daniel and in numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the Talmud, particularly Tractate Avodah Zarah.

The idea of a Messianic Age, an era of global peace and knowledge of the Creator, has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days. A well-known passage from the Book of Isaiah describes this future condition of the world: &quot;They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare&quot; (Isaiah 2:4, see also Micah 4:3). Maimonides (1135–1204) further describes the Messianic Era in the Mishneh Torah: &quot;And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust. The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God;... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator&#x27;s wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): &#x27;For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.&#x27;&quot;

====Kabbalah====

In Kabbalah, the Zohar maintains that the seven days of the week, based on the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation. The seventh day of the week, the Shabbat day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal rest, or the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium begins with the year 6000 AM, and is the latest time the Messiah can come. A number of early and late Jewish scholars have written in support of this, including the Ramban, Isaac Abarbanel, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bachya, the Vilna Gaon, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Ramchal, Aryeh Kaplan and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis.

===Zoroastrianism===
Frashokereti is the Zoroastrian doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God (Ahura Mazda). The doctrinal premises are:
# Good will eventually prevail over evil.
# Creation, initially perfectly good, was subsequently corrupted by evil.
# The world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation.
# The &quot;salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person&#x27;s] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this&quot;. Thus each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.

Zoroastrian eschatology is considered one of the oldest in recorded history. The birth of its founder, Zoroaster, is unknown, with scholarly dates ranging from 500 BCE to 1,500 BCE. Pliny the Elder even suggests there were two Zoroasters. However, with beliefs paralleling and possibly predating the framework of the major Abrahamic faiths, a fully developed concept of the end of the world was not established in Zoroastrianism until 500 BCE. The Bahman Yasht describes:
At the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield the seed. And men become more deceitful and more given to vile practices. They will have no gratitude. Honorable wealth will proceed to those of perverted faith. And a dark cloud makes the whole sky night, and it will rain more noxious creatures than water.

A battle between the righteous and wicked will be followed by the Frashokereti. On earth, the Saoshyant will arrive as the final savior of mankind, and bring about the resurrection of the dead. The &quot;yazata&quot;s Airyaman and Atar will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, which will flow as lava across the earth and all mankind, both the living and resurrected, will be required to wade through it. &quot;Ashavan&quot; will pass through the molten river as if it were warm milk, but the sinful will burn. It will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate Angra Mainyu and the last vestiges of wickedness.

The righteous will partake of the &quot;parahaoma&quot;, which will confer immortality upon them. Humanity will become like the Amesha Spentas, living without food, hunger, thirst, weapons or injury. Bodies will become so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language, and belong to a single nation with no borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with Ahura Mazda for a perpetual and divine exaltation.

===Gnosticism===
The Gnostic codex On the Origin of the World (possibly dating from near the end of the third century AD) states that during what is called the consummation of the age, the Sun and Moon will become dark as the stars change their ordinary course. Kings will make war with each other, and thunder will cause the world to be shaken. The corrupt Archons will mourn. The sea will be troubled by fighting of the kings who became drunk from the flaming sword. Finally, great thunder will come from Sophia, the woman in the firmament above the forces of Chaos. She will cast the corrupt gods into the abyss where they will fight each other until only their chief Yaldabaoth remains and destroys himself. Next the heavens of the Archons will collapse on each other before the Earth sinks into the abyss. Light will cover the darkness and eliminate it then form into something greater than anything that ever existed before. The source of the darkness will dissolve, and the deficiency will be taken from its root. Those who were not perfected in the unconceived one will receive glories in their realms and kingdoms of the immortals, but those who were will enter a kingless realm. All will be judged according to their deeds and gnosis.

===Christianity===


Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and of the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testaments.

Christian eschatological research looks to study and discuss matters such as the nature of the divine and the divine nature of Jesus Christ, death and the afterlife, Heaven and Hell, the Second Coming of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the rapture, the Tribulation, millennialism, the end of the world, the Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New Earth in the world to come.

Eschatological passages occur in many places in the Bible, in both the Old and the New Testaments. In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in Isaiah 24–27, Isaiah 56–66, Joel, Zechariah 9–14 as well as in the closing chapters of Daniel, and in Ezekiel. In the New Testament, applicable passages include Matthew 24, Mark 13, the parable of &quot;The Sheep and the Goats&quot; and the Book of Revelation—Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

The Second Coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the Kingdom of God. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ&#x27;s return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.

The Book of Revelation stands at the core of much of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics:
* The Futurist approach treats the Book of Revelation mostly as unfulfilled prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future.
* The Preterist approach interprets Revelation chiefly as having had prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally in the events of the first century CE.
* The Historicist approach places Revelation within the context of history, identifying figures and passages in Revelation with major historical people and events. This view was commonly held by the early Christian church, then among the predecessors to Protestantism, such as John Wycliffe, Joachim of Fiore and later by the majority of Protestant Reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Wesley. Further supporters of this view included Isaac Newton (1642–1727), among others.
* The Idealist approach sees the events of Revelation as neither past nor future actualities, but as purely symbolic accounts, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.

====Date====

First-century Christians believed Jesus would return during their lifetime. When the converts of Paul in Thessalonica were persecuted by the Roman Empire, they believed the end of days to be imminent. Most of the scholars participating in the third quest hold that Jesus was an eschatological prophet who believed the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; was coming within his own lifetime or within the lifetime of his contemporaries. This view, generally known as &quot;consistent eschatology,&quot; was influential during the early to the mid—twentieth century and continues to be influential today in proposed portraits of the Historical Jesus. However, C. H. Dodd and others have insisted on a &quot;realized eschatology&quot; that says Jesus&#x27; own ministry fulfilled prophetic hopes. Many conservative scholars have adopted the paradoxical position the Kingdom of God passages describes a kingdom that is both &quot;present&quot; and &quot;still to come&quot; claiming Pauline eschatology as support. R. T. France and N. T. Wright among others have taken Jesus&#x27; apocalyptic statements of an imminent end, historically, as referring to the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD. A number of interpretations of the term &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; have thus appeared in its eschatological context, e.g., apocalyptic, realized or Inaugurated eschatologies, yet no consensus has emerged among scholars.

While some who believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist the prediction of dates or times is futile, others believe Jesus foretold signs of the end of days. The precise time, however, will come like a &quot;thief in the night&quot; (). They may also refer to in which Jesus is quoted as saying:

====Great Tribulation====
In the New Testament, Jesus refers to this period preceding the end times as the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; (), &quot;Affliction&quot; (), and &quot;days of vengeance&quot; ().

The Book of Matthew describes the devastation:
The resulting chaos will affect pregnancies, newborns, and a scourge will spread throughout the flesh, save for the elect. The vivid imagery of this section is repeated closely in .

The Gospel of Luke describes a complete unraveling of the social fabric, with widespread calamity and war:
In the Book of Revelation, the &quot;great tribulation&quot; (Rev. 7:14b) refers to a time of affliction upon God&#x27;s people.

====Catholicism====
The Profession of Faith addresses Catholic beliefs concerning the last days. Catholicism adheres to the amillennial school of thought, promoted by Augustine of Hippo in his work &quot;The City of God&quot;.

====Protestantism====
Contemporary use of the term &quot;End Times&quot; has evolved from literal belief in Christian millennialism. In this tradition, Biblical apocalypse is believed to be imminent, with various current events as omens of impending Armageddon. These beliefs have been put forward by the Adventist movement (Millerites) and dispensational premillennialists. In 1918 a group of eight, well-known preachers produced the London Manifesto, warning of an imminent second coming of Christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British.

=====Millennialists and Amillennialists=====


Protestants are divided between Millennialists and Amillennialists. Millennialists concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the Great Tribulation or be removed from it by what is referred to as a Pre-Tribulation rapture.

Amillennialists believe the end times encompass the time from Christ&#x27;s ascension to the last day, and maintain that the mention of the &quot;thousand years&quot; in the Book of Revelation is meant to be taken metaphorically (i.e., not literally), a view which continues to cause divisions within Protestant Christianity.

There is a range of eschatological belief in Protestant Christianity. Christian premillennialists who believe the end times are occurring now, are usually specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, Israel, the European Union, or the United Nations are seen as major players whose roles were foretold in scripture. Within dispensational premillennialist writing, there is the belief that Christians will be summoned to Heaven by Christ at the rapture, occurring before a Great Tribulation prophesied in Matthew 24–25; Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Tribulation is described in the Book of Revelation.

&quot;End times&quot; may also refer to the passing of an age or long period in the relationship between man and God. Adherents to this view cite the Second Epistle to Timothy and draw analogies to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Post-Exilic Hebrew books of prophecy such as Daniel and Ezekiel are given new interpretations in this Christian tradition, while apocalyptic forecasts appear in the Judeo-Christian Sibylline Oracles which include the Book of Revelation ascribed to John, the apocryphal Apocalypse of Peter, and the Second Book of Esdras.

=====Adventists and Millerites=====
Religious movements which expect that the second coming of Christ will be a cataclysmic event are generally called adventism. These have arisen throughout the Christian era, but were particularly common after the Protestant Reformation. Emanuel Swedenborg considered the second coming to be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757. Along with others, he developed a religious system around the second coming of Christ, disclosed by new prophecy or special revelation not described in the Bible. The Millerites are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for predicting the second coming.

The difference between the 19th-century Millerite and adventist movements and contemporary prophecy is that William Miller and his followers, based on biblical interpretation, predicted the time of the Second Coming to have occurred in 1844. Contemporary writing of end time has suggested the timetable will be triggered by future wars and moral catastrophe, and that this time of tribulation is close at hand.

Seventh-day Adventists believe biblical prophecy to foretell an end time scenario in which the United States works in conjunction with the Catholic Church to mandate worship on a day other than the true Sabbath, Saturday, as prescribed in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8–11). This will bring about a situation where one must choose for or against the Bible as the will of God.

=====Preterists=====

Another view of the &quot;end times&quot; is preterism. It distinguishes &quot;the time of the end&quot; from &quot;the end of time&quot;. Preterists believe the term &quot;last days&quot; (or &quot;Time of the End&quot;) refers to, neither the last days of the Earth, nor the last days of humankind, but the end of the Old Covenant between God and Israel; which, according to preterism, took place when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE.

Preterists believe that prophecies—such as the Second Coming, the desecration of the Jewish Temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, the rise of the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, the advent of The Day of the Lord, and a Final Judgment—had been fulfilled when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and completely destroyed its Temple.

Proponents of &quot;full preterism&quot; do not believe in a coming resurrection of the dead. They place this event (as well as the Second Coming) in the year 70. Advocates of partial preterism do believe in a coming resurrection. Full preterists contend that partial preterists are merely &quot;futurists&quot;, since they believe the Second Coming, the Resurrection, the Rapture, and the Judgment are yet to come.

Many preterists believe first-century Christians experienced the Rapture to rejoin the Christ.

According with Preterism&#x27;s interpretation of end times, many &quot;time passages&quot; in the New Testament foretell a Second Coming of Christ, with last days to take place within the lifetimes of his disciples: Matt. 10:23, Matt. 16:28, Matt. 24:34, Matt. 26:64, Rom. 13:11–12, 1 Cor. 7:29–31, 1 Cor. 10:11, Phil. 4:5, James 5:8–9, 1 Pet. 4:7, 1 Jn. 2:18.

=====Dispensationalists=====

Dispensationalism is an evangelical futurist Biblical interpretation that foresees a series of dispensations, or periods, in which God relates to human beings under different Biblical covenants. The belief system is primarily rooted in the writings of John Nelson Darby and is premillennial in content. The reestablishment of Israel in 1948 provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. The wars of Israel after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further support, according to John F. Walvoord. After the Six-Day War in 1967, and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, it seemed plausible to many Fundamentalist Christians in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of Armageddon.

Members of the dispensationalist movement such as Hal Lindsey, J. Dwight Pentecost, John Walvoord, all of whom have Dallas Theological Seminary backgrounds, and some other writers, claimed further that the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, would become a United States of Europe, which would in turn become a Revived Roman Empire ruled by the Antichrist. The Revived Roman Empire also figured into the New Testament writers&#x27; vision of the future. The fact that in the early 1970s, there were (erroneously thought to be) seven nations in the European Economic Community was held to be significant; this aligned the Community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in Revelation. This specific prophecy has required revision, but the idea of a Revived Roman Empire remains.

Dispensationalism, in contrast to the Millerite Adventist movement, had its beginning in the 19th century, when John Nelson Darby, founder of the Plymouth Brethren religious denomination, incorporated into his system of Biblical interpretation a system of organizing Biblical time into a number of discrete dispensations, each of which marks a separate covenant with God. Darby&#x27;s beliefs were widely publicized in Cyrus I. Scofield&#x27;s &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot;, an annotated Bible that became popular in the United States.

Since the majority of the Biblical prophets were writing at a time when the Temple in Jerusalem was still functioning, they wrote as if it would still be standing during the prophesied events. According to preterism, this was a fulfillment of the prophecies. However, according to Futurists, their destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable on hold. Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the reconstruction of the Temple before the Second Coming could occur.

====Posttribulation premillennialism====
A view of the Second Coming of Christ as held by posttribulational premillennialists holds that the Church of Christ will have to undergo great persecution by being present during the great tribulation.

====Specific prophetic movements====

In 1843, William Miller made the first of several predictions that the world would end in only a few months. As his predictions did not come true (referred to as the Great Disappointment), followers of Miller went on to found separate groups, the most successful of which is the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Members of the Baháʼí Faith believe Miller&#x27;s interpretation of signs and dates of the coming of Jesus were, for the most part, correct. They believe the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the coming of Christ came through a forerunner of their own religion, the Báb. According to the Báb&#x27;s words, 4 April 1844 was &quot;the first day that the Spirit descended&quot; into his heart. His subsequent declaration to Mullá Husayn-i Bushru&#x27;i that he was the &quot;Promised One&quot;—an event now commemorated by Baháʼís as a major holy day—took place on 23 May 1844. It was in October of that year that the Báb embarked on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he openly declared his claims to the Sharif of Mecca. The first news coverage of these events in the West was in 1845 by &quot;The Times&quot;, followed by others in 1850 in the United States. The first Baháʼí to come to America was in 1892. Several Baháʼí books and pamphlets make mention of the Millerites, the prophecies used by Miller and the Great Disappointment, most notably William Sears&#x27;s &quot;Thief in the Night&quot;.

====Restorationism (Christian primitivism)====
End times theology is also significant to restorationist Christian religions, which consider themselves distinct from both Catholicism and Protestantism.

=====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses=====
The eschatology of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is central to their religious beliefs. They believe Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in the Bible) and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God&#x27;s selection of the Bible Students associated with Charles Taze Russell as his people in 1919. They also believe that the destruction of those who reject the Bible&#x27;s message and thus willfully refuse to obey God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.

The religion&#x27;s doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918 and 1925 made in the Watch Tower Society&#x27;s publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the &quot;last days&quot;, the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned. In 1922 the society&#x27;s principal magazine, &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, described its chronology as &quot;no stronger than its weakest link&quot;, but also claimed the chronological relationships to be &quot;of divine origin and divinely corroborated... in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct&quot; and &quot;indisputable facts&quot;, and repudiation of Russell&#x27;s teachings was described as &quot;equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord&quot;.

The Watch Tower Society has acknowledged its early leaders promoted &quot;incomplete, even inaccurate concepts&quot;. The Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. It says that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower Society literature often cites Proverbs 4:18, &quot;The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established&quot; (NWT) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during &quot;the time of the end&quot;, and that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower Society publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God&#x27;s Kingdom and that they do not call their core beliefs into question.

=====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints=====
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe there will be a Second Coming of Jesus to the earth at some time in the future. The LDS Church and its leaders do not make any predictions of the date of the Second Coming.

According to church doctrine, the true gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming. They also believe there will be increasing war, earthquakes, hurricanes, and man-made disasters prior to the Second Coming. Disasters of all kind will happen before Christ comes. Upon the return of Jesus Christ, all people will be resurrected, the righteous in a first resurrection and the unrighteous in a second, later resurrection. Christ shall reign for a period of 1000 years, after which the Final Judgment will occur.

====Realized eschatology====
Realized eschatology is a Christian eschatological theory that holds that the eschatological passages in the New Testament do not refer to the future, but instead refer to the ministry of Jesus and his lasting legacy.

===Islam===

Muslims believe there are three periods before the Day of Judgment with some debate as to whether the periods could overlap.

====Sunni====
Sunnis believe the dead will then stand in a grand assembly, awaiting a scroll detailing their righteous deeds, sinful acts and ultimate judgment. Muhammad will be the first to be resurrected. Punishments will include &quot;adhab&quot;, or severe pain and embarrassment, and &quot;khizy&quot; or shame. There will also be a punishment of the grave between death and the resurrection. Several Sunni scholars explain some of the signs metaphorically.
The signs of the coming end time are divided into major and minor signs:
Following the second period, the third is said to be marked by the ten major signs known as &quot;alamatu&#x27;s-sa&#x27;ah al- kubra&quot; (The major signs of the end). They are as follows:

# A huge black cloud of smoke (dukhan) will cover the earth.
# Three sinkings of the earth, one in the East.
# One sinking of the earth in the West.
# One sinking of the earth in Arabia.
# The false messiah—anti-Christ, Masih ad-Dajjal—shall appear with great powers as a one-eyed man with his right eye blind and deformed like a grape. Although believers will not be deceived, he will claim to be God, to hold the keys to heaven and hell, and will lead many astray. In reality, his heaven is hell, and his hell is heaven. The Dajjal will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan wearing Persian shawls.
# The return of Isa (Jesus), from the fourth sky, to kill Dajjal.
# &quot;Ya&#x27;jooj&quot; and &quot;Ma&#x27;jooj&quot; (Gog and Magog), a Japhetic tribe of vicious beings who had been imprisoned by Dhul-Qarnayn, will break out. They will ravage the earth, drink all the water of Lake Tiberias, and kill all believers in their way. Isa, Imam Al-Mahdi, and the believers with them will go to the top of a mountain and pray for the destruction of Gog and Magog. God eventually will send disease and worms to wipe them out.
# The sun will rise from the West.
# The &quot;Dabbat al-ard&quot;, or Beast of the Earth, will come out of the ground to talk to people.
# The second blow of the trumpet will be sounded, the dead will return to life, and a fire will come out of Yemen that shall gather all to Mahshar Al Qiy&#x27;amah (The Gathering for Judgment).

====Shia====
Many of the signs shown above are shared by both Sunni and Shia beliefs, with some exceptions, e.g. Imam Al-Mahdi defeating Al-Masih ad-Dajjal.

Concepts and terminology in Shia eschatology include Mi&#x27;ad, the Occultation, Al-Yamani, and Sufyani. In Twelver Shia narrations about the last days, the literature largely revolves around Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is considered by many beliefs to be the true twelfth appointed successor to Muhammad. Muhammad al-Mahdi will help mankind against the deception by the &quot;Dajjal&quot; who will try to get people in to a new world religion which is called &quot;the great deception&quot;.

====Ahmadiyya====

Ahmadiyya is considered distinct from mainstream Islam. In its writing, the present age has been witness to the evil of man and wrath of God, with war and natural disaster. Ghulam Ahmad is seen as the promised Messiah and the Mahdi, fulfilling Islamic and Biblical prophecies, as well as scriptures of other religions such as Hinduism. His teaching will establish spiritual reform and establish an age of peace. This will continue for a thousand years, and will unify mankind under one faith.

Ahmadis believe that despite harsh and strong opposition and discrimination they will eventually be triumphant and their message vindicated both by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Ahmadis also incorporate the eschatological views from other religions into their doctrine and believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmed falls into this sequence.

===Baháʼí Faith===

In the Baháʼí Faith, creation has neither a beginning nor an end; Baháʼís regard the eschatologies of other religions as symbolic. In Baháʼí belief, human time is marked by a series of progressive revelations in which successive messengers or prophets come from God. The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgment to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the &quot;heaven&quot; of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the &quot;hell&quot; of denial. In this view, the terms &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;hell&quot; become symbolic terms for a person&#x27;s spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God. In Baháʼí belief, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh (1817–1892), the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, was the Second Coming of Christ and also the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of Islam and other major religions.

The inception of the Baháʼí Faith coincides with Great Disappointment of the Millerite prophecy in 1844.

ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá taught that Armageddon would begin in 1914, but without a clear indication of its end date. Baháʼís believe that the mass martyrdom anticipated during the &quot;End Times&quot; had already passed within the historical context of the Baháʼí Faith. Baháʼís expect their faith to be eventually embraced by the masses of the world, ushering in a golden age.

===Rastafari===
Rastafari have a unique interpretation of end times, based on the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. They believe Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I to be God incarnate, the &quot;King of kings&quot; and &quot;Lord of lords&quot; mentioned in Revelation 5:5. They saw the crowning of Selassie as the second coming, and the Second Italo-Ethiopian War as fulfillment of Revelation. There is also the expectation that Selassie will return for a day of judgment and bring home the &quot;lost children of Israel&quot;, which in Rastafari refers to those taken from Africa through the slave trade. There will then be an era of peace and harmony at Mount Zion in Africa.

==Cyclic cosmology==

===Hinduism===
The Vaishnavite tradition links contemporary Hindu eschatology to the figure of Kalki, the tenth and last avatar of Vishnu. Many Hindus believe that before the age draws to a close, Kalki will reincarnate as Shiva and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe. Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

In Hindu eschatology, time is cyclic and consists of kalpas. Each lasts 4.1–8.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for Brahma, who will be alive for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. Within a &quot;kalpa&quot; there are periods of creation, preservation and decline. After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a singularity and then again will expand from that single point, as the ages continue in a religious fractal pattern.

Within the current kalpa, there are four epochs that encompass the cycle. They progress from a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total corruption. The last of the four ages is Kali Yuga (which most Hindus believe is the current time), characterized by quarrel, hypocrisy, impiety, violence and decay. The four pillars of dharma will be reduced to one, with truth being all that remains. As written in the Gita:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānirbhavati Bhārata&quot;
&quot;Abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānam sṛjāmyaham&quot;

O descendant of Bharata, whenever there is a decline of religion and an increase in irreligion, at that time I manifest My eternally perfect form in this mundane world.&lt;/poem&gt;

At this time of chaos, the final avatar, Kalki, endowed with eight superhuman faculties will appear on a white horse. Kalki will amass an army to &quot;establish righteousness upon the earth&quot; and leave &quot;the minds of the people as pure as crystal.&quot;

At the completion of Kali Yuga, the next Yuga Cycle will begin with a new Satya Yuga, in which all will once again be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma. This, in turn, will be followed by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will then repeat until the larger cycle of existence under Brahma returns to the singularity, and a new universe is born.
The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagueries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief.

===Buddhism===
There is no classic account of beginning or end
in Buddhism; Masao Abe attributes this to the absence of God.

History is embedded in the continuing process of samsara or the &quot;beginningless and endless cycles of birth-death-rebirth&quot;. Buddhists believe there is an end to things but it is not final because they are bound to be born again. However, the writers of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures establish a specific end-time account in Buddhist tradition: this describes the return of Maitreya Buddha, who would bring about an end to the world. This constitutes one of the two major branches of Buddhist eschatology, with the other being the Sermon of the Seven Suns. End time in Buddhism could also involve a cultural eschatology covering &quot;final things&quot;, which include the idea that Sakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s dharma will also come to an end.

====Maitreya====

The Buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from when he preached them, corresponding approximately to the year 4300 since he was born in 623 BCE. At this time, knowledge of dharma will be lost as well. The last of his relics will be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated. There will be a new era in which the next Buddha Maitreya will appear, but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society. This will be a period of greed, lust, poverty, ill will, violence, murder, impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity and societal collapse, and even the Buddha himself will be forgotten.

This will be followed by the coming of Maitreya when the teachings of dharma are forgotten. Maitreya was the first Bodhisattva around whom a cult developed, in approximately the third century CE.

The earliest known mention of Maitreya occurs in the Cakkavatti, or Sihanada Sutta in Digha Nikaya 26 of the Pali Canon. In it, Gautama Buddha predicted his teachings of dharma would be forgotten after 5,000 years.
The text then foretells the birth of Maitreya Buddha in the city of Ketumatī in present-day Benares, whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the former palace of King Mahāpanadā, and will become a renunciate who follows Maitreya.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya will attain &quot;bodhi&quot; in seven days, the minimum period, by virtue of his many lifetimes of preparation. Once Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the Indian city of Varanasi or Benares in present-day Uttar Pradesh. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha presides over a land of purity. For example, Amitabha presides over Sukhavati, more popularly known as the &quot;Western Paradise&quot;.
A notable teaching he will rediscover is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views. The ten virtuous deeds will replace them with the abandonment of each of these practices. Edward Conze in his &quot;Buddhist Scriptures&quot; (1959) gives an account of Maitreya:

Maitreya currently resides in Tushita, but will come to Jambudvipa when needed most as successor to the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. Maitreya will achieve complete enlightenment during his lifetime, and following this reawakening he will bring back the timeless teaching of dharma to this plane and rediscover enlightenment. The Arya Maitreya Mandala, founded in 1933 by Lama Anagarika Govinda, is based on the idea of Maitreya.

Maitreya eschatology forms the central canon of the White Lotus Society, a religious and political movement which emerged in Yuan China. It later branched into the Chinese underground criminal organization known as the Triads, which exist today as an international underground criminal network. 

Note that no description of Maitreya occurs in any other sutta in the canon, casting doubt as to the authenticity of the scripture. In addition, sermons of the Buddha normally are in response to a question, or in a specific context, but this sutta has a beginning and an ending, and its content is quite different from the others. This has led some to conclude that the whole sutta is apocryphal, or tampered with.

====Sermon of the Seven Suns====
In his &quot;Sermon of the Seven Suns&quot; in the Pali Canon, the Buddha describes the ultimate fate of the Earth in an apocalypse characterized by the consequent appearance of seven suns in the sky, each causing progressive ruin until the planet is destroyed:
The canon goes on to describe the progressive destruction of each sun. The third sun will dry the Ganges River and other rivers, whilst the fourth will cause the lakes to evaporate; the fifth will dry the oceans. Later:
The sermon completes with the Earth immersed into an extensive holocaust. The Pali Canon does not indicate when this will happen relative to Maitreya.

===Norse mythology===
Norse mythology depicts the end of days as &quot;Ragnarök&quot;, an Old Norse term translatable as &quot;twilight of the gods&quot;. It will be heralded by a devastation known as Fimbulvetr which will seize Midgard in cold and darkness. The sun and moon will disappear from the sky, and poison will fill the air. The dead will rise from the ground and there will be widespread despair.

Then there will be a battle between—on the one hand—the Gods with the Æsir, Vanir and Einherjar, led by Odin, and—on the other hand—forces of Chaos, including the fire giants and jötunn, led by Loki. In the fighting Odin will be swallowed whole by his old nemesis Fenrir. The god Freyr fights Surtr but loses. Víðarr, son of Odin, will then avenge his father by ripping Fenrir&#x27;s jaws apart and stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The serpent Jörmungandr will open its gaping maw and be met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin, will defeat the serpent, only to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing in his own death.

After this people will flee their homes as the sun blackens and the earth sinks into the sea. The stars will vanish, steam will rise, and flames will touch the heavens. This conflict will result in the deaths of most of the major Gods and forces of Chaos. Finally, Surtr will fling fire across the nine worlds. The ocean will then completely submerge Midgard.

After the , the world will resurface new and fertile, and the surviving Gods will meet. Baldr, another son of Odin, will be reborn in the new world, according to Völuspá. The two human survivors, Líf and Lífþrasir, will then repopulate this new earth.

=== Egyptian mythology ===

Egyptian texts typically treat the dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the &quot;Coffin Texts&quot; and a more explicit one in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him. Details about this eschathological prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris. Yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise in the same manner as the old.

== No end times ==
=== Taoism ===

The Taoist faith is not concerned with what came before or after life, knowing only their own being in the Tao. The philosophy is that people come and go, just like mountains, trees and stars, but Tao will go on for time immemorial.

== Analogies in science and philosophy ==
Researchers in futures studies and transhumanists investigate how the accelerating rate of scientific progress may lead to a &quot;technological singularity&quot; in the future that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history, and result in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; no longer being the dominant life form on Earth.

Occasionally the term &quot;physical eschatology&quot; is applied to the long-term predictions of astrophysics about the future of Earth and ultimate fate of the universe. In approximately 6 billion years, the Sun will turn into a red giant. Life on Earth will become impossible due to a rise in temperature long before the planet is possibly actually swallowed up by the Sun or left charred. Later, the Sun will become a white dwarf.

<doc id="9762" wikidata="Q51645" url="?curid=9762" title="Ecumenical council">
<text>An ecumenical council, also called general council, is a meeting of bishops and other church authorities to consider and rule on questions of Christian doctrine, administration, discipline, and other matters in which those entitled to vote are convoked from the whole world (&quot;oikoumene&quot;) and which secures the approbation of the whole Church.

The word &quot;ecumenical&quot; derives from the Late Latin &quot;oecumenicus&quot; &quot;general, universal&quot;, from Greek &quot;oikoumenikos&quot; &quot;from the whole world&quot;, from &quot;he oikoumene ge&quot; &quot;the inhabited world&quot; (as known to the ancient Greeks); the Greeks and their neighbors, considered as developed human society (as opposed to barbarian lands); in later use &quot;the Roman world&quot; and in the Christian sense in ecclesiastical Greek, from &quot;oikoumenos&quot;, present passive participle of &quot;oikein&quot; (&quot;inhabit&quot;), from &quot;oikos&quot; (&quot;house, habitation&quot;). The first seven ecumenical councils, recognised by both the eastern and western denominations comprising Chalcedonian Christianity, were convoked by Roman Emperors, who also enforced the decisions of those councils within the state church of the Roman Empire.

Starting with the third ecumenical council, noteworthy schisms led to non-participation by some members of what had previously been considered a single Christian Church. Thus, some parts of Christianity did not attend later councils, or attended but did not accept the results. Bishops belonging to what became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church accept seven ecumenical councils, as described below. Bishops belonging to what became known as the Church of the East participated in the first two councils. Bishops belonging to what became known as Oriental Orthodoxy participated in the first four councils, but rejected the decisions of the fourth and did not attend any subsequent ecumenical councils.

Acceptance of councils as ecumenical and authoritative varies between different Christian denominations. Disputes over Christological and other questions have led certain branches to reject some councils that others accept.

== Acceptance of councils by denomination ==
The Church of the East (accused by others of adhering to Nestorianism) accepts as ecumenical the first two councils. Oriental Orthodox Churches accept the first three.

Both the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church recognize as ecumenical the first seven councils, held from the 4th to the 9th centuries. While some Eastern Orthodox accept one later council as ecumenical (which was later repudiated by the Catholic Church), the Catholic Church continues to hold general councils of the bishops in full communion with the Pope, reckoning them as ecumenical. In all, the Catholic Church recognizes twenty-one councils as ecumenical.

The first four ecumenical councils are recognized by some Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion and Reformed Churches—though they are &quot;considered subordinate to Scripture&quot;. The Lutheran World Federation recognizes the first seven Ecumenical Councils as &quot;exercises of apostolic authority&quot; and recognizes their decisions as authoritative; while member churches are not required to accept all theological statements produced by the Federation, but only to subscribe to the most basic Lutheran historical confessional documents, most do follow this recommendation.

==Infallibility of ecumenical councils==

The doctrine of the &quot;infallibility of ecumenical councils&quot; states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as &#x27;Canons&#x27; and they often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those who refuse to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is dogmatic, but that every aspect of an ecumenical council is free of errors or impeccable.

Both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches uphold versions of this doctrine. However, the Catholic Church holds that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils meet the conditions of infallibility only when approved by the Pope, while the Eastern Orthodox Church holds that an ecumenical council is itself infallible when pronouncing on a specific matter.

Protestant churches would generally view ecumenical councils as fallible human institutions that have no more than a derived authority to the extent that they correctly expound Scripture (as most would generally consider occurred with the first four councils in regard to their dogmatic decisions).

==Council documents==

Church councils were, from the beginning, bureaucratic exercises. Written documents were circulated, speeches made and responded to, votes taken, and final documents published and distributed. A large part of what is known about the beliefs of heresies comes from the documents quoted in councils in order to be refuted, or indeed only from the deductions based on the refutations.

Most councils dealt not only with doctrinal but also with disciplinary matters, which were decided in &quot;canons&quot; (&quot;laws&quot;). Study of the canons of church councils is the foundation of the development of canon law, especially the reconciling of seemingly contradictory canons or the determination of priority between them. Canons consist of doctrinal statements and disciplinary measures—most Church councils and local synods dealt with immediate disciplinary concerns as well as major difficulties of doctrine. Eastern Orthodoxy typically views the purely doctrinal canons as dogmatic and applicable to the entire church at all times, while the disciplinary canons apply to a particular time and place and may or may not be applicable in other situations.

==Circumstances of the first ecumenical councils==
Of the seven councils recognised in whole or in part by both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church as ecumenical, all were called by a Roman emperor. The emperor gave them legal status within the entire Roman Empire. All were held in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. The bishop of Rome (self-styled as &quot;pope&quot; since the end of the fourth century) did not attend, although he sent legates to some of them.

Church councils were traditional and the ecumenical councils were a continuation of earlier councils (also known as synods) held in the Empire before Christianity was made legal. These include the Council of Jerusalem (c. 50), the Council of Rome (155), the Second Council of Rome (193), the Council of Ephesus (193), the Council of Carthage (251), the Council of Iconium (258), the Council of Antioch (264), the Councils of Arabia (246–247), the Council of Elvira (306), the Council of Carthage (311), the Synod of Neo-Caesarea (c. 314), the Council of Ancyra (314) and the Council of Arles (314).

The first seven councils recognised in both East and West as ecumenical and several others to which such recognition is refused were called by the Byzantine emperors. In the first millennium, various theological and political differences such as Nestorianism or Dyophysitism caused parts of the Church to separate after councils such as those of Ephesus and Chalcedon, but councils recognised as ecumenical continued to be held.

The Council of Hieria of 754, held at the imperial palace of that name close to Chalcedon in Anatolia, was summoned by Byzantine Emperor Constantine V and was attended by 338 bishops, who regarded it as the seventh ecumenical council. The Second Council of Nicaea, which annulled that of Hieria, was itself annulled at the synod held in 815 in Constantinople under Emperor Leo V. This synod, presided over by Patriarch Theodotus I of Constantinople, declared the Council of Hieria to be the seventh ecumenical council, but, although the Council of Hieria was called by an emperor and confirmed by another, and although it was held in the East, it later ceased to be considered ecumenical.

Similarly, the Second Council of Ephesus of 449, also held in Anatolia, was called by the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II and, though annulled by the Council of Chalcedon, was confirmed by Emperor Basiliscus, who annulled the Council of Chalcedon. This too ceased to be considered an ecumenical council.

===Catholic views on those circumstances===
The Catholic Church does not consider the validity of an ecumenical council&#x27;s teaching to be in any way dependent on where it is held or on the granting or withholding of prior authorization or legal status by any state, in line with the attitude of the 5th-century bishops who &quot;saw the definition of the church&#x27;s faith and canons as supremely their affair, with or without the leave of the Emperor&quot; and who &quot;needed no one to remind them that Synodical process pre-dated the Christianisation of the royal court by several centuries&quot;.

The Catholic Church recognizes as ecumenical various councils held later than the First Council of Ephesus (after which churches out of communion with the Holy See because of the Nestorian Schism did not participate), later than the Council of Chalcedon (after which there was no participation by churches that rejected Dyophysitism), later than the Second Council of Nicaea (after which there was no participation by the Eastern Orthodox Church), and later than the Fifth Council of the Lateran (after which groups that adhered to Protestantism did not participate).

Of the twenty-one ecumenical councils recognised by the Catholic Church, some gained recognition as ecumenical only later. Thus the Eastern First Council of Constantinople became ecumenical only when its decrees were accepted in the West also.

==List of ecumenical councils==
===First seven ecumenical councils===
In the history of Christianity, the first seven ecumenical councils, from the First Council of Nicaea (325) to the Second Council of Nicaea (787), represent an attempt to reach an orthodox consensus and to unify Christendom.

All of the original seven ecumenical councils as recognized in whole or in part were called by an emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire and all were held in the Eastern Roman Empire, a recognition denied to other councils similarly called by an Eastern Roman emperor and held in his territory, in particular the Council of Serdica (343), the Second Council of Ephesus (449) and the Council of Hieria (754), which saw themselves as ecumenical or were intended as such.
# The First Council of Nicaea (325) repudiated Arianism, declared that Christ is &quot;homoousios with the Father&quot; (of the same substance as the Father), and adopted the original Nicene Creed; addressed the Quartodeciman controversy by fixing the date of Easter; recognised authority of the sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch outside their own civil provinces and granted the see of Jerusalem a position of honour.
# The First Council of Constantinople (381) repudiated Arianism and Macedonianism, declared that Christ is &quot;born of the Father before all time&quot;, revised the Nicene Creed in regard to the Holy Spirit and water baptism.
# The Council of Ephesus (431) repudiated Nestorianism, proclaimed the Virgin Mary as the Theotokos (&quot;Birth-giver to God&quot;, &quot;God-bearer&quot;, &quot;Mother of God&quot;), repudiated Pelagianism, and reaffirmed the Nicene Creed.&quot;This and all the following councils in this list are not recognised by all of the Church of the East.&quot;
#* The Second Council of Ephesus (449) received Eutyches as orthodox based on his petition outlining his confession of faith. It also deposed Theodoret of Cyrrhus and Ibas of Edessa, and condemned Ibas&#x27;s Letter to &quot;Maris the Persian&quot; (possibly a misunderstood title, indicating as the receiver a certain Catholicus Dadyeshu, bishop of Ardashir/Ctesiphon between 421 and 456; this same letter later became one of the Three Chapters).&quot;Though originally convened as an ecumenical council, this council is not recognised as ecumenical and is denounced as a &quot;Robber Council&quot; by the Chalcedonians (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Protestants).&quot;
# The Council of Chalcedon (451) repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism, and instead adopted the Chalcedonian Creed, which described the hypostatic union of the two natures of Christ, human and divine. It accordingly reinstated those deposed in 449 including Theodoret of Cyrus restored Ibas of Edessa to his see and declared him innocent upon reading his letter. It also deposed Dioscorus of Alexandria, and elevated the bishoprics of Constantinople and Jerusalem to the status of patriarchates. This is also the last council explicitly recognised by the Anglican Communion. &lt;br&gt; &quot;This council is rejected by Oriental Orthodox churches.&quot;
#* The Third Council of Ephesus (475) ratified an encyclical of Emperor Basiliscus which repudiated the Council of Chalcedon and particularly the Tome of Leo. &lt;br&gt; &quot;This council is recognised only by Oriental Orthodox churches, but is not recognised by the Chalcedonians (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Protestants). All the following councils in this list are rejected or at least not explicitly affirmed by Oriental Orthodox churches.&quot;
# The Second Council of Constantinople (553) repudiated the Three Chapters as Nestorian, condemned Origenism, and decreed the theopaschite formula.
# The Third Council of Constantinople (680–681) repudiated monothelitism and monoenergism.
#* The Quinisext Council, also called Council in Trullo (692) addressed matters of discipline (in amendment to the 5th and 6th councils).&lt;br&gt;&quot;The ecumenical status of this council was repudiated by the Western churches.&quot;
# The Second Council of Nicaea (787) restored the veneration of icons (condemned at the Council of Hieria, 754) and repudiated iconoclasm.

===Further councils recognised as ecumenical in the Catholic Church===
As late as the 11th century, seven councils were recognised as ecumenical in the Catholic Church. Then, in the time of Pope Gregory VII (1073–1085), canonists who in the Investiture Controversy quoted the prohibition in canon 22 of the Council of Constantinople of 869–870 against laymen influencing the appointment of prelates elevated this council to the rank of ecumenical council. Only in the 16th century was recognition as ecumenical granted by Catholic scholars to the Councils of the Lateran, of Lyon and those that followed. The following is a list of further councils generally recognised as ecumenical by Catholic theologians:
# First Council of the Lateran (1123) addressed investment of bishops and the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s role therein.
# Second Council of the Lateran (1139) reaffirmed Lateran I and addressed clerical discipline (clerical celibacy, dress).
# Third Council of the Lateran (1179) restricted papal election to the cardinals, condemned simony, and introduced minimum ages for ordination (thirty for bishops).
# Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) defined transubstantiation, addressed papal primacy and clerical discipline.
# First Council of Lyon (1245) proclaimed the deposition of Emperor Frederick II and instituted a levy to support the Holy Land.
# Second Council of Lyon (1274) attempted reunion with the Eastern churches, defined teaching on purgatory, approved Franciscan and Dominican orders, a tithe to support crusades, and conclave procedures.
# Council of Vienne (1311–1312) disbanded the Knights Templar.
#*Council of Pisa (1409) attempted to solve the Great Western Schism.&lt;br&gt;&quot;The council is not numbered because it was not convened by a pope and its outcome was repudiated at Constance.&quot;
# Council of Constance (1414–1418) resolved the Great Western Schism and condemned John Hus.&lt;br&gt;&quot;The Catholic Church declared invalid the first sessions of the Council of Constance, gathered under the authority of Antipope John XXIII, which included the famous decree &quot;Haec Sancta Synodus&quot;, which marked the high-water mark of the conciliar movement of reform.&quot; Decrees of the council later annulled by Pope Sixtus IV.
#*Council of Siena (1423–1424) addressed church reform.&lt;br&gt;Not numbered as it was swiftly disbanded.
# Council of Basel, Ferrara and Florence (1431–1445) addressed church reform and reunion with the Eastern Churches but split into two parties. The fathers remaining at Basel became the apogee of conciliarism. The fathers at Florence achieved union with various Eastern Churches and temporarily with the Eastern Orthodox Church.
# Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512–1517) addressed church reform.
# Council of Trent (1545–1563, with interruptions) addressed church reform and repudiated Protestantism, defined the role and canon of Scripture and the seven sacraments, and strengthened clerical discipline and education. Considered the founding event of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Temporarily attended by Lutheran delegates.&quot;
# First Council of the Vatican (1869–1870) defined the Pope&#x27;s primacy in church governance and his infallibility, repudiated rationalism, materialism and atheism, addressed revelation, interpretation of scripture and the relationship of faith and reason.
# Second Council of the Vatican (1962–1965) addressed pastoral and disciplinary issues dealing with the Church and its relation to the modern world, including liturgy and ecumenism.

===Further councils recognised as ecumenical by some Eastern Orthodox===
Eastern Orthodox catechisms teach that there are seven ecumenical councils and there are feast days for seven ecumenical councils. Nonetheless, some Eastern Orthodox consider events like the Council of Constantinople of 879–880, that of Constantinople in 1341–1351 and that of Jerusalem in 1672 to be ecumenical:
#Council in Trullo (692) debates on ritual observance and clerical discipline in different parts of the Christian Church.
#Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox) (879–880) restored Photius to the See of Constantinople. This happened after the death of Ignatius and with papal approval.
#Fifth Council of Constantinople (1341–1351) affirmed hesychastic theology according to Gregory Palamas and condemned Barlaam of Seminara.
#Synod of Iași (1642) reviewed and amended Peter Mogila&#x27;s &quot;Expositio fidei&quot; (&quot;Statement of Faith&quot;, also known as the &quot;Orthodox Confession&quot;).
#Synod of Jerusalem (1672) defined Orthodoxy relative to Catholicism and Protestantism, defined the orthodox Biblical canon.
#Synod of Constantinople (1872) addressing with nationalism or phyletism in the unity of Orthodoxy.

It is unlikely that formal ecumenical recognition will be granted to these councils, despite the acknowledged orthodoxy of their decisions, so that seven are universally recognized among the Eastern Orthodox as ecumenical.

The 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council was sometimes referred to as a potential &quot;Eighth Ecumenical Council&quot; following debates on several issues facing Eastern Orthodoxy, however not all autocephalous churches were represented. 

==Acceptance of the councils==
Although some Protestants reject the concept of an ecumenical council establishing doctrine for the entire Christian faith, Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox all accept the authority of ecumenical councils in principle. Where they differ is in which councils they accept and what the conditions are for a council to be considered &quot;ecumenical&quot;. The relationship of the Papacy to the validity of ecumenical councils is a ground of controversy between Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox churches. The Catholic Church holds that recognition by the Pope is an essential element in qualifying a council as ecumenical; Eastern Orthodox view approval by the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) as being roughly equivalent to that of other patriarchs.
Some have held that a council is ecumenical only when all five patriarchs of the Pentarchy are represented at it. Others reject this theory in part because there were no patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem at the time of the first ecumenical council.

===Catholic Church===

Both the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches recognize seven councils in the early centuries of the church, but Catholics also recognize fourteen councils in later times called or confirmed by the Pope. At the urging of German King Sigismund, who was to become Holy Roman Emperor in 1433, the Council of Constance was convoked in 1414 by Antipope John XXIII, one of three claimants to the papal throne, and was reconvened in 1415 by the Roman Pope Gregory XII. The Council of Florence is an example of a council accepted as ecumenical in spite of being rejected by the East, as the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon are accepted in spite of being rejected respectively by the Church of the East and Oriental Orthodoxy.

The Catholic Church teaches that an ecumenical council is a gathering of the College of Bishops (of which the Bishop of Rome is an essential part) to exercise in a solemn manner its supreme and full power over the whole Church. It holds that &quot;there never is an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at least recognized as such by Peter&#x27;s successor&quot;. Its present canon law requires that an ecumenical council be convoked and presided over, either personally or through a delegate, by the Pope, who is also to decide the agenda; but the church makes no claim that all past ecumenical councils observed these present rules, declaring only that the Pope&#x27;s confirmation or at least recognition has always been required, and saying that the version of the Nicene Creed adopted at the First Council of Constantinople (381) was accepted by the Church of Rome only seventy years later, in 451.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts seven ecumenical councils, with the disputed Council in Trullo—rejected by Catholics—being incorporated into, and considered as a continuation of, the Third Council of Constantinople.

To be considered ecumenical, Orthodox accept a council that meets the condition that it was accepted by the whole church. That it was called together legally is also an important factor. A case in point is the Third Ecumenical Council, where two groups met as duly called for by the emperor, each claiming to be the legitimate council. The Emperor had called for bishops to assemble in the city of Ephesus. Theodosius did not attend but sent his representative Candidian to preside. However, Cyril managed to open the council over Candidian&#x27;s insistent demands that the bishops disperse until the delegation from Syria could arrive. Cyril was able to completely control the proceedings, completely neutralizing Candidian, who favored Cyril&#x27;s antagonist, Nestorius. When the pro-Nestorius Antiochene delegation finally arrived, they decided to convene their own council, over which Candidian presided. The proceedings of both councils were reported to the emperor, who decided ultimately to depose Cyril, Memnon and Nestorius. Nonetheless, the Orthodox accept Cyril&#x27;s group as being the legitimate council because it maintained the same teaching that the church has always taught.

Paraphrasing a rule by St Vincent of Lérins, Hasler states
Orthodox believe that councils could over-rule or even depose popes. At the Sixth Ecumenical Council, Pope Honorius and Patriarch Sergius were declared heretics. The council anathematized them and declared them tools of the devil and cast them out of the church.

It is their position that, since the Seventh Ecumenical Council, there has been no synod or council of the same scope. Local meetings of hierarchs have been called &quot;pan-Orthodox&quot;, but these have invariably been simply meetings of local hierarchs of whatever Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions are party to a specific local matter. From this point of view, there has been no fully &quot;pan-Orthodox&quot; (Ecumenical) council since 787. The use of the term &quot;pan-Orthodox&quot; is confusing to those not within Eastern Orthodoxy, and it leads to mistaken impressions that these are &quot;ersatz&quot; ecumenical councils rather than purely local councils to which nearby Orthodox hierarchs, regardless of jurisdiction, are invited.

Others, including 20th-century theologians Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos) of Naupactus, Fr. John S. Romanides, and Fr. George Metallinos (all of whom refer repeatedly to the &quot;Eighth and Ninth Ecumenical Councils&quot;), Fr. George Dragas, and the 1848 Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs (which refers explicitly to the &quot;Eighth Ecumenical Council&quot; and was signed by the patriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria as well as the Holy Synods of the first three), regard other synods beyond the Seventh Ecumenical Council as being ecumenical.
From the Eastern Orthodox perspective, a council is accepted as being ecumenical if it is accepted by the Eastern Orthodox church at large—clergy, monks and assembly of believers. Teachings from councils that purport to be ecumenical, but which lack this acceptance by the church at large, are, therefore, not considered ecumenical.

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
Oriental Orthodoxy accepts three ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople, and the Council of Ephesus. The formulation of the Chalcedonian Creed caused a schism in the Alexandrian and Syriac churches. Reconciliatory efforts between Oriental Orthodox with the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Church in the mid- and late 20th century have led to common Christological declarations. The Oriental and Eastern Churches have also been working toward reconciliation as a consequence of the ecumenical movement.

The Oriental Orthodox hold that the Dyophysite formula of two natures formulated at the Council of Chalcedon is inferior to the Miaphysite formula of &quot;One Incarnate Nature of God the Word&quot; (Byzantine Greek: &quot;Mia physis tou theou logou sarkousomene&quot;) and that the proceedings of Chalcedon themselves were motivated by imperial politics. The Alexandrian Church, the main Oriental Orthodox body, also felt unfairly underrepresented at the council following the deposition of their Pope, Dioscorus of Alexandria at the council.

===Church of the East===
The Church of the East accepts two ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople, as well as a series of their own national councils, starting with the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410 AD. It was the formulation of Mary as the Theotokos which caused a schism with the Church of the East, now divided between the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, while the Chaldean Catholic Church entered into full communion with Rome in the 16th century. Meetings between Pope John Paul II and the Assyrian Patriarch Mar Dinkha IV led to a common Christological declaration on 11 November 1994 that &quot;the humanity to which the Blessed Virgin Mary gave birth always was that of the Son of God himself&quot;. Both sides recognised the legitimacy and rightness, as expressions of the same faith, of the Assyrian Church&#x27;s liturgical invocation of Mary as &quot;the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour&quot; and the Catholic Church&#x27;s use of &quot;the Mother of God&quot; and also as &quot;the Mother of Christ&quot;.

===Protestantism===
====Lutheran Churches====
The Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative. It teaches:
====Anglican Communion====
Article XXI of the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion of Anglicanism teaches: &quot;General Councils ... when they be gathered together, forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and word of God, they may err and sometime have erred, even in things pertaining to God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.&quot;

The 19th Canon of 1571 asserted the authority of the Councils in this manner: &quot;Let preachers take care that they never teach anything ... except what is agreeable to the doctrine of the Old and New Testament, and what the Catholic Fathers and ancient Bishops have collected from the same doctrine.&quot; This remains the Church of England&#x27;s teaching on the subject. A modern version of this appeal to catholic consensus is found in the Canon Law of the Church of England and also in the liturgy published in &quot;Common Worship&quot;:

The 1559 Act of Supremacy made a distinction between the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils, which were to be used as sufficient proof that something was heresy, as opposed to those of later councils, which could only be used to that purpose if &quot;the same was declared heresy by the express and plain words of the ... canonical Scriptures&quot;. As such, the Anglican tradition accepts the first four ecumenical councils, though they &quot;considered subordinate to Scripture&quot;.

While the Councils are part of the &quot;historic formularies&quot; of Anglican tradition, it is difficult to locate an explicit reference in Anglicanism to the unconditional acceptance of all Seven Ecumenical Councils. There is little evidence of dogmatic or canonical acceptance beyond the statements of individual Anglican theologians and bishops. Anglican cleric of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship Bishop Chandler Holder Jones, SSC, explains:

He quotes William Tighe, Associate Professor of History at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, (another member of the Anglo-Catholic wing of Anglicanism):
====Methodist Churches====
Methodist theologian Charles W. Brockwell Jr wrote that the first &quot;four ecumenical councils produced and clarified the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Symbol (Nicene Creed), the most important document in Christian history after the Bible itself.&quot;

The Manual of the Church of the Nazarene, part of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement within Methodism, states &quot;Our denomination receives the creeds of the first five Christian centuries as expressions of its own faith,&quot; including the Christological doctrines formulated during the first four Ecumenical Councils.

====Other Protestant denominations====
Some, including some fundamentalist Christians, condemn the ecumenical councils for other reasons. Independency or congregationalist polity among Protestants may involve the rejection of any governmental structure or binding authority above local congregations; conformity to the decisions of these councils is therefore considered purely voluntary and the councils are to be considered binding only insofar as those doctrines are derived from the Scriptures. Many of these churches reject the idea that anyone other than the authors of Scripture can directly lead other Christians by original divine authority; after the New Testament, they assert, the doors of revelation were closed and councils can only give advice or guidance, but have no authority. They consider new doctrines not derived from the sealed canon of Scripture to be both impossible and unnecessary whether proposed by church councils or by more recent prophets. Catholic and Orthodox objections to this position point to the fact that the Canon of Scripture itself was fixed by these councils. They conclude that this would lead to a logical inconsistency of a non-authoritative body fixing a supposedly authoritative source.

===Nontrinitarian groups===
Ecumenical councils are not recognised by nontrinitarian churches such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (and other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement), Christadelphians, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Church of God (Seventh-Day), their descendants and Unitarians. They view the ecumenical councils as misguided human attempts to establish doctrine, and as attempts to define dogmas by debate rather than by revelation.

<doc id="9763" wikidata="Q44559" url="?curid=9763" title="Exoplanet">
<text>An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917 but was not then recognized as such. The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992 around a pulsar, and the first detection around a main-sequence star was in 1995. A different planet, first detected in 1988, was confirmed in 2003. In collaboration with ground-based and other space-based observatories the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to give more insight into exoplanet traits, such as their composition, environmental conditions, and potential for life.

There are many methods of detecting exoplanets. Transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy have found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone. In several cases, multiple planets have been observed around a star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars are estimated to have an &quot;Earth-sized&quot; planet in the habitable zone. Assuming there are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, it can be hypothesized that there are 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are included.

The least massive exoplanet known is Draugr (also known as PSR B1257+12 A or PSR B1257+12 b), which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive exoplanet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is HR 2562 b, about 30 times the mass of Jupiter. However, according to some definitions of a planet (based on the nuclear fusion of deuterium), it is too massive to be a planet and might be a brown dwarf. Known orbital times for exoplanets vary from less than an hour (for those closest to their star) to thousands of years. Some exoplanets are so far away from the star that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to it.

Almost all planets detected so far are within the Milky Way. However, there is evidence that extragalactic planets, exoplanets located in other galaxies, may exist. The nearest exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun.

The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star&#x27;s habitable zone (sometimes called &quot;goldilocks zone&quot;), where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life as we know it, to exist on the surface. However, the study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.

Rogue planets are those that are not in planetary systems. Such objects are generally considered in a separate category from planets, especially if they are gas giants, often counted as sub-brown dwarfs. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more.

== Definition ==

=== IAU ===
The official definition of the term &quot;planet&quot; used by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) only covers the Solar System and thus does not apply to exoplanets. The IAU Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement containing a working definition of &quot;planet&quot; in 2001 and which was modified in 2003. An &quot;exoplanet&quot; was defined by the following criteria:

This working definition was amended by the IAU&#x27;s Commission F2: Exoplanets and the Solar System in August 2018. The official working definition of an &quot;exoplanet&quot; is now as follows:

=== Alternatives ===
The IAU&#x27;s working definition is not always used. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from brown dwarfs on the basis of their formation. It is widely thought that giant planets form through core accretion, which may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold; massive planets of that sort may have already been observed. Brown dwarfs form like stars from the direct gravitational collapse of clouds of gas, and this formation mechanism also produces objects that are below the limit and can be as low as . Objects in this mass range that orbit their stars with wide separations of hundreds or thousands of astronomical units (AU) and have large star/object mass ratios likely formed as brown dwarfs; their atmospheres would likely have a composition more similar to their host star than accretion-formed planets, which would contain increased abundances of heavier elements. Most directly imaged planets as of April 2014 are massive and have wide orbits so probably represent the low-mass end of a brown dwarf formation. One study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets.

Also, the 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have a precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with a mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object. As of 2011, the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, &quot;The fact that there is no special feature around in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit&quot;. As of 2016, this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses based on a study of mass–density relationships. The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: &quot;The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity.&quot; The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass (or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses. Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core pressure is dominated by Coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure with the dividing line at around 5 Jupiter masses.

== Nomenclature ==

&lt;section begin=nomenclature /&gt;
The convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the IAU designation is formed by taking the designated or proper name of its parent star, and adding a lower case letter. Letters are given in order of each planet&#x27;s discovery around the parent star, so that the first planet discovered in a system is designated &quot;b&quot; (the parent star is considered &quot;a&quot;) and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.&lt;section end=nomenclature /&gt;

== History of detection ==
For centuries scientists, philosophers, and science fiction writers suspected that extrasolar planets existed, but there was no way of knowing whether they were real in fact, how common they were, or how similar they might be to the planets of the Solar System. Various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers.

The first evidence of a possible exoplanet, orbiting Van Maanen 2, was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. The astronomer Walter Sydney Adams, who later became director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, produced a spectrum of the star using Mount Wilson&#x27;s 60-inch telescope. He interpreted the spectrum to be of an F-type main-sequence star, but it is now thought that such a spectrum could be caused by the residue of a nearby exoplanet that had been pulverized by the gravity of the star, the resulting dust then falling onto the star.

The first suspected scientific detection of an exoplanet occurred in 1988. Shortly afterwards, the first confirmation of detection came in 1992 when Aleksander Wolszczan announced the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star 51 Pegasi. Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the radial-velocity method. In February 2018, researchers using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, combined with a planet detection technique called microlensing, found evidence of planets in a distant galaxy, stating, &quot;Some of these exoplanets are as (relatively) small as the moon, while others are as massive as Jupiter. Unlike Earth, most of the exoplanets are not tightly bound to stars, so they&#x27;re actually wandering through space or loosely orbiting between stars. We can estimate that the number of planets in this [faraway] galaxy is more than a trillion.&quot;

=== Early speculations ===

In the sixteenth century, the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun (heliocentrism), put forward the view that fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets.

In the eighteenth century, the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in the &quot;General Scholium&quot; that concludes his &quot;Principia&quot;. Making a comparison to the Sun&#x27;s planets, he wrote &quot;And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of &quot;One&quot;.&quot;

In 1938, D.Belorizky demonstrated that it was realistic to search for exo-Jupiters by using transit photometry.

In 1952, more than 40 years before the first hot Jupiter was discovered, Otto Struve wrote that there is no compelling reason that planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that Doppler spectroscopy and the transit method could detect super-Jupiters in short orbits.

=== Discredited claims ===
Claims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the binary star 70 Ophiuchi. In 1855, William Stephen Jacob at the East India Company&#x27;s Madras Observatory reported that orbital anomalies made it &quot;highly probable&quot; that there was a &quot;planetary body&quot; in this system. In the 1890s, Thomas J. J. See of the University of Chicago and the United States Naval Observatory stated that the orbital anomalies proved the existence of a dark body in the 70 Ophiuchi system with a 36-year period around one of the stars. However, Forest Ray Moulton published a paper proving that a three-body system with those orbital parameters would be highly unstable.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Peter van de Kamp of Swarthmore College made another prominent series of detection claims, this time for planets orbiting Barnard&#x27;s Star. Astronomers now generally regard all early reports of detection as erroneous.

In 1991, Andrew Lyne, M. Bailes and S. L. Shemar claimed to have discovered a pulsar planet in orbit around PSR 1829-10, using pulsar timing variations. The claim briefly received intense attention, but Lyne and his team soon retracted it.

=== Confirmed discoveries ===

As of , a total of confirmed exoplanets are listed in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, including a few that were confirmations of controversial claims from the late 1980s. The first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in 1988 by the Canadian astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia. Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei, but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts. Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet&#x27;s existence to be confirmed.

On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12. This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press. These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits. As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet may be able to be formed in their orbit.

In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying what they thought was a binary pulsar (PSR B1620−26 b), determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.

On 6 October 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, nearby G-type star 51 Pegasi. This discovery, made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery, and was recognized by a share of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy, led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star&#x27;s apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet transited in front of it.

Initially, the most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;, because theories of planetary formation had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters make up the minority of exoplanets. In 1999, Upsilon Andromedae became the first main-sequence star known to have multiple planets. Kepler-16 contains the first discovered planet that orbits a binary main-sequence star system.

On 26 February 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the &quot;Kepler&quot; Space Telescope. These exoplanets were checked using a statistical technique called &quot;verification by multiplicity&quot;. Before these results, most confirmed planets were gas giants comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they were more easily detected, but the &quot;Kepler&quot; planets are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.

On 23 July 2015, NASA announced Kepler-452b, a near-Earth-size planet orbiting the habitable zone of a G2-type star.

On 6 September 2018, NASA discovered an exoplanet about 145 light years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo. This exoplanet, Wolf 503b, is twice the size of Earth and was discovered orbiting a type of star known as an &quot;Orange Dwarf&quot;. Wolf 503b completes one orbit in as few as six days because it is very close to the star. Wolf 503b is the only exoplanet that large that can be found near the so-called small planet radius gap. The gap, sometimes called the Fulton gap, is the observation that it is unusual to find exoplanets with sizes between 1.5 and 2 times the radius of the Earth.

In January 2020, scientists announced the discovery of TOI 700 d, the first Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone detected by TESS.

=== Candidate discoveries ===
As of January 2020, NASA&#x27;s &quot;Kepler&quot; and TESS missions had identified 4374 planetary candidates yet to be confirmed, several of them being nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone, some around Sun-like stars.
In September 2020, astronomers reported evidence, for the first time, of an extragalactic planet, M51-ULS-1b, detected by eclipsing a bright X-ray source (XRS), in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51a).

== Detection methods ==
=== Direct imaging ===

Planets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore, the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme optothermal stability. All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than Jupiter) and widely separated from their parent stars.

Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, and SCExAO will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods.

=== Indirect methods ===
* Transit method
: If a planet crosses (or transits) in front of its parent star&#x27;s disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet&#x27;s orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The Kepler telescope used this method.
* Radial velocity or Doppler method
:As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system&#x27;s center of mass. Variations in the star&#x27;s radial velocity—that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth—can be detected from displacements in the star&#x27;s spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1 m/s or even somewhat less. 
* Transit timing variation (TTV) 
:When multiple planets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others&#x27; orbits. Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit. For example, variations in the transits of the planet Kepler-19b suggest the existence of a second planet in the system, the non-transiting Kepler-19c. 
* Transit duration variation (TDV)

:When a planet orbits multiple stars or if the planet has moons, its transit time can significantly vary per transit. Although no new planets or moons have been discovered with this method, it is used to successfully confirm many transiting circumbinary planets.
* Gravitational microlensing
:Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have a detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, the microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1–10 AU away from Sun-like stars.
* Astrometry
:Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star&#x27;s position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method was not very productive until the 2020s. It has produced only a few confirmed discoveries, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.
* Pulsar timing
:A pulsar, a small, dense remnant of a star that has exploded as a supernova, emits radio waves regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, the motion of the pulsar around the system&#x27;s center of mass alters the pulsar&#x27;s distance to Earth over time. As a result, the radio pulses from the pulsar arrive on Earth at a later or earlier time. This light travel delay due to the pulsar being physically closer or farther from Earth is known as a Roemer time delay. The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.
* Variable star timing (pulsation frequency)
:Like pulsars, there are some other types of stars which exhibit periodic activity. Deviations from periodicity can sometimes be caused by a planet orbiting it. As of 2013, a few planets have been discovered with this method.
* Reflection/emission modulations
:When a planet orbits very close to a star, it catches a considerable amount of starlight. As the planet orbits the star, the amount of light changes due to planets having phases from Earth&#x27;s viewpoint or planets glowing more from one side than the other due to temperature differences.
* Relativistic beaming
:Relativistic beaming measures the observed flux from the star due to its motion. The brightness of the star changes as the planet moves closer or further away from its host star.
* Ellipsoidal variations
:Massive planets close to their host stars can slightly deform the shape of the star. This causes the brightness of the star to slightly deviate depending on how it is rotated relative to Earth.
* Polarimetry
:With the polarimetry method, a polarized light reflected off the planet is separated from unpolarized light emitted from the star. No new planets have been discovered with this method, although a few already discovered planets have been detected with this method.
* Circumstellar disks
:Disks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Features on the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.

== Formation and evolution ==
Planets may form within a few to tens (or more) of millions of years of their star forming.
The planets of the Solar System can only be observed in their current state, but observations of different planetary systems of varying ages allows us to observe planets at different stages of evolution. Available observations range from young proto-planetary disks where planets are still forming to planetary systems of over 10 Gyr old. When planets form in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, they accrete hydrogen/helium envelopes. These envelopes cool and contract over time and, depending on the mass of the planet, some or all of the hydrogen/helium is eventually lost to space. This means that even terrestrial planets may start off with large radii if they form early enough. An example is Kepler-51b which has only about twice the mass of Earth but is almost the size of Saturn, which is a hundred times the mass of Earth. Kepler-51b is quite young at a few hundred million years old.

==Planet-hosting stars==

There is at least one planet on average per star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an &quot;Earth-sized&quot; planet in the habitable zone.

Most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the Sun, i.e. main-sequence stars of spectral categories F, G, or K. Lower-mass stars (red dwarfs, of spectral category M) are less likely to have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method. Despite this, several tens of planets around red dwarfs have been discovered by the Kepler space telescope, which uses the transit method to detect smaller planets.

Using data from Kepler, a correlation has been found between the metallicity of a star and the probability that the star hosts a giant planet, similar to the size of Jupiter. Stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets, especially giant planets, than stars with lower metallicity.

Some planets orbit one member of a binary star system, and several circumbinary planets have been discovered which orbit both members of a binary star. A few planets in triple star systems are known and one in the quadruple system Kepler-64.

== Orbital and physical parameters ==
== General features ==

=== Color and brightness ===
The apparent brightness (apparent magnitude) of a planet depends on how far away the observer is, how reflective the planet is (albedo), and how much light the planet receives from its star, which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is. So, a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with a high albedo that is far from the star.
In 2013, the color of an exoplanet was determined for the first time. The best-fit albedo measurements of HD 189733b suggest that it is deep dark blue. Later that same year, the colors of several other exoplanets were determined, including GJ 504 b which visually has a magenta color, and Kappa Andromedae b, which if seen up close would appear reddish in color. Helium planets are expected to be white or grey in appearance.

The darkest known planet in terms of geometric albedo is TrES-2b, a hot Jupiter that reflects less than 1% of the light from its star, making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint. Hot Jupiters are expected to be quite dark due to sodium and potassium in their atmospheres, but it is not known why TrES-2b is so dark—it could be due to an unknown chemical compound.

For gas giants, geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect. Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.

There is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants. So, although optical brightness is fully phase-dependent, this is not always the case in the near infrared.

Temperatures of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their stars. Lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds. At a sufficiently low temperature, water clouds form, which further increase optical albedo. At even lower temperatures, ammonia clouds form, resulting in the highest albedos at most optical and near-infrared wavelengths.

=== Magnetic field ===

In 2014, a magnetic field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one-tenth as strong as Jupiter&#x27;s.

The magnetic fields of exoplanets are thought to be detectable by their auroral radio emissions with sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes such as LOFAR, although they have yet to be found. The radio emissions could measure the rotation rate of the interior of an exoplanet, and may yield a more accurate way to measure exoplanet rotation than by examining the motion of clouds. However, the most sensitive radio search for auroral emissions, thus far, from nine exoplanets with Arecibo also did not result in any discoveries.

Earth&#x27;s magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but on massive super-Earths with high pressure, different compounds may form which do not match those created under terrestrial conditions. Compounds may form with greater viscosities and high melting temperatures, which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Forms of magnesium oxide such as MgSi3O12 could be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.

Hot Jupiters have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up (Joule heating) causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is, the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.

In August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous deuterium into a liquid metallic hydrogen form. This may help researchers better understand giant gas planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and related exoplanets, since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful magnetic fields.

Although scientists previously announced that the magnetic fields of close-in exoplanets may cause increased stellar flares and starspots on their host stars, in 2019 this claim was demonstrated to be false in the HD 189733 system. The failure to detect &quot;star-planet interactions&quot; in the well-studied HD 189733 system calls other related claims of the effect into question. A later search for radio emissions from eight exoplanets that orbit within 0.1 astronomical units of their host stars, conducted by the Arecibo radio telescope also failed to find signs of these magnetic star-planet interactions.

In 2019, the strength of the surface magnetic fields of 4 hot Jupiters were estimated and ranged between 20 and 120 gauss compared to Jupiter&#x27;s surface magnetic field of 4.3 gauss.

=== Plate tectonics ===

In 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger super-Earths with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-Earths even if the planet is dry.

If super-Earths have more than 80 times as much water as Earth, then they become ocean planets with all land completely submerged. However, if there is less water than this limit, then the deep water cycle will move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to exist.

=== Volcanism ===

Large surface temperature variations on 55 Cancri e have been attributed to possible volcanic activity releasing large clouds of dust which blanket the planet and block thermal emissions.

=== Rings ===
The star V1400 Centauri was long believed to have been occulted by an object (either a planet or brown dwarf) that is circled by a ring system much larger than Saturn&#x27;s rings. Follow-up observations found the supposed ring system could instead be a circumplanetary disk.

There is strong evidence of a ring system around HIP 41378 f, given the planet&#x27;s measured radius is too large for its mass, the radius measurement might have been affected by a ring system around the planet.

The rings of the Solar System&#x27;s gas giants are aligned with their planet&#x27;s equator. However, for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet&#x27;s orbital plane around the star. A planet&#x27;s innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet&#x27;s equator so that if the planet has a tilted rotational axis, then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.

=== Moons ===
There is evidence that moons around other planets, commonly referred to exomoons, may exist. None has been confirmed so far.

In 2012 a candidate exomoon was detected around WASP-12b via periodic light variations in the planet&#x27;s light curve. Subsequent observations found this object might actually be a trojan planet.

In December 2013, a candidate exomoon was detected in the microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-262, it was believed to be either a exomoon around a Jupiter-sized free-floating planet or a Neptune-mass planet around a red dwarf, but follow-up observations confirmed the latter scenario. 

On 3 October 2018, evidence suggesting a large exomoon orbiting Kepler-1625b was reported, and in 2021 evidence of an exomoon around Kepler-1708b was also reported. Their existence, however, remain doubtful, but follow-up observations may confirm these exomoons.

The detection of sodium in hot Jupiters such as WASP-76b, HD 189733 b or WASP-49b is likely due to a Io-like exomoon around these planets.

=== Atmospheres ===

Atmospheres have been detected around several exoplanets. The first to be observed was HD 209458 b in 2001.
As of February 2014, more than fifty transiting and five directly imaged exoplanet atmospheres have been observed, resulting in detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day–night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure. Also, an atmosphere has been detected on the non-transiting hot Jupiter Tau Boötis b.

In May 2017, glints of light from Earth, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. The technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds, including those of exoplanets.

==== Comet-like tails ====
Kepler-1520b is a small rocky planet, very close to its star, that is evaporating and leaving a trailing tail of cloud and dust like a comet. The dust could be ash erupting from volcanos and escaping due to the small planet&#x27;s low surface-gravity, or it could be from metals that are vaporized by the high temperatures of being so close to the star with the metal vapor then condensing into dust.

In June 2015, scientists reported that the atmosphere of GJ 436 b was evaporating, resulting in a giant cloud around the planet and, due to radiation from the host star, a long trailing tail long.

=== Insolation pattern ===
Tidally locked planets in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance would have their star always shining directly overhead on one spot, which would be hot with the opposite hemisphere receiving no light and being freezing cold. Such a planet could resemble an eyeball, with the hotspot being the pupil. Planets with an eccentric orbit could be locked in other resonances. 3:2 and 5:2 resonances would result in a double-eyeball pattern with hotspots in both eastern and western hemispheres. Planets with both an eccentric orbit and a tilted axis of rotation would have more complicated insolation patterns.

== Surface ==

=== Surface composition ===
Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with transmission spectroscopy. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.

=== Surface temperature ===

Measuring the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star can estimate the temperature of an exoplanet. For example, the planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220 °C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet&#x27;s usually unknown albedo, and because factors such as the greenhouse effect may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet HD 189733b has been estimated to have an average temperature of 1,205 K (932 °C) on its dayside and 973 K (700 °C) on its nightside.

== Habitability ==

As more planets are discovered, the field of exoplanetology continues to grow into a deeper study of extrasolar worlds, and will ultimately tackle the prospect of life on planets beyond the Solar System. At cosmic distances, life can only be detected if it is developed at a planetary scale and strongly modified the planetary environment, in such a way that the modifications cannot be explained by classical physico-chemical processes (out of equilibrium processes). For example, molecular oxygen () in the atmosphere of Earth is a result of photosynthesis by living plants and many kinds of microorganisms, so it can be used as an indication of life on exoplanets, although small amounts of oxygen could also be produced by non-biological means. Furthermore, a potentially habitable planet must orbit a stable star at a distance within which planetary-mass objects with sufficient atmospheric pressure can support liquid water at their surfaces.

=== Habitable zone ===
The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet&#x27;s ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out. Rocky planets with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could maintain surface water much further out than the Earth–Sun distance. Planets with larger mass have wider habitable zones because gravity reduces the water cloud column depth which reduces the greenhouse effect of water vapor, thus moving the inner edge of the habitable zone closer to the star.

Planetary rotation rate is one of the major factors determining the circulation of the atmosphere and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that reflect more and so can be habitable much closer to their star. Earth with its current atmosphere would be habitable in Venus&#x27;s orbit, if it had Venus&#x27;s slow rotation. If Venus lost its water ocean due to a runaway greenhouse effect, it is likely to have had a higher rotation rate in the past. Alternatively, Venus never had an ocean because water vapor was lost to space during its formation and could have had its slow rotation throughout its history.

Tidally locked planets (a.k.a. &quot;eyeball&quot; planets) can be habitable closer to their star than previously thought due to the effect of clouds: at high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near the substellar point that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce surface temperatures.

Planets in the habitable zones of stars with low metallicity are more habitable for complex life on land than high metallicity stars because the stellar spectrum of high metallicity stars is less likely to cause the formation of ozone thus enabling more ultraviolet rays to reach the planet&#x27;s surface.

Habitable zones have usually been defined in terms of surface temperature, however over half of Earth&#x27;s biomass is from subsurface microbes, and the temperature increases with depth, so the subsurface can be conducive for microbial life when the surface is frozen and if this is considered, the habitable zone extends much further from the star, even rogue planets could have liquid water at sufficient depths underground. In an earlier era of the universe the temperature of the cosmic microwave background would have allowed any rocky planets that existed to have liquid water on their surface regardless of their distance from a star. Jupiter-like planets might not be habitable, but they could have habitable moons.

=== Ice ages and snowball states ===

The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets are completely frozen, but planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling, then this creates more ice, but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling, creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen, this stops carbon dioxide weathering, resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a greenhouse effect which thaws the planet again. Planets with a large axial tilt are less likely to enter snowball states and can retain liquid water further from their star. Large fluctuations of axial tilt can have even more of a warming effect than a fixed large tilt. Paradoxically, planets orbiting cooler stars, such as red dwarfs, are less likely to enter snowball states because the infrared radiation emitted by cooler stars is mostly at wavelengths that are absorbed by ice which heats it up.

=== Tidal heating ===
If a planet has an eccentric orbit, then tidal heating can provide another source of energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water. Tides also circularize orbits over time, so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits. Eccentric planets further out than the habitable zone would still have frozen surfaces, but the tidal heating could create a subsurface ocean similar to Europa&#x27;s. In some planetary systems, such as in the Upsilon Andromedae system, the eccentricity of orbits is maintained or even periodically varied by perturbations from other planets in the system. Tidal heating can cause outgassing from the mantle, contributing to the formation and replenishment of an atmosphere.

=== Potentially habitable planets ===
A review in 2015 identified exoplanets Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f and Kepler-442b as the best candidates for being potentially habitable. These are at a distance of 1200, 490 and 1,120 light-years away, respectively. Of these, Kepler-186f is in similar size to Earth with its 1.2-Earth-radius measure, and it is located towards the outer edge of the habitable zone around its red dwarf star.

When looking at the nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates, Proxima Centauri b is about 4.2 light-years away. Its equilibrium temperature is estimated to be .

==== Earth-size planets ====

* In November 2013, it was estimated that 22±8% of Sun-like stars in the Milky Way galaxy may have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earths, rising to 40 billion if red dwarfs are included.
* Kepler-186f, a 1.2-Earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a red dwarf, was reported in April 2014.
*Proxima Centauri b, a planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the nearest known star to the solar system with an estimated minimum mass of 1.27 times the mass of the Earth.
* In February 2013, researchers speculated that up to 6% of small red dwarfs may have Earth-size planets. This suggests that the closest one to the Solar System could be 13 light-years away. The estimated distance increases to 21 light-years when a 95% confidence interval is used. In March 2013, a revised estimate gave an occurrence rate of 50% for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of red dwarfs.
* At 1.63 times Earth&#x27;s radius Kepler-452b is the first discovered near-Earth-size planet in the &quot;habitable zone&quot; around a G2-type Sun-like star (July 2015).

== Planetary system ==
Exoplanets are often members of planetary systems of multiple planets around a star. The planets interact with each other gravitationally and sometimes form resonant systems where the orbital periods of the planets are in integer ratios. The Kepler-223 system contains four planets in an 8:6:4:3 orbital resonance.

Some hot Jupiters orbit their stars in the opposite direction to their stars&#x27; rotation. One proposed explanation is that hot Jupiters tend to form in dense clusters, where perturbations are more common and gravitational capture of planets by neighboring stars is possible.

== Search projects ==
* ANDES – The ArmazoNes High Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph, a planet finding and planet characterisation spectrograph, is expected to be fitted onto ESO&#x27;s ELT 39.3m telescope. ANDES was formally known as HIRES, which itself was created after a merger of the consortia behind the earlier CODEX (optical high-resolution) and SIMPLE (near-infrared high-resolution) spectrograph concepts.
* CoRoT – Space telescope that found the first transiting rocky planet.
* ESPRESSO – A rocky planet-finding, and stable spectroscopic observing, spectrograph mounted on ESO&#x27;s 4 × 8.2 m VLT telescope, sited on the levelled summit of Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
* HARPS – High-precision echelle planet-finding spectrograph installed on the ESO&#x27;s 3.6m telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile.
* Kepler – Mission to look for large numbers of exoplanets using the transit method.
* TESS – To search for new exoplanets; rotating so by the end of its two-year mission it will have observed stars from all over the sky. It is expected to find at least 3,000 new exoplanets.
