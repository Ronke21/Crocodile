<text>In mathematics, specifically general topology, compactness is a property that seeks to generalize the notion of a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space. The idea is that a compact space has no &quot;punctures&quot; or &quot;missing endpoints&quot;, i.e., it includes all &quot;limiting values&quot; of points. For example, the open interval (0,1) would not be compact because it excludes the limiting values of 0 and 1, whereas the closed interval [0,1] would be compact. Similarly, the space of rational numbers formula_1 is not compact, because it has infinitely many &quot;punctures&quot; corresponding to the irrational numbers, and the space of real numbers formula_2 is not compact either, because it excludes the two limiting values formula_3 and formula_4. However, the &quot;extended&quot; real number line &quot;would&quot; be compact, since it contains both infinities. There are many ways to make this heuristic notion precise. These ways usually agree in a metric space, but may not be equivalent in other topological spaces.

One such generalization is that a topological space is &quot;sequentially&quot; compact if every infinite sequence of points sampled from the space has an infinite subsequence that converges to some point of the space. The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the closed unit interval , some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. 
For instance, some of the numbers in the sequence accumulate to 0 (while others accumulate to 1). 
Since neither 0 nor 1 are members of the open unit interval , those same sets of points would not accumulate to any point of it, so the open unit interval is not compact. Although subsets (subspaces) of Euclidean space can be compact, the entire space itself is not compact, since it is not bounded. For example, considering formula_5 (the real number line), the sequence of points has no subsequence that converges to any real number.

Compactness was formally introduced by Maurice Fréchet in 1906 to generalize the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem from spaces of geometrical points to spaces of functions. The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem and the Peano existence theorem exemplify applications of this notion of compactness to classical analysis. Following its initial introduction, various equivalent notions of compactness, including sequential compactness and limit point compactness, were developed in general metric spaces. In general topological spaces, however, these notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion — and the standard definition of the unqualified term &quot;compactness&quot; — is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of open sets that &quot;cover&quot; the space, in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of finite sets. In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds locally – that is, in a neighborhood of each point – into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many theorems are of this character.

The term compact set is sometimes used as a synonym for compact space, but also often refers to a compact subspace of a topological space.

== Historical development ==

In the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness. On the one hand, Bernard Bolzano (1817) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a limit point. 
Bolzano&#x27;s proof relied on the method of bisection: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected. 
The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts – until it closes down on the desired limit point. The full significance of Bolzano&#x27;s theorem, and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by Karl Weierstrass.

In the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for spaces of functions rather than just numbers or geometrical points. 
The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of Giulio Ascoli and Cesare Arzelà. 
The culmination of their investigations, the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of continuous functions, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a uniformly convergent sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions. The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano&#x27;s &quot;limit point&quot;. Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of integral equations, as investigated by David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt. 
For a certain class of Green&#x27;s functions coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of mean convergence – or convergence in what would later be dubbed a Hilbert space. This ultimately led to the notion of a compact operator as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. 
It was Maurice Fréchet who, in 1906, had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term &quot;compactness&quot; to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper which led to the famous 1906 thesis).

However, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the continuum, which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis. 
In 1870, Eduard Heine showed that a continuous function defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact uniformly continuous. In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. 
The significance of this lemma was recognized by Émile Borel (1895), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by Pierre Cousin (1895) and Henri Lebesgue (1904). The Heine–Borel theorem, as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.

This property was significant because it allowed for the passage from local information about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function). This sentiment was expressed by , who also exploited it in the development of the integral now bearing his name. Ultimately, the Russian school of point-set topology, under the direction of Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn, formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a topological space. showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) sequential compactness, under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers. It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.
== Basic examples ==

Any finite space is compact; a finite subcover can be obtained by selecting, for each point, an open set containing it. A nontrivial example of a compact space is the (closed) unit interval of real numbers. If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some accumulation point among these points in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to 0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to 1. The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself — an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be bounded, since in the interval , one could choose the sequence of points , of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.

In two dimensions, closed disks are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary. However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary – without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior. Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can still tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point &quot;within&quot; the space. Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.

== Definitions ==

Various definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality. 
A subset of Euclidean space in particular is called compact if it is closed and bounded. This implies, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, that any infinite sequence from the set has a subsequence that converges to a point in the set. Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces.

In contrast, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent in general topological spaces, and the most useful notion of compactness – originally called &quot;bicompactness&quot; – is defined using covers consisting of open sets (see &quot;Open cover definition&quot; below). 
That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the Heine–Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locally – in a neighbourhood of each point of the space – and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.

===Open cover definition===

Formally, a topological space is called &quot;compact&quot; if every open cover of has a finite subcover. That is, is compact if for every collection of open subsets of such that

formula_6

there is a finite subcollection ⊆ such that

formula_7

Some branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, typically influenced by the French school of Bourbaki, use the term &quot;quasi-compact&quot; for the general notion, and reserve the term &quot;compact&quot; for topological spaces that are both Hausdorff and &quot;quasi-compact&quot;. A compact set is sometimes referred to as a &quot;compactum&quot;, plural &quot;compacta&quot;.

=== Compactness of subsets ===

A subset of a topological space is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the subspace topology). That is, is compact if for every arbitrary collection of open subsets of such that

formula_8

there is a finite subcollection ⊆ such that

formula_9

Because compactness is a topological property, the compactness of a subset depends only on the subspace topology induced on it. It follows that, if formula_10, with subset equipped with the subspace topology, then is compact in if and only if is compact in .

=== Characterization ===

If is a topological space then the following are equivalent:
# is compact; i.e., every open cover of has a finite subcover.
# has a sub-base such that every cover of the space, by members of the sub-base, has a finite subcover (Alexander&#x27;s sub-base theorem).
# is Lindelöf and countably compact.
# Any collection of closed subsets of with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.
# Every net on has a convergent subnet (see the article on nets for a proof).
# Every filter on has a convergent refinement.
# Every net on has a cluster point.
# Every filter on has a cluster point.
# Every ultrafilter on converges to at least one point.
# Every infinite subset of has a complete accumulation point.
# For every topological space , the projection formula_11 is a closed mapping (see proper map).
# Every open cover linearly ordered by subset inclusion contains .

Bourbaki defines a compact space (quasi-compact space) as a topological space where each filter has a cluster point (i.e., 8. in the above).
==== Euclidean space ====

For any subset of Euclidean space, is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded; this is the Heine–Borel theorem.

As a Euclidean space is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed interval or closed -ball.

==== Metric spaces ====

For any metric space , the following are equivalent (assuming countable choice):
# is compact.
# is complete and totally bounded (this is also equivalent to compactness for uniform spaces).
# is sequentially compact; that is, every sequence in has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in (this is also equivalent to compactness for first-countable uniform spaces).
# is limit point compact (also called weakly countably compact); that is, every infinite subset of has at least one limit point in .
# is countably compact; that is, every countable open cover of has a finite subcover.
# is an image of a continuous function from the Cantor set.
# Every decreasing nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets in has a nonempty intersection.
# Every increasing nested sequence of proper open subsets in fails to cover .

A compact metric space also satisfies the following properties:
# Lebesgue&#x27;s number lemma: For every open cover of , there exists a number such that every subset of of diameter &lt; is contained in some member of the cover.
# is second-countable, separable and Lindelöf – these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.
# is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is ). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the real line equipped with the discrete metric is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all singletons of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.

==== Ordered spaces ====

For an ordered space (i.e. a totally ordered set equipped with the order topology), the following are equivalent:
# is compact.
# Every subset of has a supremum (i.e. a least upper bound) in .
# Every subset of has an infimum (i.e. a greatest lower bound) in .
# Every nonempty closed subset of has a maximum and a minimum element.

An ordered space satisfying (any one of) these conditions is called a complete lattice.

In addition, the following are equivalent for all ordered spaces , and (assuming countable choice) are true whenever is compact. (The converse in general fails if is not also metrizable.):
# Every sequence in has a subsequence that converges in .
# Every monotone increasing sequence in converges to a unique limit in .
# Every monotone decreasing sequence in converges to a unique limit in .
# Every decreasing nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets 1 ⊇ 2 ⊇ ... in has a nonempty intersection.
# Every increasing nested sequence of proper open subsets 1 ⊆ 2 ⊆ ... in fails to cover .

==== Characterization by continuous functions ====

Let be a topological space and the ring of real continuous functions on . 
For each , the evaluation map formula_12
given by is a ring homomorphism. 
The kernel of is a maximal ideal, since the residue field is the field of real numbers, by the first isomorphism theorem. A topological space is pseudocompact if and only if every maximal ideal in has residue field the real numbers. For completely regular spaces, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism. There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.

In general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals in such that the residue field is a (non-Archimedean) hyperreal field. The framework of non-standard analysis allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness: a topological space is compact if and only if every point of the natural extension is infinitely close to a point of (more precisely, is contained in the monad of ).

==== Hyperreal definition ====

A space is compact if its hyperreal extension (constructed, for example, by the ultrapower construction) has the property that every point of is infinitely close to some point of . For example, an open real interval is not compact because its hyperreal extension contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of .

== Sufficient conditions ==

* A closed subset of a compact space is compact.
* A finite union of compact sets is compact.
* A continuous image of a compact space is compact.
* The intersection of any non-empty collection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff space is compact (and closed);
** If is not Hausdorff then the intersection of two compact subsets may fail to be compact (see footnote for example).
* The product of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice.)
* In a metrizable space, a subset is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact (assuming countable choice)
* A finite set endowed with any topology is compact.

== Properties of compact spaces ==

* A compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed. 
** If is not Hausdorff then a compact subset of may fail to be a closed subset of (see footnote for example).
** If is not Hausdorff then the closure of a compact set may fail to be compact (see footnote for example).
* In any topological vector space (TVS), a compact subset is complete. However, every non-Hausdorff TVS contains compact (and thus complete) subsets that are &quot;not&quot; closed.
* If and are disjoint compact subsets of a Hausdorff space , then there exist disjoint open sets and in such that and .
* A continuous bijection from a compact space into a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
* A compact Hausdorff space is normal and regular.
* If a space is compact and Hausdorff, then no finer topology on is compact and no coarser topology on is Hausdorff.
* If a subset of a metric space is compact then it is -bounded.

=== Functions and compact spaces ===

Since a continuous image of a compact space is compact, the extreme value theorem holds for such spaces: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum. 
(Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a proper map is compact.

=== Compactifications ===
Every topological space is an open dense subspace of a compact space having at most one point more than , by the Alexandroff one-point compactification. 
By the same construction, every locally compact Hausdorff space is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than .

=== Ordered compact spaces ===

A nonempty compact subset of the real numbers has a greatest element and a least element.

Let be a simply ordered set endowed with the order topology. 
Then is compact if and only if is a complete lattice (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).

== Examples ==

* Any finite topological space, including the empty set, is compact. More generally, any space with a finite topology (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the trivial topology.
* Any space carrying the cofinite topology is compact.
* Any locally compact Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of Alexandroff one-point compactification. The one-point compactification of formula_2 is homeomorphic to the circle ; the one-point compactification of formula_14 is homeomorphic to the sphere . Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.
* The right order topology or left order topology on any bounded totally ordered set is compact. In particular, Sierpiński space is compact.
* No discrete space with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all singletons of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.
* In formula_2 carrying the lower limit topology, no uncountable set is compact.
* In the cocountable topology on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not locally compact but is still Lindelöf.
* The closed unit interval is compact. This follows from the Heine–Borel theorem. The open interval is not compact: the open cover formula_16 for does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of &quot;rational numbers&quot; in the closed interval is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals formula_17 cover all the rationals in [0, 1] for but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of formula_2.
* The set formula_2 of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals , where takes all integer values in , cover formula_2 but there is no finite subcover.
* On the other hand, the extended real number line carrying the analogous topology &quot;is&quot; compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity and thus would &quot;not&quot; cover the extended real line. In fact, the set has the homeomorphism to [−1, 1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.
* For every natural number , the -sphere is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional normed vector space is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball is compact.
* On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. (Alaoglu&#x27;s theorem)
* The Cantor set is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
* Consider the set of all functions from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on so that a sequence formula_21 in converges towards if and only if formula_22 converges towards for all real numbers . There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of pointwise convergence or the product topology. Then is a compact topological space; this follows from the Tychonoff theorem.
* A subset of the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space is relatively compact if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded (Arzelà–Ascoli theorem).
* Consider the set of all functions satisfying the Lipschitz condition for all . Consider on the metric induced by the uniform distance formula_23 Then by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem the space is compact.
* The spectrum of any bounded linear operator on a Banach space is a nonempty compact subset of the complex numbers formula_24. Conversely, any compact subset of formula_24 arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space formula_26 may have any compact nonempty subset of formula_24 as spectrum.
* The space of Borel probability measures on a compact Hausdorff space is compact for the vague topology, by the Alaoglu theorem.
* A collection of probability measures on the Borel sets of Euclidean space is called &quot;tight&quot; if, for any positive epsilon, there exists a compact subset containing all but at most epsilon of the mass of each of the measures. Helly&#x27;s theorem then asserts that a collection of probability measures is relatively compact for the vague topology if and only if it is tight.

=== Algebraic examples ===

* Topological groups such as an orthogonal group are compact, while groups such as a general linear group are not.
* Since the -adic integers are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.
* Any global field &quot;K&quot; is a discrete additive subgroup of its adele ring, and the quotient space is compact. This was used in John Tate&#x27;s thesis to allow harmonic analysis to be used in number theory.
* The spectrum of any commutative ring with the Zariski topology (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never Hausdorff (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact schemes, &quot;quasi&quot; referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.
* The spectrum of a Boolean algebra is compact, a fact which is part of the Stone representation theorem. Stone spaces, compact totally disconnected Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied. Such spaces are also useful in the study of profinite groups.
* The structure space of a commutative unital Banach algebra is a compact Hausdorff space.
* The Hilbert cube is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem.
* A profinite group (e.g. Galois group) is compact.

<text>Clodius is an alternate form of the Roman &quot;nomen&quot; Claudius, a patrician &quot;gens&quot; that was traditionally regarded as Sabine in origin. The alternation of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;au&quot; is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The feminine form is Clodia.

==Republican era==

===Publius Clodius Pulcher===

During the Late Republic, the spelling &quot;Clodius&quot; is most prominently associated with Publius Clodius Pulcher, a popularis politician who gave up his patrician status through an order in order to qualify for the office of tribune of the &quot;plebs&quot;. Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban &quot;plebs&quot;, supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (&quot;collegia&quot;); because of this individual&#x27;s ideology, &quot;Clodius&quot; has often been taken as a more &quot;plebeian&quot; spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodius&#x27;s two elder brothers, the Appius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 54 BC and the C. Claudius Pulcher who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.

The view that &quot;Clodius&quot; represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodius&#x27;s chief modern-era biographer. In &quot;The Patrician Tribune&quot;, W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodius&#x27;s sisters and that &quot;the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong.&quot; A plebeian branch of the &quot;gens&quot;, the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some inscriptional evidence that the &quot;-o-&quot; form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the &quot;patrician tribune&quot; Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of &quot;-o-&quot; by the &quot;chic&quot; Clodia was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The linguistic variation of &quot;o&quot; for &quot;au&quot; was characteristic of the Umbrian language, of which Sabine was a branch. Forms using &quot;o&quot; were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of &quot;Clodius&quot; would have been either a whimsical gesture of pastoral fantasy, or a trendy assertion of antiquarian authenticity.

===Other Clodii of the Republic===
In addition to Clodius, Clodii from the Republican era include:

* Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus, presumably a &quot;Clodius&quot; before his adoption
* Clodius Aesopus, a tragic actor in the 50s BC who may have been a freedman of one of the Clodii Pulchri.
* Claudia, daughter of Clodius Pulcher and Fulvia, the first wife of emperor Augustus.
* Clodia, sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher, sometimes identified in Catullus&#x27; poems as &quot;Lesbia&quot;.

Women of the Claudii Marcelli branch were often called &quot;Clodia&quot; in the late Republic.

==Imperial era==

People using the name &quot;Clodius&quot; during the period of the Roman Empire include:
* Gaius Clodius Licinus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 4.
* Gaius Clodius Vestalis, possible builder of the Via Clodia
* Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus, senator and philosopher during the reign of Nero
* Lucius Clodius Macer, a &quot;legatus&quot; who revolted against Nero
* Publius Clodius Quirinalis, from Arelate in Gaul, teacher of rhetoric in time of Nero
* Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus, commonly known as Clodius Albinus, rival emperor 196–197
* Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus, known as Pupienus, co-emperor 238
* Titus Clodius Pupienus Pulcher Maximus, son of emperor Pupienus and suffect consul c. 235

===Clodii Celsini===
The Clodii Celsini continued to practice the traditional religions of antiquity in the face of Christian hegemony through at least the 4th century, when Clodius Celsinus Adelphius (see below) converted. Members of this branch include:
* Quintus Fabius Clodius Agrippianus Celsinus, proconsul of Caria in 249 and the son of Clodius Celsinus (b. &quot;ca.&quot; 185); see for other members of the family.
* Clodius Celsinus Adelphius, &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in 351.
* Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius, consul 379

==See also==
* Clodio the Longhair, a chieftain of the Salian Franks, sometimes called &quot;Clodius I&quot;
*&quot;Leges Clodiae&quot;, legislation sponsored by Clodius Pulcher as tribune

<text>Marcus Tullius Cicero ( ; ; 3 January 106 BC – 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, philosopher, orator, writer and Academic skeptic, who tried to uphold optimate principles during the political crises that led to the establishment of the Roman Empire. His extensive writings include treatises on rhetoric, philosophy and politics. He is considered one of Rome&#x27;s greatest orators and prose stylists and the innovator of what became known as &quot;Ciceronian rhetoric&quot;. Cicero was educated in Rome and in Greece. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and served as consul in 63 BC.

He greatly influenced both ancient and modern reception of the Latin language. A substantial part of his work has survived, and he was admired by both ancient and modern authors alike. Cicero adapted the arguments of the chief schools of Hellenistic philosophy in Latin and coined a large portion of Latin philosophical vocabulary via lexical innovation (e.g. neologisms such as , &quot;generator&quot;, , &quot;infinitio&quot;, , ), almost 150 of which were the result of translating Greek philosophical terms.

Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the Catiline conspiracy attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero (by his own account) suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators without trial, an act which would later lead to his exile. During the chaotic middle period of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, Cicero was a supporter of the Optimates faction. Following Caesar&#x27;s death, Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC, having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head (taken by order of Antony and displayed representing the repercussions of his anti-Antonian actions as a writer and as an orator, respectively) were then displayed on the Rostra.

Petrarch&#x27;s rediscovery of Cicero&#x27;s letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance in public affairs, humanism, and classical Roman culture. According to Polish historian Tadeusz Zieliński, &quot;the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity.&quot; The peak of Cicero&#x27;s authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment, and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as John Locke, David Hume, Montesquieu, and Edmund Burke was substantial. His works rank among the most influential in global culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.

== Early life ==

Marcus Tullius Cicero was born on 3 January 106 BC in Arpinum, a hill town southeast of Rome. He belonged to the &quot;tribus&quot; Cornelia. His father was a wealthy member of the equestrian order and possessed good connections in Rome. However, being a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life and studied extensively to compensate. Little is known about Cicero&#x27;s mother Helvia, but Cicero&#x27;s brother Quintus wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.

Cicero&#x27;s cognomen, a hereditary nickname, comes from the Latin for chickpea, . Plutarch explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero&#x27;s ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. The famous family names of Fabius, Lentulus, and Piso come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make &quot;Cicero&quot; more glorious than &quot;Scaurus&quot; (&quot;Swollen-ankled&quot;) and &quot;Catulus&quot; (&quot;Puppy&quot;).

At the age of 15, in 90 BC, Cicero started serving under Pompey Strabo and later Sulla in the Social war between Rome and its Italian allies. When in Rome during the turbulent plebeian tribunate of Publius Sulpicius Rufus in 88 BC which saw a short bout of fighting between the Sulpicius and Sulla, who had been elected consul for that year, Cicero found himself greatly impressed by Sulpicius&#x27; oratory even if he disagreed with his politics. He continued his studies at Rome, writing a pamphlet titled &quot;On Invention&quot; relating to rhetorical argumentation and studying philosophy with Greek academics who had fled the ongoing First Mithridatic War.

=== Education ===
During this period in Roman history, Greek language and cultural studies were highly valued by the elite classes. Cicero was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians; as he obtained much of his understanding of the theory and practice of rhetoric from the Greek poet Archias. Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.

Cicero&#x27;s interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him providing a comprehensive account of Greek philosophy for a Roman audience, including creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin. In 87 BC, Philo of Larissa, the head of the Platonic Academy that had been founded by Plato in Athens about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, &quot;inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy&quot;, sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed Carneades&#x27; Academic Skeptic philosophy.

According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome, affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under Quintus Mucius Scaevola. Cicero&#x27;s fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, Servius Sulpicius Rufus (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and Titus Pomponius. The latter two became Cicero&#x27;s friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname &quot;Atticus&quot;, and whose sister married Cicero&#x27;s brother) would become, in Cicero&#x27;s own words, &quot;as a second brother&quot;, with both maintaining a lifelong correspondence.

In 79 BC, Cicero left for Greece, Asia Minor and Rhodes. This was perhaps to avoid the potential wrath of Sulla, as Plutarch claims, though Cicero himself says it was to hone his skills and improve his physical fitness. In Athens he studied philosophy with Antiochus of Ascalon, the &#x27;Old Academic&#x27; and initiator of Middle Platonism. In Asia Minor, he met the leading orators of the region and continued to study with them. Cicero then journeyed to Rhodes to meet his former teacher, Apollonius Molon, who had taught him in Rome. Molon helped Cicero hone the excesses in his style, as well as train his body and lungs for the demands of public speaking. Charting a middle path between the competing Attic and Asiatic styles, Cicero would ultimately become considered second only to Demosthenes among history&#x27;s orators.

== Early career ==
===Early legal activity===

While Cicero had feared that the law courts would be closed forever, they were reopened in the aftermath of Sulla&#x27;s civil war and the purging of Sulla&#x27;s political opponents in the proscriptions. Many of the orators whom Cicero had admired in his youth were now dead from age or political violence. His first major appearance in the courts was in 81 BC at the age of 26 when he delivered &quot;Pro Quinctio&quot;, a speech defending certain commercial transactions which Cicero had recorded and disseminated.

His more famous speech defending Sextus Roscius of Ameria – – on charges of parricide in 80 BC was his first appearance in criminal court. In this high-profile case, Cicero accused a freedman of the dictator Sulla, Chrysogonus, of fabricating Roscius&#x27; father&#x27;s proscription to obtain Roscius&#x27; family&#x27;s property. Successful in his defence, Cicero tactfully avoided incriminating Sulla of any wrongdoing and developed a positive oratorical reputation for himself.

While Plutarch claims that Cicero left Rome shortly thereafter out of fear of Sulla&#x27;s response, according to Kathryn Tempest, &quot;most scholars now dismiss this suggestion&quot; because Cicero left Rome after Sulla resigned his dictatorship. Cicero, for his part, later claimed that he left Rome, headed for Asia, to develop his physique and develop his oratory. After marrying his wife, Terentia, in 80 BC, he eventually left for Asia Minor with his brother Quintus, his friend Titus Atticus, and others on a long trip spanning most of 79 through 77 BC. Returning to Rome in 77 BC, Cicero again busied himself with legal defence.

===Early political career===
In 76 BC, at the quaestorian elections, Cicero was elected at the minimum age required – 30 years – in the first returns from the &quot;comitia tributa&quot;, to the post of quaestor. Ex officio, he also became a member of the Senate. In the quaestorian lot, he was assigned to Sicily for 75 BC. The post, which was largely one related to financial administration in support of the state or provincial governors, proved for Cicero an important place where he could gain clients in the provinces. His time in Sicily saw him balance his duties – largely in terms of sending more grain back to Rome – with his support for the provincials, Roman businessmen in the area, and local potentates. Adeptly balancing those responsibilities, he won their gratitude. He was also appreciated by local Syracusans for the rediscovery of the lost tomb of Archimedes, which he personally financed.

Promising to lend the Sicilians his oratorical voice, he was called on a few years after his quaestorship to prosecute the Roman province&#x27;s governor Gaius Verres, for abuse of power and corruption. In 70 BC, at the age of 36, Cicero launched his first high-profile prosecution against Verres, an emblem of the corrupt Sullan supporters who had risen in the chaos of the civil war.

The prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success for Cicero. While Verres hired the prominent lawyer, Quintus Hortensius, after a lengthy period in Sicily collecting testimonials and evidence and persuading witnesses to come forward, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortensius. On the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Hortensius was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in Rome; to beat him would guarantee much success and the prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero&#x27;s oratorical ability is shown in his character assassination of Verres and various other techniques of persuasion used on the jury. One such example is found in the speech &quot;In Verrem&quot;, where he states &quot;with you on this bench, gentlemen, with Marcus Acilius Glabrio as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve&quot;. Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media. Cicero was neither a patrician nor a plebeian noble; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.

Cicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. Sulla&#x27;s victory in the first of a series of civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla&#x27;s reforms strengthened the position of the equestrian class, contributing to that class&#x27;s growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian and a , but more importantly he was a Roman constitutionalist. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would &quot;command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes&quot;. The optimates faction never truly accepted Cicero, and this undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he successfully ascended the cursus honorum, holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: quaestor in 75 BC (age 30), aedile in 69 BC (age 36), and praetor in 66 BC (age 39), when he served as president of the extortion court. He was then elected consul at age 42.

==Consulship==

Cicero, seizing the opportunity offered by optimate fear of reform, was elected consul for the year 63 BC; he was elected with the support of every unit of the centuriate assembly, rival members of the post-Sullan establishment, and the leaders of municipalities throughout post-Social War Italy. His co-consul for the year, Gaius Antonius Hybrida, played a minor role.

He began his consular year by opposing a land bill proposed by a plebeian tribune which would have appointed commissioners with semi-permanent authority over land reform. Cicero was also active in the courts, defending Gaius Rabirius from accusations of participating in the unlawful killing of plebeian tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus in 100 BC. The prosecution occurred before the and threatened to reopen conflict between the Marian and Sullan factions at Rome. Cicero defended the use of force as being authorised by a , which would prove similar to his own use of force under such conditions.

=== Catilinarian Conspiracy ===

Most famouslyin part because of his own publicityhe thwarted a conspiracy led by Lucius Sergius Catilina to overthrow the Roman Republic with the help of foreign armed forces. Cicero procured a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; (a recommendation from the senate attempting to legitimise the use of force) and drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the Catilinarian orations), which remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style. The Orations listed Catiline and his followers&#x27; debaucheries, and denounced Catiline&#x27;s senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of Cicero&#x27;s first speech (which was made in the Temple of Jupiter Stator), Catiline hurriedly left the Senate. In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered the second and third orations before the people, and the last one again before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence, against Catiline.

Catiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while he himself assaulted the city with an army of &quot;moral and financial bankrupts, or of honest fanatics and adventurers&quot;. It is alleged that Catiline had attempted to involve the Allobroges, a tribe of Transalpine Gaul, in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters that incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess in front of the Senate. The senate then deliberated upon the conspirators&#x27; punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various legislative assemblies rather than a judicial body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile – the standard options – would not remove the threat to the state. At first Decimus Junius Silanus spoke for the &quot;extreme penalty&quot;; but during the debate many were swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. Cato the Younger then rose in defense of the death penalty and the Senate finally agreed on the matter, and came down in support of the death penalty. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the Tullianum, the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum.

Cicero received the honorific &quot;pater patriae&quot; for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy, but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial. While the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; gave some legitimacy to the use of force against the conspirators, Cicero also argued that Catiline&#x27;s conspiracy, by virtue of its treason, made the conspirators enemies of the state and forfeited the protections intrinsically possessed by Roman citizens. The consuls moved decisively. Antonius Hybrida was dispatched to defeat Catiline in battle that year, preventing Crassus or Pompey from exploiting the situation for their own political aims.

After the suppression of the conspiracy, Cicero was proud of his accomplishment. Some of his political enemies argued that though the act gained Cicero popularity, he exaggerated the extent of his success. He overestimated his popularity again several years later after being exiled from Italy and then allowed back from exile. At this time, he claimed that the republic would be restored along with him.

Shortly after completing his consulship, in late 62 BC, Cicero arranged the purchase of a large townhouse on the Palatine Hill previously owned by Rome&#x27;s richest citizen, Marcus Licinius Crassus. To finance the purchase, Cicero borrowed some two million sesterces from Publius Cornelius Sulla, whom he had previously defended from court. Cicero boasted his house was &quot;in conspectu prope totius urbis&quot; (&quot;in sight of nearly the whole city&quot;), only a short walk from the Roman Forum.

==Exile and return==
In 60 BC, Julius Caesar invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus, an assembly that would eventually be called the First Triumvirate. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic, and because he was strongly opposed to anything unconstitutional that limited the powers of the consuls and replaced them with non-elected officials.

During Caesar&#x27;s consulship of 59 BC, the triumvirate had achieved many of their goals of land reform, publicani debt forgiveness, ratification of Pompeian conquests, etc. With Caesar leaving for his provinces, they wished to maintain their hold on politics. They engineered the adoption of patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher into a plebeian family and had him elected as one of the ten tribunes of the plebs for 58 BC. Clodius used the triumvirate&#x27;s backing to push through legislation that benefited them. He introduced several laws (the &quot;leges Clodiae&quot;) that made him popular with the people, strengthening his power base, then he turned on Cicero. Clodius passed a law which made it illegal to offer &quot;fire and water&quot; (i.e. shelter or food) to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial. 
Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, was clearly the intended target. Furthermore, many believed that Clodius acted in concert with the triumvirate who feared that Cicero would seek to abolish many of Caesar&#x27;s accomplishments while consul the year before. Cicero argued that the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey.

Cicero grew out his hair, dressed in mourning and toured the streets. Clodius&#x27; gangs dogged him, hurling abuse, stones and even excrement. Hortensius, trying to rally to his old rival&#x27;s support, was almost lynched. The Senate and the consuls were cowed. Caesar, who was still encamped near Rome, was apologetic but said he could do nothing when Cicero brought himself to grovel in the proconsul&#x27;s tent. Everyone seemed to have abandoned Cicero.

After Clodius passed a law to deny to Cicero fire and water (i.e. shelter) within four hundred miles of Rome, Cicero went into exile. He arrived at Thessalonica, on 23 May 58 BC. In his absence, Clodius, who lived next door to Cicero on the Palatine, arranged for Cicero&#x27;s house to be confiscated by the state, and was even able to purchase a part of the property in order to extend his own house. After demolishing Cicero&#x27;s house, Clodius had the land consecrated and symbolically erected a temple of Liberty (&quot;aedes Libertatis&quot;) on the vacant land.

Cicero&#x27;s exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to Atticus: &quot;Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don&#x27;t blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier&quot;. After the intervention of recently elected tribune Titus Annius Milo, acting on the behalf of Pompey who wanted Cicero as a client, the Senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on 5 August 57 BC, landing at Brundisium. He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter Tullia. In his &quot;Oratio De Domo Sua Ad Pontifices&quot;, Cicero convinced the College of Pontiffs to rule that the consecration of his land was invalid, thereby allowing him to regain his property and rebuild his house on the Palatine.

Cicero tried to re-enter politics as an independent operator, but his attempts to attack portions of Caesar&#x27;s legislation were unsuccessful and encouraged Caesar to re-solidify his political alliance with Pompey and Crassus. The conference at Luca in 56 BC left the three-man alliance in domination of the republic&#x27;s politics; this forced Cicero to recant and support the triumvirate out of fear from being entirely excluded from public life. After the conference, Cicero lavishly praised Caesar&#x27;s achievements, got the Senate to vote a thanksgiving for Caesar&#x27;s victories, and grant money to pay his troops. He also delivered a speech &#x27;On the consular provinces&#x27; () which checked an attempt by Caesar&#x27;s enemies to strip him of his provinces in Gaul. After this, a cowed Cicero concentrated on his literary works. It is uncertain whether he was directly involved in politics for the following few years. His legal work largely consisted of defending allies of the ruling and his own personal friends and allies; he defended his former pupil Marcus Caelius Rufus against a charge of murder in 56. Under the influence of the triumvirs, he had also defended his former enemies Publius Vatinius (in August 54 BCE), Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (between July and September) and Gnaeus Plancius (with the ) in September, which weakened his prestige and sparked attacks on his integrity: Luca Grillo has suggested these cases as the source of the poet Catullus&#x27;s double-edged comment that Cicero was &quot;the best defender of anybody&quot;.

==Governorship of Cilicia==

In 51 BC he reluctantly accepted a promagistracy (as proconsul) in Cilicia for the year; there were few other former consuls eligible as a result of a legislative requirement enacted by Pompey in 52 BC specifying an interval of five years between a consulship or praetorship and a provincial command. He served as proconsul of Cilicia from May 51 BC, arriving in the provinces three months later around August.

In 53 BC Marcus Licinius Crassus had been defeated by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae. This opened the Roman East for a Parthian invasion, causing unrest in Syria and Cilicia. Cicero restored calm by his mild system of government. He discovered that a great amount of public property had been embezzled by corrupt previous governors and members of their staff, and did his utmost to restore it. Thus he greatly improved the condition of the cities. He retained the civil rights of, and exempted from penalties, the men who gave the property back. Besides this, he was extremely frugal in his outlays for staff and private expenses during his governorship, and this made him highly popular among the natives.

Besides his activity in ameliorating the hard pecuniary situation of the province, Cicero was also creditably active in the military sphere. Early in his governorship he received information that prince Pacorus, son of Orodes II the king of the Parthians, had crossed the Euphrates, and was ravaging the Syrian countryside and had even besieged Cassius (the interim Roman commander in Syria) in Antioch. Cicero eventually marched with two understrength legions and a large contingent of auxiliary cavalry to Cassius&#x27;s relief. Pacorus and his army had already given up on besieging Antioch and were heading south through Syria, ravaging the countryside again. Cassius and his legions followed them, harrying them wherever they went, eventually ambushing and defeating them near Antigonea.

Another large troop of Parthian horsemen was defeated by Cicero&#x27;s cavalry who happened to run into them while scouting ahead of the main army. Cicero next defeated some robbers who were based on Mount Amanus and was hailed as imperator by his troops. Afterwards he led his army against the independent Cilician mountain tribes, besieging their fortress of Pindenissum. It took him 47 days to reduce the place, which fell in December. On 30 July 50 BC Cicero left the province to his brother Quintus, who had accompanied him on his governorship as his legate. On his way back to Rome he stopped in Rhodes and then went to Athens, where he caught up with his old friend Titus Pomponius Atticus and met men of great learning.

==Julius Caesar&#x27;s civil war==
Cicero arrived in Rome on 4 January 49 BC. He stayed outside the pomerium, to retain his promagisterial powers: either in expectation of a triumph or to retain his independent command authority in the coming civil war. The struggle between Pompey and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero favored Pompey, seeing him as a defender of the senate and Republican tradition, but at that time avoided openly alienating Caesar. When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome. Caesar, seeking an endorsement by a senior senator, courted Cicero&#x27;s favor, but even so Cicero slipped out of Italy and traveled to Dyrrhachium where Pompey&#x27;s staff was situated. Cicero traveled with the Pompeian forces to Pharsalus in Macedonia in 48 BC, though he was quickly losing faith in the competence and righteousness of the Pompeian side. Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator Cato, who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the &quot;optimates&quot; if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August, Cicero refused to take command of the Pompeian forces and continue the war. He returned to Rome, still as a promagistrate with his lictors, in 47 BC, and dismissed them upon his crossing the pomerium and renouncing his command.

In a letter to Varro on , Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken by surprise when the &quot;Liberatores&quot; assassinated Caesar on the ides of March, 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. Marcus Junius Brutus called out Cicero&#x27;s name, asking him to restore the republic when he lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination. A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to Trebonius, one of the conspirators, began, &quot;How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March!&quot; Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for Mark Antony, who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar&#x27;s murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a tyrant, which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support and kept Caesar&#x27;s reforms and policies intact.

==Opposition to Mark Antony and death==

In April 43 BC, &quot;diehard republicans&quot; may have revived the ancient position of &quot;princeps senatus&quot; (leader of the senate) for Cicero. This position had been very prestigious until the constitutional reforms of Sulla in 82–80 BC, which removed most of its importance.

On the other side, Antony was consul and leader of the Caesarian faction, and unofficial executor of Caesar&#x27;s public will. Relations between the two were never friendly and worsened after Cicero claimed that Antony was taking liberties in interpreting Caesar&#x27;s wishes and intentions. Octavian was Caesar&#x27;s adopted son and heir. After he returned to Italy, Cicero began to play him against Antony. He praised Octavian, declaring he would not make the same mistakes as his father. He attacked Antony in a series of speeches he called the &quot;Philippics&quot;, named after Demosthenes&#x27;s denunciations of Philip II of Macedon. At the time, Cicero&#x27;s popularity as a public figure was unrivalled.

Cicero supported Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus as governor of Cisalpine Gaul (&quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot;) and urged the Senate to name Antony an enemy of the state. The speech of Lucius Piso, Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an enemy of the state when he refused to lift the siege of Mutina, which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero&#x27;s plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with Lepidus to form the Second Triumvirate after the successive battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina. The alliance came into official existence with the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, passed on 27 November 43 BC, which gave each triumvir a consular &quot;imperium&quot; for five years. The Triumvirate immediately began a proscription of their enemies, modeled after that of Sulla in 82 BC. Cicero and all of his contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state, even though Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.

Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught on 7 December 43 BC leaving his villa in Formiae in a litter heading to the seaside, where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia. When his killers – Herennius (a Centurion) and Popilius (a Tribune) – arrived, Cicero&#x27;s own slaves said they had not seen him, but he was given away by Philologus, a freedman of his brother Quintus Cicero.

As reported by Seneca the Elder, according to the historian Aufidius Bassus, Cicero&#x27;s last words are said to have been:

He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was indicating that he would not resist. According to Plutarch, Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony&#x27;s instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the Rostra in the Forum Romanum according to the tradition of Marius and Sulla, both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio, in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch, Antony&#x27;s wife Fulvia took Cicero&#x27;s head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero&#x27;s power of speech.

Cicero&#x27;s son, Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor, during his year as a consul in 30 BC, avenged his father&#x27;s death, to a certain extent, when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony&#x27;s naval defeat at Actium in 31 BC by Octavian.

Octavian is reported to have praised Cicero as a patriot and a scholar of meaning in later times, within the circle of his family. However, it was Octavian&#x27;s acquiescence that had allowed Cicero to be killed, as Cicero was condemned by the new triumvirate.

Cicero&#x27;s career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. &quot;Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control, and adversity with more fortitude!&quot; wrote C. Asinius Pollio, a contemporary Roman statesman and historian.

== Personal life and family ==
Cicero married Terentia probably at the age of 27, in 79 BC. According to the upper-class of the day it was a marriage of convenience but lasted harmoniously for nearly 30 years. Terentia&#x27;s family was wealthy, probably the plebeian noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero&#x27;s political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half-sister named Fabia, who as a child had become a Vestal Virgin, a great honour. Terentia was a strong-willed woman and (citing Plutarch) &quot;took more interest in her husband&#x27;s political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs&quot;.

In the 50s BC, Cicero&#x27;s letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero&#x27;s involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before. In 46 or 45 BC, Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his ward. It is thought that Cicero needed her money, particularly after having to repay the dowry of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family.

Although his marriage to Terentia was one of convenience, it is commonly known that Cicero held great love for his daughter Tullia. When she suddenly became ill in February 45 BC and died after having seemingly recovered from giving birth to a son in January, Cicero was stunned. &quot;I have lost the one thing that bound me to life,&quot; he wrote to Atticus. Atticus told him to come for a visit during the first weeks of his bereavement, so that he could comfort him when his pain was at its greatest. In Atticus&#x27;s large library, Cicero read everything that the Greek philosophers had written about overcoming grief, &quot;but my sorrow defeats all consolation.&quot; Caesar and Brutus, as well as Servius Sulpicius Rufus, sent him letters of condolence.

Cicero hoped that his son Marcus would become a philosopher like him, but Marcus himself wished for a military career. He joined the army of Pompey in 49 BC, and after Pompey&#x27;s defeat at Pharsalus 48 BC, he was pardoned by Caesar. Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the peripatetic philosopher Kratippos in 48 BC, but he used this absence from &quot;his father&#x27;s vigilant eye&quot; to &quot;eat, drink, and be merry.&quot; After Cicero&#x27;s death, he joined the army of the &quot;Liberatores&quot; but was later pardoned by Augustus. Augustus&#x27;s bad conscience for having given in to Cicero&#x27;s being put on the proscription list during the Second Triumvirate led him to aid considerably Marcus Minor&#x27;s career. He became an augur and was nominated consul in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of Mark Antony, who was responsible for the proscription and could in this way take revenge. Later he was appointed proconsul of Syria and the province of Asia.

==Legacy==
Cicero has been traditionally considered the master of Latin prose, with Quintilian declaring that Cicero was &quot;not the name of a man, but of eloquence itself.&quot; The English words &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;eloquent&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;local guide&quot;) derive from his name. He is credited with transforming Latin from a modest utilitarian language into a versatile literary medium capable of expressing abstract and complicated thoughts with clarity. Julius Caesar praised Cicero&#x27;s achievement by saying &quot;it is more important to have greatly extended the frontiers of the Roman spirit than the frontiers of the Roman empire&quot;. According to John William Mackail, &quot;Cicero&#x27;s unique and imperishable glory is that he created the language of the civilized world, and used that language to create a style which nineteen centuries have not replaced, and in some respects have hardly altered.&quot;

Cicero was also an energetic writer with an interest in a wide variety of subjects, in keeping with the Hellenistic philosophical and rhetorical traditions in which he was trained. The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula, as suggested by a graffito at Pompeii, admonishing: &quot;You will like Cicero, or you will be whipped&quot;.

Cicero was greatly admired by influential Church Fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, who credited Cicero&#x27;s lost &quot;Hortensius&quot; for his eventual conversion to Christianity, and St. Jerome, who had a feverish vision in which he was accused of being &quot;follower of Cicero and not of Christ&quot; before the judgment seat.

This influence further increased after the Early Middle Ages in Europe, where more of his writings survived than any other Latin author&#x27;s. Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero&#x27;s writings on natural law and innate rights.

Petrarch&#x27;s rediscovery of Cicero&#x27;s letters provided the impetus for searches for ancient Greek and Latin writings scattered throughout European monasteries, and the subsequent rediscovery of classical antiquity led to the Renaissance. Subsequently, Cicero became synonymous with classical Latin to such an extent that a number of humanist scholars began to assert that no Latin word or phrase should be used unless it appeared in Cicero&#x27;s works, a stance criticised by Erasmus.

His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the first century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero&#x27;s letters contained such a wealth of detail &quot;concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government&quot; that their reader had little need for a history of the period.

Among Cicero&#x27;s admirers were Desiderius Erasmus, Martin Luther, and John Locke. Following the invention of Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press, &quot;De Officiis&quot; was the second book printed in Europe, after the Gutenberg Bible. Scholars note Cicero&#x27;s influence on the rebirth of religious toleration in the 17th century.

Cicero was especially popular with the Philosophes of the 18th century, including Edward Gibbon, Diderot, David Hume, Montesquieu, and Voltaire. Gibbon wrote of his first experience reading the author&#x27;s collective works thus: &quot;I tasted the beauty of the language; I breathed the spirit of freedom; and I imbibed from his precepts and examples the public and private sense of a man...after finishing the great author, a library of eloquence and reason, I formed a more extensive plan of reviewing the Latin classics...&quot;

Voltaire called Cicero &quot;the greatest as well as the most elegant of Roman philosophers&quot; and even staged a play based on Cicero&#x27;s role in the Catilinarian conspiracy, called &quot;Rome Sauvée, ou Catilina&quot;, to &quot;make young people who go to the theatre acquainted with Cicero.&quot; Voltaire was spurred to pen the drama as a rebuff to his rival Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon&#x27;s own play &quot;Catilina&quot;, which had portrayed Cicero as a coward and villain who hypocritically married his own daughter to Catiline.

Montesquieu produced his &quot;Discourse on Cicero&quot; in 1717, in which he heaped praise on the author because he rescued &quot;philosophy from the hands of scholars, and freed it from the confusion of a foreign language&quot;. Montesquieu went on to declare that Cicero was &quot;of all the ancients, the one who had the most personal merit, and whom I would prefer to resemble.&quot;

Cicero the republican inspired the Founding Fathers of the United States and the revolutionaries of the French Revolution. John Adams said, &quot;As all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united than Cicero, his authority should have great weight.&quot; Thomas Jefferson names Cicero as one of a handful of major figures who contributed to a tradition &quot;of public right&quot; that informed his draft of the Declaration of Independence and shaped American understandings of &quot;the common sense&quot; basis for the right of revolution. Camille Desmoulins said of the French republicans in 1789 that they were &quot;mostly young people who, nourished by the reading of Cicero at school, had become passionate enthusiasts for liberty&quot;.

In the modern era, American libertarian Jim Powell starts his history of liberty with the sentence: &quot;Marcus Tullius Cicero expressed principles that became the bedrock of liberty in the modern world.&quot;

Likewise, no other ancient personality has inspired as much venomous dislike as Cicero, especially in more modern times. His commitment to the values of the Republic accommodated a hatred of the poor and persistent opposition to the advocates and mechanisms of popular representation. Friedrich Engels referred to him as &quot;the most contemptible scoundrel in history&quot; for upholding republican &quot;democracy&quot; while at the same time denouncing land and class reforms. Cicero has faced criticism for exaggerating the democratic qualities of republican Rome, and for defending the Roman oligarchy against the popular reforms of Caesar. Michael Parenti admits Cicero&#x27;s abilities as an orator, but finds him a vain, pompous and hypocritical personality who, when it suited him, could show public support for popular causes that he privately despised. Parenti presents Cicero&#x27;s prosecution of the Catiline conspiracy as legally flawed at least, and possibly unlawful.

Cicero also had an influence on modern astronomy. Nicolaus Copernicus, searching for ancient views on earth motion, said that he &quot;first ... found in Cicero that Hicetas supposed the earth to move.&quot;

Notably, &quot;Cicero&quot; was the name attributed to size 12 font in typesetting table drawers. For ease of reference, type sizes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20 were all given different names.

==Works==
Cicero was declared a righteous pagan by the Early Church. Subsequent Roman and medieval Christian writers quoted liberally from his works &quot;De re publica&quot; (&quot;On the Commonwealth&quot;) and &quot;De Legibus&quot; (&quot;On the Laws&quot;), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract conceptualization of rights, based on ancient law and custom. Of Cicero&#x27;s books, six on rhetoric have survived, as well as parts of seven on philosophy. Of his speeches, 88 were recorded, but only 52 survive.

==In archaeology==
Cicero&#x27;s great repute in Italy has led to numerous ruins being identified as having belonged to him, though none have been substantiated with absolute certainty. In Formia, two Roman-era ruins are popularly believed to be Cicero&#x27;s mausoleum, the &quot;Tomba di Cicerone&quot;, and the villa where he was assassinated in 43 BC. The latter building is centered around a central hall with Doric columns and a coffered vault, with a separate nymphaeum, on five acres of land near Formia. A modern villa was built on the site after the Rubino family purchased the land from Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies in 1868. Cicero&#x27;s supposed tomb is a 24-meter (79 feet) tall tower on an &quot;opus quadratum&quot; base on the ancient Via Appia outside of Formia. Some suggest that it is not in fact Cicero&#x27;s tomb, but a monument built on the spot where Cicero was intercepted and assassinated while trying to reach the sea.

In Pompeii, a large villa excavated in the mid 18th century just outside the Herculaneum Gate was widely believed to have been Cicero&#x27;s, who was known to have owned a holiday villa in Pompeii he called his &quot;Pompeianum&quot;. The villa was stripped of its fine frescoes and mosaics and then re-buried after 1763 – it has yet to be re-excavated. However, contemporaneous descriptions of the building from the excavators combined with Cicero&#x27;s own references to his &quot;Pompeianum&quot; differ, making it unlikely that it is Cicero&#x27;s villa.

In Rome, the location of Cicero&#x27;s house has been roughly identified from excavations of the Republican-era stratum on the northwestern slope of the Palatine Hill. Cicero&#x27;s &quot;domus&quot; has long been known to have stood in the area, according to his own descriptions and those of later authors, but there is some debate about whether it stood near the base of the hill, very close to the Roman Forum, or nearer to the summit. During his life the area was the most desirable in Rome, densely occupied with Patrician houses including the &quot;Domus Publica&quot; of Julius Caesar and the home of Cicero&#x27;s mortal enemy Clodius.

==Notable fictional portrayals==
In Dante&#x27;s 1320 poem the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the author encounters Cicero, among other philosophers, in Limbo. Ben Jonson dramatised the conspiracy of Catiline in his play &quot;Catiline His Conspiracy&quot;, featuring Cicero as a character. Cicero also appears as a minor character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

Cicero was portrayed on the motion picture screen by British actor Alan Napier in the 1953 film &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play. He has also been played by such noted actors as Michael Hordern (in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;), and André Morell (in the 1970 &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). Most recently, Cicero was portrayed by David Bamber in the HBO series &quot;Rome&quot; (2005–2007) and appeared in both seasons.

In the historical novel series &quot;Masters of Rome&quot;, Colleen McCullough presents a not-so-flattering depiction of Cicero&#x27;s career, showing him struggling with an inferiority complex and vanity, morally flexible and fatally indiscreet, while his rival Julius Caesar is shown in a more approving light. Cicero is portrayed as a hero in the novel &quot;A Pillar of Iron&quot; by Taylor Caldwell (1965). Robert Harris&#x27; novels &quot;Imperium&quot;, &quot;Lustrum&quot; (published under the name &quot;Conspirata&quot; in the United States) and &quot;Dictator&quot; comprise a three-part series based on the life of Cicero. In these novels Cicero&#x27;s character is depicted in a more favorable way than in those of McCullough, with his positive traits equaling or outweighing his weaknesses (while conversely Caesar is depicted as more sinister than in McCullough). Cicero is a major recurring character in the &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; series of mystery novels by Steven Saylor. He also appears several times as a peripheral character in John Maddox Roberts&#x27; &quot;SPQR&quot; series.

Samuel Barnett portrays Cicero in a 2017 audio drama series pilot produced by Big Finish Productions. A full series was released the following year. All episodes are written by David Llewellyn and directed and produced by Scott Handcock.

Giancarlo Esposito portrays Mayor Franklyn Cicero, a character from Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 2024 sci-fi epic film Megalopolis, which is a modern futuristic interpretation of the Catiline Conspiracy. In the film, Esposito stars opposite Adam Driver, who portrays a character named Cesar Catilina.

<doc id="6047" wikidata="Q4489757" url="?curid=6047" title="Consul">
<text>Consul (abbrev. &quot;cos.&quot;; Latin plural &quot;consules&quot;) was the title of one of the two chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently also an important title under the Roman Empire. The title was used in other European city-states through antiquity and the Middle Ages, in particular in the Republics of Genoa and Pisa, then revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The related adjective is consular, from the Latin &quot;consularis&quot;.

This usage contrasts with modern terminology, where a consul is a type of diplomat.

==Roman consul==

A consul held the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic (509 to 27 BC), and ancient Romans considered the consulship the highest level of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; (an ascending sequence of public offices to which politicians aspired). Consuls were elected to office and held power for one year. There were always two consuls in power at any time.

==Other uses in antiquity==

===Private sphere===
It was not uncommon for an organization under Roman private law to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own statutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation was called &quot;lex&quot;, &#x27;law&#x27;. The people elected each year were patricians, members of the upper class.

===City-states===
While many cities, including the Gallic states and the Carthaginian Republic, had a double-headed chief magistracy, another title was often used, such as the Punic &quot;sufet&quot;, &quot;Duumvir&quot;, or native styles like &quot;Meddix&quot;.

==Medieval city-states, communes and municipalities==

=== Republic of Genoa ===
The city-state of Genoa, unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of &quot;consul&quot; on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities. Great Britain reciprocated by appointing consuls to Genoa from 1722. This institution, with its name, was later emulated by other powers and is reflected in the modern usage of the word (see Consul (representative)).

=== Republic of Pisa ===
In addition to the Genoese Republic, the Republic of Pisa also took the form of &quot;Consul&quot; in the early stages of its government. The Consulate of the Republic of Pisa was the major government institution present in Pisa from 1087 to 1189. Despite losing space within the government since 1190 in favor of the Podestà, for some periods of the 13th century some citizens were again elected as consuls.

=== Other uses in the Medieval period ===

Throughout most of southern France, a consul ( or &quot;&quot;) was an office equivalent to the of the north and roughly similar with English aldermen. The most prominent were those of Bordeaux and Toulouse, which came to be known as jurats and capitouls, respectively. The capitouls of Toulouse were granted transmittable nobility. In many other smaller towns the first consul was the equivalent of a mayor today, assisted by a variable number of secondary consuls and jurats. His main task was to levy and collect tax.

The Dukes of Gaeta often used also the title of &quot;consul&quot; in its Greek form &quot;Hypatos&quot; (see List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta).

==French Revolution==

===French Republic 1799–1804===

After Napoleon Bonaparte staged a coup against the Directory government in November 1799, the French Republic adopted a constitution which conferred executive powers upon three consuls, elected for a period of ten years. In reality, the first consul, Bonaparte, dominated his two colleagues and held supreme power, soon making himself consul for life (1802) and eventually, in 1804, emperor.

The office was held by:

* Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, Roger Ducos, provisional consuls (10 November – 12 December 1799)
* Napoleon Bonaparte (first consul), Jean-Jacques Cambacérès (second consul), Charles-François Lebrun (third consul), consuls (12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804)

===Bolognese Republic, 1796===
The short-lived Bolognese Republic, proclaimed in 1796 as a French client republic in the Central Italian city of Bologna, had a government consisting of nine consuls and its head of state was the &quot;Presidente del Magistrato&quot;, i.e., chief magistrate, a presiding office held for four months by one of the consuls. Bologna already had consuls at some parts of its Medieval history.

===Roman Republic, 1798–1800===
The French-sponsored Roman Republic (15 February 1798 – 23 June 1800) was headed by multiple consuls:
* Francesco Riganti, Carlo Luigi Costantini, Duke Bonelli-Crescenzi, Antonio Bassi, Gioacchino Pessuti, Angelo Stampa, Domenico Maggi, provisional consuls (15 February – 20 March 1798)
* Liborio Angelucci, Giacomo De Mattheis, Panazzi, Reppi, Ennio Quirino Visconti, consuls (20 March – September 1798)
* Brigi, Calisti, Francesco Pierelli, Giuseppe Rey, Federico Maria Domenico Michele, Zaccaleoni, consuls (September – 24 July 1799)

Consular rule was interrupted by the Neapolitan occupation (27 November – 12 December 1798), which installed a Provisional Government:
* Prince Giambattista Borghese, Prince Paolo-Maria Aldobrandini, Prince Gibrielli, Marchese Camillo Massimo, Giovanni Ricci (29 November 1798 - 12 December 1798)

Rome was occupied by France (11 July – 28 September 1799) and again by Naples (30 September 1799 – 23 June 1800), bringing an end to the Roman Republic.

==Revolutionary Greece, 1821==
Among the many petty local republics that were formed during the first year of the Greek Revolution, prior to the creation of a unified Provisional Government at the First National Assembly at Epidaurus, were:
* The Consulate of Argos (from 26 May 1821, under the Senate of the Peloponnese) had a &quot;single&quot; head of state, styled consul, 28 March 1821 – 26 May 1821: Stamatellos Antonopoulos
* The Consulate of East Greece (Livadeia) (from 15 November 1821, under the Areopagus of East Greece) was headed 1 April 1821 – 15 November 1821 by three consuls: Lambros Nakos, Ioannis Logothetis &amp; Ioannis Filon
&quot;Note: in Greek, the term for &quot;consul&quot; is &quot;hypatos&quot; (ὕπατος), which translates as &quot;supreme one&quot;, and hence does not necessarily imply a joint office.&quot;

==Paraguay, 1813–1844==
In between a series of juntas and various other short-lived regimes, the young republic was governed by &quot;consuls of the republic&quot;, with two consuls alternating in power every 4 months:
* 12 October 1813 – 12 February 1814, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco
* 12 February 1814 – 12 June 1814, Fulgencio Yegros y Franco de Torres
* 12 June 1814 – 3 October 1814, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco; he stayed on as &quot;supreme dictator&quot; 3 October 1814 – 20 September 1840 (from 6 June 1816 styled &quot;perpetual supreme dictator&quot;)

After a few presidents of the Provisional Junta, there were again consuls of the republic, 14 March 1841 – 13 March 1844 (ruling jointly, but occasionally styled &quot;first consul&quot;, &quot;second consul&quot;): Carlos Antonio López Ynsfrán (b. 1792 – d. 1862) + Mariano Roque Alonzo Romero (d. 1853) (the lasts of the aforementioned juntistas, Commandant-General of the Army)
Thereafter all republican rulers were styled &quot;president&quot;.

==Modern uses of the term==

In modern terminology, a consul is a type of diplomat. The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; defines consul as &quot;an official appointed by a government to reside in a foreign country and represent its interests there.&quot; &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defines Consul as &quot;in American politics, a person who having failed to secure an office from the people is given one by the Administration on condition that he leave the country&quot;.

In most governments, the consul is the head of the consular section of an embassy, and is responsible for all consular services such as immigrant and non-immigrant visas, passports, and citizen services for expatriates living or traveling in the host country.
A less common modern usage is when the consul of one country takes a governing role in the host country.

<doc id="6050" wikidata="Q6618987" url="?curid=6050" title="List of equations in classical mechanics">
<text>Classical mechanics is the branch of physics used to describe the motion of macroscopic objects. It is the most familiar of the theories of physics. The concepts it covers, such as mass, acceleration, and force, are commonly used and known. The subject is based upon a three-dimensional Euclidean space with fixed axes, called a frame of reference. The point of concurrency of the three axes is known as the origin of the particular space.

Classical mechanics utilises many equations—as well as other mathematical concepts—which relate various physical quantities to one another. These include differential equations, manifolds, Lie groups, and ergodic theory. This article gives a summary of the most important of these.

This article lists equations from Newtonian mechanics, see analytical mechanics for the more general formulation of classical mechanics (which includes Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics).

==Classical mechanics==

===Mass and inertia===

===Derived kinematic quantities===

===Derived dynamic quantities===

===General energy definitions===

Every conservative force has a potential energy. By following two principles one can consistently assign a non-relative value to &quot;U&quot;:

* Wherever the force is zero, its potential energy is defined to be zero as well.
* Whenever the force does work, potential energy is lost.

===Generalized mechanics===


==Kinematics==

In the following rotational definitions, the angle can be any angle about the specified axis of rotation. It is customary to use &quot;θ&quot;, but this does not have to be the polar angle used in polar coordinate systems. The unit axial vector

formula_1

defines the axis of rotation, formula_2 = unit vector in direction of , formula_3 = unit vector tangential to the angle.

==Dynamics==

=== Precession ===

The precession angular speed of a spinning top is given by:

formula_4

where &quot;w&quot; is the weight of the spinning flywheel.

== Energy ==

The mechanical work done by an external agent on a system is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the system:

=== General work-energy theorem (translation and rotation) ===

The work done &quot;W&quot; by an external agent which exerts a force F (at r) and torque τ on an object along a curved path &quot;C&quot; is:

formula_5

where θ is the angle of rotation about an axis defined by a unit vector n.

=== Kinetic energy ===
The change in kinetic energy for an object initially traveling at speed formula_6 and later at speed formula_7 is:
formula_8

=== Elastic potential energy ===

For a stretched spring fixed at one end obeying Hooke&#x27;s law, the elastic potential energy is

formula_9

where &quot;r&quot;2 and &quot;r&quot;1 are collinear coordinates of the free end of the spring, in the direction of the extension/compression, and k is the spring constant.

==Euler&#x27;s equations for rigid body dynamics==

{{main article|Euler&#x27;s equations (rigid body dynamics)}}

Euler also worked out analogous laws of motion to those of Newton, see Euler&#x27;s laws of motion. These extend the scope of Newton&#x27;s laws to rigid bodies, but are essentially the same as above. A new equation Euler formulated is:

formula_10

where I is the moment of inertia tensor.

==General planar motion==

{{see also|Polar coordinate system#Vector calculus|label 1=Polar coordinate system (section: vector calculus)}}

The previous equations for planar motion can be used here: corollaries of momentum, angular momentum etc. can immediately follow by applying the above definitions. For any object moving in any path in a plane,

formula_11

the following general results apply to the particle.

=== Central force motion ===

For a massive body moving in a central potential due to another object, which depends only on the radial separation between the centers of masses of the two objects, the equation of motion is:

formula_12

== Equations of motion (constant acceleration) ==
These equations can be used only when acceleration is constant. If acceleration is not constant then the general calculus equations above must be used, found by integrating the definitions of position, velocity and acceleration (see above).

{{see also|Linear motion#Analogy between linear and rotational motion}}

==Galilean frame transforms==

For classical (Galileo-Newtonian) mechanics, the transformation law from one inertial or accelerating (including rotation) frame (reference frame traveling at constant velocity - including zero) to another is the Galilean transform.

Unprimed quantities refer to position, velocity and acceleration in one frame F; primed quantities refer to position, velocity and acceleration in another frame F&#x27; moving at translational velocity V or angular velocity Ω relative to F. Conversely F moves at velocity (—V or —Ω) relative to F&#x27;. The situation is similar for relative accelerations.

==Mechanical oscillators==

SHM, DHM, SHO, and DHO refer to simple harmonic motion, damped harmonic motion, simple harmonic oscillator and damped harmonic oscillator respectively.

<doc id="6051" wikidata="Q27518" url="?curid=6051" title="Cursus honorum">
<text>The , or more colloquially &#x27;ladder of offices&#x27;; ) was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. It was designed for men of senatorial rank. The &quot;cursus honorum&quot; comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts; the ultimate prize for winning election to each &quot;rung&quot; in the sequence was to become one of the two consuls in a given year.

These rules were altered and flagrantly ignored in the course of the last century of the Republic. For example, Gaius Marius held consulships for five years in a row between 104 BC and 100 BC. He was consul seven times in all, also serving in 107 and 86. Officially presented as opportunities for public service, the offices often became mere opportunities for self-aggrandizement. The constitutional reforms of Sulla between 82 and 79 BC required a ten-year interval before holding the same office again for another term.

To have held each office at the youngest possible age (&quot;suo anno&quot;, &#x27;in his year&#x27;) was considered a great political success. For instance, to miss out on a praetorship at 39 meant that one could not become consul at 42. Cicero expressed extreme pride not only in being a &quot;novus homo&quot; (&#x27;new man&#x27;; comparable to a &quot;self-made man&quot;) who became consul even though none of his ancestors had ever served as a consul, but also in having become consul &quot;in his year&quot;.

== Military service ==

Prior to entering political life and the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, a young man of senatorial rank was expected to serve around ten years of military duty. The years of service were intended to be mandatory in order to qualify for political office.

Advancement and honors would improve his political prospects, and a successful military career might culminate in the office of military tribune, to which 24 men were elected by the Tribal Assembly each year. The rank of military tribune is sometimes described as the first office of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

== Quaestor ==

The first official post was that of quaestor. Ever since the reforms of Sulla, candidates had to be at least 30 years old to hold the office. From the time of Augustus onwards, twenty quaestors served in the financial administration at Rome or as second-in-command to a governor in the provinces. They could also serve as the paymaster for a legion.

== Aedile ==
At 36 years of age, a promagistrate could stand for election to one of the aediles (pronounced , from &quot;aedes&quot;, &quot;temple edifice&quot;) positions. Of these aediles, two were plebeian and two were patrician, with the patrician aediles called curule aediles. The plebeian aediles were elected by the Plebeian Council and the curule aediles were either elected by the Tribal Assembly or appointed by the reigning consul. The aediles had administrative responsibilities in Rome. They had to take care of the temples (whence their title, from the Latin &quot;aedes&quot;, &quot;temple&quot;), organize games, and be responsible for the maintenance of the public buildings in Rome. Moreover, they took charge of Rome&#x27;s water and food supplies; in their capacity as market superintendents, they served sometimes as judges in mercantile affairs.

The aedile was the supervisor of public works; the words &quot;edifice&quot; and &quot;edification&quot; stem from the same root. He oversaw the public works, temples and markets. Therefore, the aediles would have been in some cooperation with the current censors, who had similar or related duties. Also, they oversaw the organization of festivals and games (&quot;ludi&quot;), which made this a very sought-after office for a career minded politician of the late Republic, as it was a good means of gaining popularity by staging spectacles.

Curule aediles were added at a later date in the 4th century BC; their duties do not differ substantially from plebeian aediles. However, unlike plebeian aediles, curule aediles were allowed certain symbols of rank—the &quot;sella curulis&quot; or curule chair, for example—and only patricians could stand for election to curule aedile. This later changed, and both plebeians and patricians could stand for curule aedileship.

The elections for curule aedile were at first alternated between patricians and plebeians, until late in the 2nd century BC, when the practice was abandoned and both classes became free to run during all years.

While part of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, this step was optional and not required to hold future offices. Though the office was usually held after the quaestorship and before the praetorship, there are some cases with former praetors serving as aediles.

== Praetor ==

After serving either as quaestor or as aedile, a man of 39 years could run for praetor. During the reign of Augustus this requirement was lowered to 30, at the request of Gaius Maecenas. The number of praetors elected varied through history, generally increasing with time. During the republic, six or eight were generally elected each year to serve judicial functions throughout Rome and other governmental responsibilities. In the absence of the consuls, a praetor would be given command of the garrison in Rome or in Italy. Also, a praetor could exercise the functions of the consuls throughout Rome, but their main function was that of a judge. They would preside over trials involving criminal acts, grant court orders and validate &quot;illegal&quot; acts as acts of administering justice. A praetor was escorted by six lictors, and wielded &quot;imperium&quot;. After a term as praetor, the magistrate could serve as a provincial governor with the title of propraetor, wielding &quot;propraetor imperium&quot;, commanding the province&#x27;s legions, and possessing ultimate authority within his province(s).

Two of the praetors were more prestigious than the others. The first was the Praetor Peregrinus, who was the chief judge in trials involving one or more foreigners. The other was the Praetor Urbanus, the chief judicial office in Rome. He had the power to overturn any verdict by any other courts, and served as judge in cases involving criminal charges against provincial governors. The Praetor Urbanus was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days. If one of these two praetors was absent from Rome, the other would perform the duties of both.

== Consul ==

The office of consul was the most prestigious of all of the offices on the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, and represented the summit of a successful career. The minimum age was 42. Years were identified by the names of the two consuls elected for a particular year; for instance, &quot;M. Messalla et M. Pisone consulibus&quot;, &quot;in the consulship of Messalla and Piso&quot;, dates an event to 61 BC. Consuls were responsible for the city&#x27;s political agenda, commanded large-scale armies and controlled important provinces. The consuls served for only a year (a restriction intended to limit the amassing of power by individuals) and could only rule when they agreed, because each consul could veto the other&#x27;s decision.

The consuls would alternate monthly as the chairman of the Senate. They also were the supreme commanders in the Roman army, with each being granted two legions during their consular year. Consuls also exercised the highest juridical power in the Republic, being the only office with the power to override the decisions of the Praetor Urbanus. Only laws and the decrees of the Senate or the People&#x27;s assembly limited their powers, and only the veto of a fellow consul or a tribune of the plebs could supersede their decisions.

A consul was escorted by twelve lictors, held &quot;imperium&quot; and wore the toga &quot;praetexta&quot;. Because the consul was the highest executive office within the Republic, they had the power to veto any action or proposal by any other magistrate, save that of the Tribune of the Plebs. After a consulship, a consul was assigned one of the more important provinces and acted as the governor in the same way that a propraetor did, only owning proconsular &quot;imperium&quot;. A second consulship could only be attempted after an interval of 10 years to prevent one man holding too much power.

== Governor ==

Although not part of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, upon completing a term as either praetor or consul, an officer was required to serve a term as propraetor and proconsul, respectively, in one of Rome&#x27;s many provinces. These propraetors and proconsuls held near autocratic authority within their selected province or provinces. Because each governor held equal &quot;imperium&quot; to the equivalent magistrate, they were escorted by the same number of lictors (12) and could only be vetoed by a reigning consul or praetor. Their abilities to govern were only limited by the decrees of the Senate or the people&#x27;s assemblies, and the Tribune of the Plebs was unable to veto their acts as long as the governor remained at least a mile outside of Rome.

== Censor ==

After a term as consul, the final step in the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; was the office of &quot;censor&quot;. This was the only office in the Roman Republic whose term was a period of eighteen months instead of the usual twelve. Censors were elected every five years and although the office held no military &quot;imperium&quot;, it was considered a great honour. The censors took a regular census of the people and then apportioned the citizens into voting classes on the basis of income and tribal affiliation. The censors enrolled new citizens in tribes and voting classes as well. The censors were also in charge of the membership roll of the Senate, every five years adding new senators who had been elected to the requisite offices. Censors could also remove unworthy members from the Senate. This ability was lost during the dictatorship of Sulla. Censors were also responsible for construction of public buildings and the moral status of the city.

Censors also had financial duties, in that they had to put out to tender projects that were to be financed by the state. Also, the censors were in charge of the leasing out of conquered land for public use and auction. Though this office owned no &quot;imperium&quot;, meaning no lictors for protection, they were allowed to wear the toga &quot;praetexta&quot;.

== Tribune of the Plebs ==

The office of Tribune of the Plebs was an important step in the political career of plebeians. Patricians could not hold the office. They were not an official step in the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. The Tribune was an office first created to protect the right of the common man in Roman politics and served as the head of the Plebeian Council. In the mid-to-late Republic, however, plebeians were often just as, and sometimes more, wealthy and powerful than patricians. Those who held the office were granted sacrosanctity (the right to be legally protected from any physical harm), the power to rescue any plebeian from the hands of a patrician magistrate, and the right to veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, including another tribune of the people and the consuls. The tribune also had the power to exercise capital punishment against any person who interfered in the performance of his duties. The tribunes could even convene a Senate meeting and lay legislation before it and arrest magistrates. Their houses had to remain open for visitors even during the night, and they were not allowed to be more than a day&#x27;s journey from Rome. Due to their unique power of sacrosanctity, the Tribune had no need for lictors for protection and owned no &quot;imperium&quot;, nor could they wear the toga &quot;praetexta&quot;. For a period after Sulla&#x27;s reforms, a person who had held the office of Tribune of the Plebs could no longer qualify for any other office, and the powers of the tribunes were more limited, but these restrictions were subsequently lifted.

== &quot;Princeps senatus&quot; ==

Another office not officially a step in the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; was the &quot;princeps senatus&quot;, an extremely prestigious office for a patrician. The &quot;princeps senatus&quot; served as the leader of the Senate and was chosen to serve a five-year term by each pair of Censors every five years. Censors could, however, confirm a &quot;princeps senatus&quot; for a period of another five years. The &quot;princeps senatus&quot; was chosen from all Patricians who had served as a Consul, with former Censors usually holding the office. The office originally granted the holder the ability to speak first at session on the topic presented by the presiding magistrate, but eventually gained the power to open and close the senate sessions, decide the agenda, decide where the session should take place, impose order and other rules of the session, meet in the name of the senate with embassies of foreign countries, and write in the name of the senate letters and dispatches. This office, like the Tribune, did not own &quot;imperium&quot;, was not escorted by lictors, and could not wear the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;.

== Dictator and &quot;magister equitum&quot; ==

Of all the offices within the Roman Republic, none granted as much power and authority as the position of dictator, known as the Master of the People. In times of emergency, the Senate would declare that a dictator was required, and the current consuls would appoint a dictator. This was the only decision that could not be vetoed by the Tribune of the Plebs. The dictator was the sole exception to the Roman legal principles of having multiple magistrates in the same office and being legally able to be held to answer for actions in office. Essentially by definition, only one dictator could serve at a time, and no dictator could ever be held legally responsible for any action during his time in office for any reason.

The dictator was the highest magistrate in degree of &quot;imperium&quot; and was attended by twenty-four lictors (as were the former Kings of Rome). Although his term lasted only six months instead of twelve (except for the Dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar), all other magistrates reported to the dictator (except for the tribunes of the plebs – although they could not veto any of the dictator&#x27;s acts), granting the dictator absolute authority in both civil and military matters throughout the Republic. The dictator was free from the control of the Senate in all that he did, could execute anyone without a trial for any reason, and could ignore any law in the performance of his duties. The dictator was the sole magistrate under the Republic that was truly independent in discharging his duties. All of the other offices were extensions of the Senate&#x27;s executive authority and thus answerable to the Senate. Since the dictator exercised his own authority, he did not suffer this limitation, which was the cornerstone of the office&#x27;s power.

When a dictator entered office, he appointed to serve as his second-in-command a &quot;magister equitum&quot;, the Master of the Horse, whose office ceased to exist once the dictator left office. The &quot;magister equitum&quot; held &quot;praetorian imperium&quot;, was attended by six lictors, and was charged with assisting the dictator in managing the State. When the dictator was away from Rome, the &quot;magister equitum&quot; usually remained behind to administer the city. The &quot;magister equitum&quot;, like the dictator, had unchallengeable authority in all civil and military affairs, with his decisions only being overturned by the dictator himself.

The dictatorship was definitively abolished in 44 BC after the assassination of Gaius Julius Caesar (&quot;Lex Antonia&quot;).

<doc id="6056" wikidata="Q178605" url="?curid=6056" title="Continental drift">
<text>Continental drift is a highly supported scientific theory, originating in the early 20th century, that Earth&#x27;s continents move or drift relative to each other over geologic time. The theory of continental drift has since been validated and incorporated into the science of plate tectonics, which studies the movement of the continents as they ride on plates of the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere.

The speculation that continents might have &quot;drifted&quot; was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596. A pioneer of the modern view of mobilism was the Austrian geologist Otto Ampferer. The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener in his 1915 publication, &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot;. However, at that time his hypothesis was rejected by many for lack of any motive mechanism. In 1931, the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed mantle convection for that mechanism.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Abraham Ortelius , Theodor Christoph Lilienthal (1756), Alexander von Humboldt (1801 and 1845), Antonio Snider-Pellegrini , and others had noted earlier that the shapes of continents on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean (most notably, Africa and South America) seem to fit together. W. J. Kious described Ortelius&#x27;s thoughts in this way:
In 1889, Alfred Russel Wallace remarked, &quot;It was formerly a very general belief, even amongst geologists, that the great features of the earth&#x27;s surface, no less than the smaller ones, were subject to continual mutations, and that during the course of known geological time the continents and great oceans had, again and again, changed places with each other.&quot; He quotes Charles Lyell as saying, &quot;Continents, therefore, although permanent for whole geological epochs, shift their positions entirely in the course of ages.&quot; and claims that the first to throw doubt on this was James Dwight Dana in 1849.

In his &quot;Manual of Geology&quot; (1863), Dana wrote, &quot;The continents and oceans had their general outline or form defined in earliest time. This has been proved with regard to North America from the position and distribution of the first beds of the Lower Silurian, – those of the Potsdam epoch. The facts indicate that the continent of North America had its surface near tide-level, part above and part below it (p.196); and this will probably be proved to be the condition in Primordial time of the other continents also. And, if the outlines of the continents were marked out, it follows that the outlines of the oceans were no less so&quot;. Dana was enormously influential in America—his &quot;Manual of Mineralogy&quot; is still in print in revised form—and the theory became known as the &quot;Permanence theory&quot;.

This appeared to be confirmed by the exploration of the deep sea beds conducted by the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition, 1872–1876, which showed that contrary to expectation, land debris brought down by rivers to the ocean is deposited comparatively close to the shore on what is now known as the continental shelf. This suggested that the oceans were a permanent feature of the Earth&#x27;s surface, rather than them having &quot;changed places&quot; with the continents.

Eduard Suess had proposed a supercontinent Gondwana in 1885 and the Tethys Ocean in 1893, assuming a land-bridge between the present continents submerged in the form of a geosyncline, and John Perry had written an 1895 paper proposing that the Earth&#x27;s interior was fluid, and disagreeing with Lord Kelvin on the age of the Earth.

=== Wegener and his predecessors ===
Apart from the earlier speculations mentioned above, the idea that the American continents had once formed a single landmass with Eurasia and Africa was postulated by several scientists before Alfred Wegener&#x27;s 1912 paper. Although Wegener&#x27;s theory was formed independently and was more complete than those of his predecessors, Wegener later credited a number of past authors with similar ideas: Franklin Coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890), Roberto Mantovani (between 1889 and 1909), William Henry Pickering (1907) and Frank Bursley Taylor (1908).

The similarity of southern continent geological formations had led Roberto Mantovani to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had once been joined into a supercontinent; Wegener noted the similarity of Mantovani&#x27;s and his own maps of the former positions of the southern continents. In Mantovani&#x27;s conjecture, this continent broke due to volcanic activity caused by thermal expansion, and the new continents drifted away from each other because of further expansion of the rip-zones, where the oceans now lie. This led Mantovani to propose a now-discredited Expanding Earth theory.

Continental drift without expansion was proposed by Frank Bursley Taylor, who suggested in 1908 (published in 1910) that the continents were moved into their present positions by a process of &quot;continental creep&quot;, later proposing a mechanism of increased tidal forces during the Cretaceous dragging the crust towards the equator. He was the first to realize that one of the effects of continental motion would be the formation of mountains, attributing the formation of the Himalayas to the collision between the Indian subcontinent with Asia. Wegener said that of all those theories, Taylor&#x27;s had the most similarities to his own. For a time in the mid-20th century, the theory of continental drift was referred to as the &quot;Taylor-Wegener hypothesis&quot;.

Alfred Wegener first presented his hypothesis to the German Geological Society on 6 January 1912. He proposed that the continents had once formed a single landmass, called Pangaea, before breaking apart and drifting to their present locations.

Wegener was the first to use the phrase &quot;continental drift&quot; (1912, 1915) () and to publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow &quot;drifted&quot; apart. Although he presented much evidence for continental drift, he was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which might have caused this drift. He suggested that the continents had been pulled apart by the centrifugal pseudoforce () of the Earth&#x27;s rotation or by a small component of astronomical precession, but calculations showed that the force was not sufficient. The hypothesis was also studied by Paul Sophus Epstein in 1920 and found to be implausible.

=== Rejection of Wegener&#x27;s theory, 1910s–1950s ===
Although now accepted, and even with a minority of scientific proponents over the decades, the theory of continental drift was largely rejected for many years, with evidence in its favor considered insufficient. One problem was that a plausible driving force was missing. A second problem was that Wegener&#x27;s estimate of the speed of continental motion, , was implausibly high. (The currently accepted rate for the separation of the Americas from Europe and Africa is about .) Furthermore, Wegener was treated less seriously because he was not a geologist. Even today, the details of the forces propelling the plates are poorly understood.

The English geologist Arthur Holmes championed the theory of continental drift at a time when it was deeply unfashionable. He proposed in 1931 that the Earth&#x27;s mantle contained convection cells which dissipated heat produced by radioactive decay and moved the crust at the surface. His &quot;Principles of Physical Geology&quot;, ending with a chapter on continental drift, was published in 1944.

Geological maps of the time showed huge land bridges spanning the Atlantic and Indian oceans to account for the similarities of fauna and flora and the divisions of the Asian continent in the Permian period, but failing to account for glaciation in India, Australia and South Africa.

====The fixists====
Hans Stille and Leopold Kober opposed the idea of continental drift and worked on a &quot;fixist&quot; geosyncline model with Earth contraction playing a key role in the formation of orogens. Other geologists who opposed continental drift were Bailey Willis, Charles Schuchert, Rollin Chamberlin, Walther Bucher and Walther Penck. In 1939 an international geological conference was held in Frankfurt. This conference came to be dominated by the fixists, especially as those geologists specializing in tectonics were all fixists except Willem van der Gracht. Criticism of continental drift and mobilism was abundant at the conference not only from tectonicists but also from sedimentological (Nölke), paleontological (Nölke), mechanical (Lehmann) and oceanographic (Troll, Wüst) perspectives. Hans Cloos, the organizer of the conference, was also a fixist who together with Troll held the view that excepting the Pacific Ocean continents were not radically different from oceans in their behaviour. The mobilist theory of Émile Argand for the Alpine orogeny was criticized by Kurt Leuchs. The few drifters and mobilists at the conference appealed to biogeography (Kirsch, Wittmann), paleoclimatology (Wegener, K), paleontology (Gerth) and geodetic measurements (Wegener, K). F. Bernauer correctly equated Reykjanes in south-west Iceland with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, arguing with this that the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was undergoing extension just like Reykjanes. Bernauer thought this extension had drifted the continents only apart, the approximate width of the volcanic zone in Iceland.

David Attenborough, who attended university in the second half of the 1940s, recounted an incident illustrating its lack of acceptance then: &quot;I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I was told, sneeringly, that if I could prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed.&quot;

As late as 1953—just five years before Carey introduced the theory of plate tectonics—the theory of continental drift was rejected by the physicist Scheidegger on the following grounds.
* First, it had been shown that floating masses on a rotating geoid would collect at the equator, and stay there. This would explain one, but only one, mountain building episode between any pair of continents; it failed to account for earlier orogenic episodes.
* Second, masses floating freely in a fluid substratum, like icebergs in the ocean, should be in isostatic equilibrium (in which the forces of gravity and buoyancy are in balance). But gravitational measurements showed that many areas are not in isostatic equilibrium.
* Third, there was the problem of why some parts of the Earth&#x27;s surface (crust) should have solidified while other parts were still fluid. Various attempts to explain this foundered on other difficulties.

=== Road to acceptance ===
From the 1930s to the late 1950s, works by Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, Umbgrove, and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory. In particular, the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea, and in 1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force. Holmes&#x27;s views were particularly influential: in his bestselling textbook, &quot;Principles of Physical Geology,&quot; he included a chapter on continental drift, proposing that Earth&#x27;s mantle contained convection cells which dissipated radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface. Holmes&#x27;s proposal resolved the phase disequilibrium objection (the underlying fluid was kept from solidifying by radioactive heating from the core). However, scientific communication in the 1930s and 1940s was inhibited by World War II, and the theory still required work to avoid foundering on the orogeny and isostasy objections. Worse, the most viable forms of the theory predicted the existence of convection cell boundaries reaching deep into the Earth, that had yet to be observed.

In 1947, a team of scientists led by Maurice Ewing confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the sediments was chemically and physically different from continental crust. As oceanographers continued to bathymeter the ocean basins, a system of mid-oceanic ridges was detected. An important conclusion was that along this system, new ocean floor was being created, which led to the concept of the &quot;Great Global Rift&quot;.

Meanwhile, scientists began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor using devices developed during World War II to detect submarines. Over the next decade, it became increasingly clear that the magnetization patterns were not anomalies, as had been originally supposed. In a series of papers published between 1959 and 1963, Heezen, Dietz, Hess, Mason, Vine, Matthews, and Morley collectively realized that the magnetization of the ocean floor formed extensive, zebra-like patterns: one stripe would exhibit normal polarity and the adjoining stripes reversed polarity. The best explanation was the &quot;conveyor belt&quot; or Vine–Matthews–Morley hypothesis. New magma from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust. The new crust is magnetized by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which undergoes occasional reversals. Formation of new crust then displaces the magnetized crust apart, akin to a conveyor belt – hence the name.

Without workable alternatives to explain the stripes, geophysicists were forced to conclude that Holmes had been right: ocean rifts were sites of perpetual orogeny at the boundaries of convection cells. By 1967, barely two decades after discovery of the mid-oceanic rifts, and a decade after discovery of the striping, plate tectonics had become axiomatic to modern geophysics.

In addition, Marie Tharp, in collaboration with Bruce Heezen, who was initially sceptical of Tharp&#x27;s observations that her maps confirmed continental drift theory, provided essential corroboration, using her skills in cartography and seismographic data, to confirm the theory.

====Modern evidence====
Geophysicist Jack Oliver is credited with providing seismologic evidence supporting plate tectonics which encompassed and superseded continental drift with the article &quot;Seismology and the New Global Tectonics&quot;, published in 1968, using data collected from seismologic stations, including those he set up in the South Pacific. The modern theory of plate tectonics, refining Wegener, explains that there are two kinds of crust of different composition: continental crust and oceanic crust, both floating above a much deeper &quot;plastic&quot; mantle. Continental crust is inherently lighter. Oceanic crust is created at spreading centers, and this, along with subduction, drives the system of plates in a chaotic manner, resulting in continuous orogeny and areas of isostatic imbalance.

Evidence for the movement of continents on tectonic plates is now extensive. Similar plant and animal fossils are found around the shores of different continents, suggesting that they were once joined. The fossils of &quot;Mesosaurus&quot;, a freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile, found both in Brazil and South Africa, are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land reptile &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; in rocks of the same age at locations in Africa, India, and Antarctica. There is also living evidence, with the same animals being found on two continents. Some earthworm families (such as Ocnerodrilidae, Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae) are found in South America and Africa.

The complementary arrangement of the facing sides of South America and Africa is an obvious and temporary coincidence. In millions of years, slab pull, ridge-push, and other forces of tectonophysics will further separate and rotate those two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted.

The widespread distribution of Permo-Carboniferous glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented glacial striations and deposits called tillites, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents&#x27; current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.
====GPS evidence====
In measuring continental drift with GPS relative to some other locations whose positions were measured by GPS, a GPS device located in Maui, Hawaii moved about 48 cm latitudinally and about 84 cm longitudinally during a time of 14 years.

<text>Commodores, often billed as The Commodores, is an American funk and soul group. The group&#x27;s most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Lionel Richie was the co-lead singer.

The members of the group met as mostly freshmen at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in 1968, and signed with Motown in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for the Jackson 5 while on tour.

The band&#x27;s biggest hit singles are ballads such as &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Three Times a Lady&quot;, and &quot;Nightshift&quot;; and funk-influenced dance songs, including &quot;Brick House&quot;, &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot;, &quot;Lady (You Bring Me Up)&quot;, and &quot;Too Hot ta Trot&quot;. 

Commodores were inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame. The band has also won one Grammy Award out of nine nominations. The Commodores have sold over 70 million albums worldwide.

==History==
Commodores were formed from two former student groups: the Mystics and the Jays. Richie described some members of the Mystics as &quot;jazz buffs&quot;. The new six-man band featured Lionel Richie, Thomas McClary, and William King from the Mystics, and Andre Callahan, Michael Gilbert, and Milan Williams from the Jays. They chose their present name when King flipped open a dictionary and ran his finger down the page. &quot;We lucked out,&quot; he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to &quot;People&quot; magazine. &quot;We almost became &#x27;The Commodes.&#x27;&quot;

The bandmembers attended Tuskegee University in Alabama. After winning the university&#x27;s annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the famous solo artist). Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve in Vietnam, and was later replaced by drummer Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange, who wrote or co-wrote many of their hits. Lionel Richie and Orange alternated as lead singers. Orange was the lead singer on the Top 10 hits &quot;Brick House&quot; (1977) and &quot;Nightshift&quot; (1985).

The early band was managed by Benny Ashburn, who brought them to his family&#x27;s vacation lodge on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in 1971 and 1972. There, Ashburn test-marketed the group by having them play in parking lots and summer festivals.

&quot;Machine Gun&quot; (1974), the instrumental title track from the band&#x27;s debut album, became a staple at American sporting events, and is also heard in many films, including &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;. It reached No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1974. Another 1974 song &quot;I Feel Sanctified&quot; has been called a &quot;prototype&quot; of Wild Cherry&#x27;s 1976 big hit &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;. Of the three albums released in 1975 and 1976, &quot;Caught in the Act&quot; was funk album, but &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;Hot on the Tracks&quot; were pop albums. After those recordings the group developed the mellower sound hinted at in their 1976 top-ten hits, &quot;Sweet Love&quot; and &quot;Just to Be Close to You&quot;. In 1977, the Commodores released &quot;Easy&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the US, followed by funky single &quot;Brick House&quot;, also top 5, both from their album &quot;Commodores&quot;, as was &quot;Zoom&quot;. The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with &quot;Three Times a Lady&quot;. In 1979, the Commodores scored another top-five ballad, &quot;Sail On&quot;, before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, &quot;Still&quot;. In 1981 they released two top-ten hits with &quot;Oh No&quot; (No. 4) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, &quot;Lady (You Bring Me Up)&quot; (No. 8).

Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot;. They performed the song &quot;Too Hot ta Trot&quot; during the dance contest; the songs &quot;Brick House&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot; were also played in the movie

In 1982, the group decided to take a hiatus from touring and recording, during which time Lionel Richie recorded a solo album at the suggestion of Motown and the other group members. Its success encouraged Richie to pursue a solo career, and Skyler Jett replaced him as co-lead singer. Also in 1982, Ashburn died of a heart attack at the age of 54.

Founding member McClary left in 1984 (shortly after Richie) to pursue a solo career, and to develop a gospel music company. McClary was replaced by guitarist-vocalist Sheldon Reynolds. Then LaPread left in 1986 and moved to Auckland, New Zealand. Reynolds departed for Earth, Wind &amp; Fire in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William &quot;WAK&quot; King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989 after allegedly refusing to tour South Africa.

The group gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena. In 1984, former Heatwave singer James Dean &quot;J.D.&quot; Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange. That line-up was hitless until 1985 when their final Motown album &quot;Nightshift&quot;, produced by Dennis Lambert (prior albums were produced by James Anthony Carmichael, who would continue to work with Richie on his albums), delivered the title track &quot;Nightshift&quot;, a loving tribute to Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson, both of whom had died the previous year. &quot;Nightshift&quot; hit no. 3 in the US and won the Commodores their first Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals in 1985.

In 2010 a new version was recorded, dedicated to Michael Jackson. The Commodores were on a European tour performing at Wembley Arena, London, on June 25, 2009, when they walked off the stage after they were told that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at Birmingham&#x27;s NIA Arena, J.D. Nicholas added Jackson&#x27;s name to the lyrics of the song, and henceforth the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&amp;B singers. Thus came the inspiration upon the first anniversary of Jackson&#x27;s death to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song &quot;Nightshift&quot; as a tribute.

In 1990, they formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as &quot;Commodores Hits Vol. I &amp; II&quot;. They have recorded a live album, &quot;Commodores Live&quot;, along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled &quot;Commodores Christmas&quot;. In 2012, the band was working on new material, with some contributions written by current and former members.

Commodores as of 2020 consist of Walter &quot;Clyde&quot; Orange, James Dean &quot;J.D.&quot; Nicholas, and William &quot;WAK&quot; King, along with their five-piece band The Mean Machine.They continue to perform, playing at arenas, theaters, and festivals around the world.

<doc id="6058" wikidata="Q26868" url="?curid=6058" title="Collagen">
<text>Collagen () is the main structural protein in the extracellular matrix of the connective tissues of many animals. It is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up 25% to 35% of protein content. Amino acids are bound together to form a triple helix of elongated fibril known as a collagen helix. It is mostly found in cartilage, bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin. Vitamin C is vital for collagen synthesis, while Vitamin E improves its production.

Depending on the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone) or compliant (tendon) or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). Collagen is also abundant in corneas, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen constitutes 1% to 2% of muscle tissue and 6% by weight of skeletal muscle. The fibroblast is the most common cell creating collagen in animals. Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that was irreversibly hydrolyzed using heat, basic solutions, or weak acids.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;collagen&quot; comes from the Greek (&quot;kólla&quot;), meaning &quot;glue&quot;, and suffix -γέν, &quot;-gen&quot;, denoting &quot;producing&quot;.

==Types==
As of 2011, 28 types of human collagen have been identified, described, and classified according to their structure. This diversity shows collagen&#x27;s diverse functionality. All of the types contain at least one triple helix. Over 90% of the collagen in humans is type I &amp; III collagen.
* Fibrillar (type I, II, III, V, XI)
* Non-fibrillar
** FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) (types IX, XII, XIV, XIX, XXI)
** Short-chain (types VIII, X)
** Basement membrane (type IV)
** Multiplexin (multiple triple helix domains with interruptions) (types XV, XVIII)
** MACIT (membrane-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) (types XIII, XVII)
** Microfibril-forming (type VI)
** Anchoring fibrils (type VII)

The five most common types are:
* Type I: skin, tendon, vasculature, organs, bone (main component of the organic part of bone)
* Type II: cartilage (main collagenous component of cartilage)
* Type III: reticulate (main component of reticular fibers), commonly found alongside type I
* Type IV: forms basal lamina, the epithelium-secreted layer of the basement membrane
* Type V: cell surfaces, hair, and placenta

==In humans==
===Cardiac===
The collagenous cardiac skeleton, which includes the four heart valve rings, is histologically, elastically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. The cardiac skeleton also includes the separating septa of the heart chambers – the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular septum. Collagen contribution to the measure of cardiac performance summarily represents a continuous torsional force opposed to the fluid mechanics of blood pressure emitted from the heart. The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable membrane that excludes both blood and electrical impulses through typical physiological means. With support from collagen, atrial fibrillation never deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation. Collagen is layered in variable densities with smooth muscle mass. The mass, distribution, age, and density of collagen all contribute to the compliance required to move blood back and forth. Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are folded into shape by specialized collagen under variable pressure. Gradual calcium deposition within collagen occurs as a natural function of aging. Calcified points within collagen matrices show contrast in a moving display of blood and muscle, enabling methods of cardiac imaging technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in (cardiac input) and blood out (cardiac output). Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is understood within the category of connective tissue disease.

===Bone grafts===
As the skeleton forms the structure of the body, it is vital that it maintains its strength, even after breaks and injuries. Collagen is used in bone grafting because its triple-helix structure makes it a very strong molecule. It is ideal for use in bones, as it does not compromise the structural integrity of the skeleton. The triple helical structure prevents collagen from being broken down by enzymes, it enables adhesiveness of cells and it is important for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix.

===Tissue regeneration===
Collagen scaffolds are used in tissue regeneration, whether in sponges, thin sheets, gels, or fibers. Collagen has favorable properties for tissue regeneration, such as pore structure, permeability, hydrophilicity, and stability in vivo. Collagen scaffolds also support deposition of cells, such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts, and once inserted, facilitate growth to proceed normally.

===Reconstructive surgery===
Collagens are widely used in the construction of artificial skin substitutes used for managing severe burns and wounds. These collagens may be derived from cow, horse, pig, or even human sources; and are sometimes used in combination with silicones, glycosaminoglycans, fibroblasts, growth factors and other substances.

=== Wound healing ===

Collagen is one of the body&#x27;s key natural resources and a component of skin tissue that can benefit all stages of wound healing. When collagen is made available to the wound bed, closure can occur. This avoids wound deterioration and procedures such as amputation.

Collagen is used as a natural wound dressing because it has properties that artificial wound dressings do not have. It resists bacteria, which is vitally important in wound dressing. As a burn dressing, collagen helps it heal fast by helping granulation tissue to grow over the burn.

Throughout the four phases of wound healing, collagen performs the following functions:
* Guiding: collagen fibers guide fibroblasts because they migrate along a connective tissue matrix.
* Chemotaxis: collagen fibers have a large surface area which attracts fibrogenic cells which help healing.
* Nucleation: in the presence of certain neutral salt molecules, collagen can act as a nucleating agent causing formation of fibrillar structures.
* Hemostasis: Blood platelets interact with the collagen to make a hemostatic plug.

==Use in basic research==
Collagen is used in laboratory studies for cell culture, studying cell behavior and cellular interactions with the extracellular environment. Collagen is also widely used as a bioink for 3D bioprinting and biofabrication of 3D tissue models.

==Biology==
The collagen protein is composed of a triple helix, which generally consists of two identical chains (α1) and an additional chain that differs slightly in its chemical composition (α2). The amino acid composition of collagen is atypical for proteins, particularly with respect to its high hydroxyproline content. The most common motifs in collagen&#x27;s amino acid sequence are glycine-proline-X and glycine-X-hydroxyproline, where X is any amino acid other than glycine, proline or hydroxyproline.

The table below lists average amino acid composition for fish and mammal skin.

==Synthesis==

First, a three-dimensional stranded structure is assembled, mostly composed of the amino acids glycine and proline. This is the collagen precursor procollagen. Then, procollagen is modified by the addition of hydroxyl groups to the amino acids proline and lysine. This step is important for later glycosylation and the formation of collagen&#x27;s triple helix structure. Because the hydroxylase enzymes performing these reactions require vitamin C as a cofactor, a long-term deficiency in this vitamin results in impaired collagen synthesis and scurvy. These hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. The reaction consumes one ascorbate molecule per hydroxylation. Collagen synthesis occurs inside and outside cells. 

The most common form of collagen is fibrillary collagen. Another common form is meshwork collagen, which is often involved in the formation of filtration systems. All types of collagen are triple helices, but differ in the make-up of their alpha peptides created in step 2. Below we discuss the formation of fibrillary collagen.
# Transcription of mRNA: Synthesis begins with turning on genes associated with the formation of a particular alpha peptide (typically alpha 1, 2 or 3). About 44 genes are associated with collagen formation, each coding for a specific mRNA sequence, and are typically named with the &quot;COL&quot; prefix.
# Pre-pro-peptide formation: The created mRNA exits the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. There, it links with the ribosomal subunits and is translated into a peptide. The peptide goes into the endoplasmic reticulum for post-translational processing. It is directed there by a signal recognition particle on the endoplasmic reticulum, which recognizes the peptide&#x27;s signal sequence (the early part of the sequence). The processed product is a pre-pro-peptide called preprocollagen.
# Pro-collagen formation: Three modifications of the pre-pro-peptide form the alpha peptide:
## The signal peptide on the N-terminal is removed. The molecule is now called &quot;propeptide.&quot;
## Lysines and prolines are hydroxylated by the enzymes &#x27;prolyl hydroxylase&#x27; and &#x27;lysyl hydroxylase&#x27;, producing hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. This helps in cross-linking the alpha peptides. This enzymatic step requires vitamin C as a cofactor. In scurvy, the lack of hydroxylation of prolines and lysines causes a looser triple helix (which is formed by three alpha peptides).
## Glycosylation occurs by adding either glucose or galactose monomers onto the hydroxyl groups that were placed onto lysines, but not on prolines.
## Three of the hydroxylated and glycosylated propeptides twist into a triple helix (except for its ends), forming procollagen. It is packaged into a transfer vesicle destined for the Golgi apparatus.
# Modification and secretion: In the Golgi apparatus, the procollagen goes through one last post-translational modification, adding oligosaccharides (not monosaccharides as in step 3). Then it is packaged into a secretory vesicle to be secreted from the cell.
# Tropocollagen formation: Outside the cell, membrane-bound enzymes called collagen peptidases remove the unwound ends of the molecule, producing tropocollagen. Defects in this step produce various collagenopathies called Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. This step is absent when synthesizing type III, a type of fibrillar collagen.
# Collagen fibril formation: Lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, acts on lysines and hydroxylysines, producing aldehyde groups, which eventually form covalent bonds between tropocollagen molecules. This polymer of tropocollagen is called a collagen fibril.

===Amino acids===
Collagen has an unusual amino acid composition and sequence:
* Glycine is found at almost every third residue.
* Proline makes up about 17% of collagen.
* Collagen contains two unusual derivative amino acids not directly inserted during translation. These amino acids are found at specific locations relative to glycine and are modified post-translationally by different enzymes, both of which require vitamin C as a cofactor.
** Hydroxyproline derived from proline
** Hydroxylysine derived from lysine – depending on the type of collagen, varying numbers of hydroxylysines are glycosylated (mostly having disaccharides attached).

Cortisol stimulates degradation of (skin) collagen into amino acids.

=== Collagen I formation ===
Most collagen forms in a similar manner, but the following process is typical for type I:

# Inside the cell
## Two types of alpha chains – alpha-1 and alpha 2, are formed during translation on ribosomes along the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These peptide chains known as preprocollagen, have registration peptides on each end and a signal peptide.
## Polypeptide chains are released into the lumen of the RER.
## Signal peptides are cleaved inside the RER and the chains are now known as pro-alpha chains.
## Hydroxylation of lysine and proline amino acids occurs inside the lumen. This process is dependent on and consumes ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a cofactor.
## Glycosylation of specific hydroxylysine residues occurs.
## Triple alpha helical structure is formed inside the endoplasmic reticulum from two alpha-1 chains and one alpha-2 chain.
## Procollagen is shipped to the Golgi apparatus, where it is packaged and secreted into extracellular space by exocytosis.
# Outside the cell
## Registration peptides are cleaved and tropocollagen is formed by procollagen peptidase.
## Multiple tropocollagen molecules form collagen fibrils, via covalent cross-linking (aldol reaction) by lysyl oxidase which links hydroxylysine and lysine residues. Multiple collagen fibrils form into collagen fibers.
## Collagen may be attached to cell membranes via several types of protein, including fibronectin, laminin, fibulin and integrin.

==Molecular structure==

A single collagen molecule, tropocollagen, is used to make up larger collagen aggregates, such as fibrils. It is approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter, and it is made up of three polypeptide strands (called alpha peptides, see step 2), each of which has the conformation of a left-handed helix – this should not be confused with the right-handed alpha helix. These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or &quot;super helix&quot;, a cooperative quaternary structure stabilized by many hydrogen bonds. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens, if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.

A distinctive feature of collagen is the regular arrangement of amino acids in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. The sequence often follows the pattern Gly-Pro-X or Gly-X-Hyp, where X may be any of various other amino acid residues. Proline or hydroxyproline constitute about 1/6 of the total sequence. With glycine accounting for the 1/3 of the sequence, this means approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline or hydroxyproline, a fact often missed due to the distraction of the unusual GX1X2 character of collagen alpha-peptides. The high glycine content of collagen is important with respect to stabilization of the collagen helix as this allows the very close association of the collagen fibers within the molecule, facilitating hydrogen bonding and the formation of intermolecular cross-links. This kind of regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only a few other fibrous proteins, such as silk fibroin.

Collagen is not only a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation, and infrastructure, many sections of its non-proline-rich regions have cell or matrix association/regulation roles. The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline rings, with their geometrically constrained carboxyl and (secondary) amino groups, along with the rich abundance of glycine, accounts for the tendency of the individual polypeptide strands to form left-handed helices spontaneously, without any intrachain hydrogen bonding.

Because glycine is the smallest amino acid with no side chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins. In collagen, Gly is required at every third position because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycine&#x27;s single hydrogen atom. For the same reason, the rings of the Pro and Hyp must point outward. These two amino acids help stabilize the triple helix – Hyp even more so than Pro; a lower concentration of them is required in animals such as fish, whose body temperatures are lower than most warm-blooded animals. Lower proline and hydroxyproline contents are characteristic of cold-water, but not warm-water fish; the latter tend to have similar proline and hydroxyproline contents to mammals. The lower proline and hydroxyproline contents of cold-water fish and other poikilotherm animals leads to their collagen having a lower thermal stability than mammalian collagen. This lower thermal stability means that gelatin derived from fish collagen is not suitable for many food and industrial applications.

The tropocollagen subunits spontaneously self-assemble, with regularly staggered ends, into even larger arrays in the extracellular spaces of tissues. Additional assembly of fibrils is guided by fibroblasts, which deposit fully formed fibrils from fibripositors. In the fibrillar collagens, molecules are staggered to adjacent molecules by about 67 nm (a unit that is referred to as &#x27;D&#x27; and changes depending upon the hydration state of the aggregate). In each D-period repeat of the microfibril, there is a part containing five molecules in cross-section, called the &quot;overlap&quot;, and a part containing only four molecules, called the &quot;gap&quot;. These overlap and gap regions are retained as microfibrils assemble into fibrils, and are thus viewable using electron microscopy. The triple helical tropocollagens in the microfibrils are arranged in a quasihexagonal packing pattern.

There is some covalent crosslinking within the triple helices and a variable amount of covalent crosslinking between tropocollagen helices forming well-organized aggregates (such as fibrils). Larger fibrillar bundles are formed with the aid of several different classes of proteins (including different collagen types), glycoproteins, and proteoglycans to form the different types of mature tissues from alternate combinations of the same key players. Collagen&#x27;s insolubility was a barrier to the study of monomeric collagen until it was found that tropocollagen from young animals can be extracted because it is not yet fully crosslinked. However, advances in microscopy techniques (i.e. electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)) and X-ray diffraction have enabled researchers to obtain increasingly detailed images of collagen structure &quot;in situ&quot;. These later advances are particularly important to better understanding the way in which collagen structure affects cell–cell and cell–matrix communication and how tissues are constructed in growth and repair and changed in development and disease. For example, using AFM–based nanoindentation it has been shown that a single collagen fibril is a heterogeneous material along its axial direction with significantly different mechanical properties in its gap and overlap regions, correlating with its different molecular organizations in these two regions.

Collagen fibrils/aggregates are arranged in different combinations and concentrations in various tissues to provide varying tissue properties. In bone, entire collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array. 40 nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits (approximately equal to the gap region) probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of long, hard, fine crystals of the mineral component, which is hydroxylapatite (approximately) Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6. Type I collagen gives bone its tensile strength.

==Associated disorders==

Collagen-related diseases most commonly arise from genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies that affect the biosynthesis, assembly, posttranslational modification, secretion, or other processes involved in normal collagen production.

In addition to the above-mentioned disorders, excessive deposition of collagen occurs in scleroderma.

==Diseases==
One thousand mutations have been identified in 12 out of more than 20 types of collagen. These mutations can lead to various diseases at the tissue level.

Osteogenesis imperfecta – Caused by a mutation in &quot;type 1 collagen&quot;, dominant autosomal disorder, results in weak bones and irregular connective tissue, some cases can be mild while others can be lethal. Mild cases have lowered levels of collagen type 1 while severe cases have structural defects in collagen.

Chondrodysplasias – Skeletal disorder believed to be caused by a mutation in &quot;type 2 collagen&quot;, further research is being conducted to confirm this.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome – Thirteen different types of this disorder, which lead to deformities in connective tissue, are known. Some of the rarer types can be lethal, leading to the rupture of arteries. Each syndrome is caused by a different mutation. For example, the vascular type (vEDS) of this disorder is caused by a mutation in &quot;collagen type 3&quot;.

Alport syndrome – Can be passed on genetically, usually as X-linked dominant, but also as both an autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disorder, those with the condition have problems with their kidneys and eyes, loss of hearing can also develop during the childhood or adolescent years.

Knobloch syndrome – Caused by a mutation in the COL18A1 gene that codes for the production of collagen XVIII. Patients present with protrusion of the brain tissue and degeneration of the retina; an individual who has family members with the disorder is at an increased risk of developing it themselves since there is a hereditary link.

==Animal harvesting==
When not synthesized, collagen can be harvested from animal skin. This has led to deforestation as has occurred in Paraguay where large collagen producers buy large amounts of cattle hides from regions that have been clear-cut for cattle grazing.

==Characteristics==
Collagen is one of the long, fibrous structural proteins whose functions are quite different from those of globular proteins, such as enzymes. Tough bundles of collagen called &quot;collagen fibers&quot; are a major component of the extracellular matrix that supports most tissues and gives cells structure from the outside, but collagen is also found inside certain cells. Collagen has great tensile strength, and is the main component of fascia, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bone and skin. Along with elastin and soft keratin, it is responsible for skin strength and elasticity, and its degradation leads to wrinkles that accompany aging. It strengthens blood vessels and plays a role in tissue development. It is present in the cornea and lens of the eye in crystalline form. It may be one of the most abundant proteins in the fossil record, given that it appears to fossilize frequently, even in bones from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.

=== Mechanical properties ===
Collagen is a complex hierarchical material with mechanical properties that vary significantly across different scales.

On the molecular scale, atomistic and course-grained modeling simulations, as well as numerous experimental methods, have led to several estimates of the Young&#x27;s modulus of collagen at the molecular level. Only above a certain strain rate is there a strong relationship between elastic modulus and strain rate, possibly due to the large number of atoms in a collagen molecule. The length of the molecule is also important, where longer molecules have lower tensile strengths than shorter ones due to short molecules having a large proportion of hydrogen bonds being broken and reformed.

On the fibrillar scale, collagen has a lower modulus compared to the molecular scale, and varies depending on geometry, scale of observation, deformation state, and hydration level. By increasing the crosslink density from zero to 3 per molecule, the maximum stress the fibril can support increases from 0.5 GPa to 6 GPa.

Limited tests have been done on the tensile strength of the collagen fiber, but generally it has been shown to have a lower Young&#x27;s modulus compared to fibrils.

When studying the mechanical properties of collagen, tendon is often chosen as the ideal material because it is close to a pure and aligned collagen structure. However, at the macro, tissue scale, the vast number of structures that collagen fibers and fibrils can be arranged into results in highly variable properties. For example, tendon has primarily parallel fibers, whereas skin consists of a net of wavy fibers, resulting in a much higher strength and lower ductility in tendon compared to skin. The mechanical properties of collagen at multiple hierarchical levels is given.

Collagen is known to be a viscoelastic solid. When the collagen fiber is modeled as two Kelvin-Voigt models in series, each consisting of a spring and a dashpot in parallel, the strain in the fiber can be modeled according to the following equation:

formula_1

where α, β, and γ are defined materials properties, εD is fibrillar strain, and εT is total strain.

===Uses===

Collagen has a wide variety of applications, from food to medical. In the medical industry, it is used in cosmetic surgery and burn surgery. In the food sector, one use example is in casings for sausages.

If collagen is subject to sufficient denaturation, such as by heating, the three tropocollagen strands separate partially or completely into globular domains, containing a different secondary structure to the normal collagen polyproline II (PPII) of random coils. This process describes the formation of gelatin, which is used in many foods, including flavored gelatin desserts. Besides food, gelatin has been used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and photography industries. It is also used as a dietary supplement, and has been advertised as a potential remedy against the ageing process.

From the Greek for glue, &quot;kolla&quot;, the word collagen means &quot;glue producer&quot; and refers to the early process of boiling the skin and sinews of horses and other animals to obtain glue. Collagen adhesive was used by Egyptians about 4,000 years ago, and Native Americans used it in bows about 1,500 years ago. The oldest glue in the world, carbon-dated as more than 8,000 years old, was found to be collagen – used as a protective lining on rope baskets and embroidered fabrics, to hold utensils together, and in crisscross decorations on human skulls. Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to dry conditions. Animal glues are thermoplastic, softening again upon reheating, so they are still used in making musical instruments such as fine violins and guitars, which may have to be reopened for repairs – an application incompatible with tough, synthetic plastic adhesives, which are permanent. Animal sinews and skins, including leather, have been used to make useful articles for millennia.

Gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue (and with formaldehyde replaced by less-toxic pentanedial and ethanedial) has been used to repair experimental incisions in rabbit lungs.

=== Cosmetics ===

Bovine collagen is widely used in dermal fillers for aesthetic correction of wrinkles and skin aging. Collagen cremes are also widely sold even though collagen cannot penetrate the skin because its fibers are too large. Collagen is a vital protein in skin, hair, nails, and other tissues. Its production decreases with age and factors like sun damage and smoking. Collagen supplements, derived from sources like fish and cattle, are marketed to improve skin, hair, and nails. Studies show some skin benefits, but these supplements often contain other beneficial ingredients, making it unclear if collagen alone is effective. There&#x27;s minimal evidence supporting collagen&#x27;s benefits for hair and nails. Overall, the effectiveness of oral collagen supplements is not well-proven, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle and proven skincare methods like sun protection is recommended.

==History==
The molecular and packing structures of collagen eluded scientists over decades of research. The first evidence that it possesses a regular structure at the molecular level was presented in the mid-1930s. Research then concentrated on the conformation of the collagen monomer, producing several competing models, although correctly dealing with the conformation of each individual peptide chain. The triple-helical &quot;Madras&quot; model, proposed by G. N. Ramachandran in 1955, provided an accurate model of quaternary structure in collagen. This model was supported by further studies of higher resolution in the late 20th century.

The packing structure of collagen has not been defined to the same degree outside of the fibrillar collagen types, although it has been long known to be hexagonal. As with its monomeric structure, several conflicting models propose either that the packing arrangement of collagen molecules is &#x27;sheet-like&#x27;, or is microfibrillar. The microfibrillar structure of collagen fibrils in tendon, cornea and cartilage was imaged directly by electron microscopy in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The microfibrillar structure of rat tail tendon was modeled as being closest to the observed structure, although it oversimplified the topological progression of neighboring collagen molecules, and so did not predict the correct conformation of the discontinuous D-periodic pentameric arrangement termed &quot;microfibril&quot;.

<text>Calvin and Hobbes is a daily American comic strip created by cartoonist Bill Watterson that was syndicated from November 18, 1985, to December 31, 1995. Commonly described as &quot;the last great newspaper comic&quot;, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; has enjoyed enduring popularity, influence, and academic and even a philosophical interest.

&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; follows the humorous antics of the title characters: Calvin, a mischievous and adventurous six-year-old boy; and his friend Hobbes, a sardonic tiger. Set in the suburban United States of the 1980s and 1990s, the strip depicts Calvin&#x27;s frequent flights of fancy and friendship with Hobbes. It also examines Calvin&#x27;s relationships with his long-suffering parents and with his classmates, especially his neighbor Susie Derkins. Hobbes&#x27;s dual nature is a defining motif for the strip: to Calvin, Hobbes is a living anthropomorphic tiger, while all the other characters seem to see Hobbes as an inanimate stuffed toy, though Watterson has not clarified exactly how Hobbes is perceived by others, or whether he is real or an imaginary friend. Though the series does not frequently mention specific political figures or ongoing events, it does explore broad issues like environmentalism, public education, and philosophical quandaries.

At the height of its popularity, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide. In 2010, reruns of the strip appeared in more than 50 countries, and nearly 45 million copies of the &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; books have been sold worldwide.

== History ==
=== Development ===

&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was conceived when Bill Watterson, while working in an advertising job he detested, began devoting his spare time to developing a newspaper comic for potential syndication. He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip called &quot;The Doghouse&quot;, which featured a side character (the main character&#x27;s little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. United identified these characters as the strongest and encouraged Watterson to develop them as the center of their own strip. Though United Feature ultimately rejected the new strip as lacking in marketing potential, Universal Press Syndicate took it up.

=== Launch and early success (1985–1990) ===
The first &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strip was published on November 18, 1985 in 35 newspapers. The strip quickly became popular. Within a year of syndication, the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers and proved to have international appeal with translation and wide circulation outside the United States.

Although &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; underwent continual artistic development and creative innovation over the period of syndication, the earliest strips demonstrated a remarkable consistency with the latest. Watterson introduced all the major characters within the first three weeks and made no changes to the central cast over the strip&#x27;s 10-year history. 

By April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated another time in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988. &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; has also won several more awards.

As his creation grew in popularity, there was strong interest from the syndicate to merchandise the characters and expand into other forms of media. Watterson&#x27;s contract with the syndicate allowed the characters to be licensed without the creator&#x27;s consent, as was standard at the time. Nevertheless, Watterson had leverage by threatening to simply walk away from the comic strip.

This dynamic played out in a long and emotionally draining battle between Watterson and his syndicate editors. By 1991, Watterson had achieved his goal of securing a new contract that granted him legal control over his creation and all future licensing arrangements.

=== Creative control (1991–1995) ===
Having achieved his objective of creative control, Watterson&#x27;s desire for privacy subsequently reasserted itself and he ceased all media interviews, relocated to New Mexico, and largely disappeared from public engagements, refusing to attend the ceremonies of any of the cartooning awards he won. The pressures of the battle over merchandising led to Watterson taking an extended break from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, a move that was virtually unprecedented in the world of syndicated cartoonists.
During Watterson&#x27;s first sabbatical from the strip, Universal Press Syndicate continued to charge newspapers full price to re-run old &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strips. Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had no choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away. Watterson returned to the strip in 1992 with plans to produce his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or tabloid page. This made him only the second cartoonist since Garry Trudeau to have sufficient popularity to demand more space and control over the presentation of his work.

Watterson took a second sabbatical from April 3 through December 31, 1994. His return came with an announcement that &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; would be concluding at the end of 1995. Stating his belief that he had achieved everything that he wanted to within the medium, he announced his intention to work on future projects at a slower pace with fewer artistic compromises.

The final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995, depicting Calvin and Hobbes sledding down a snowy hill after a fresh snowfall with Calvin exclaiming &quot;Let&#x27;s go exploring!&quot;

Speaking to NPR in 2005, animation critic Charles Solomon opined that the final strip &quot;left behind a hole in the comics page that no strip has been able to fill.&quot;

==Sunday formatting==

Syndicated comics were typically published six times a week in black and white, with a Sunday supplement version in a larger, full color format. This larger format version of the strip was constrained by mandatory layout requirements that made it possible for newspaper editors to format the strip for different page sizes and layouts.

Watterson grew increasingly frustrated by the shrinking of the available space for comics in the newspapers and the mandatory panel divisions that restricted his ability to produce better artwork and more creative storytelling. He felt that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.

Watterson longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as &quot;Little Nemo&quot; and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and in 1989 he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, &quot;The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book—&quot;an 8-page previously unpublished Calvin story fully illustrated in watercolor. The same book contained an afterword from the artist himself, reflecting on a time when comic strips were allocated a whole page of the newspaper and every comic was like a &quot;color poster&quot;.

Within two years, Watterson was ultimately successful in negotiating a deal that provided him more space and creative freedom. Following his 1991 sabbatical, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or tabloid page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists including Bil Keane (&quot;The Family Circus&quot;) and Bruce Beattie (&quot;Snafu&quot;) criticized him for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business. Others, including Bill Amend (&quot;Foxtrot&quot;), Johnny Hart (&quot;BC&quot;, &quot;Wizard of Id&quot;) and Barbara Brandon (&quot;Where I&#x27;m Coming From&quot;) supported him. The American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors even formally requested that Universal reconsider the changes. Watterson&#x27;s own comments on the matter was that &quot;editors will have to judge for themselves whether or not Calvin and Hobbes deserves the extra space. If they don&#x27;t think the strip carries its own weight, they don&#x27;t have to run it.&quot; Ultimately only 15 newspapers cancelled the strip in response to the layout changes.

==Sabbaticals==
Bill Watterson took two sabbaticals from the daily requirements of producing the strip. The first took place from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, and the second from April 3 through December 31, 1994. These sabbaticals were included in the new contract Watterson managed to negotiate with Universal Features in 1990. The sabbaticals were proposed by the syndicate themselves, who, fearing Watterson&#x27;s complete burnout, endeavored to get another five years of work from their star artist.

Watterson remains only the third cartoonist with sufficient popularity and stature to receive a sabbatical from their syndicate, the first two being Garry Trudeau (&quot;Doonesbury&quot;) in 1983 and Gary Larson (&quot;The Far Side&quot;) in 1989. Typically, cartoonists are expected to produce sufficient strips to cover any period that they may wish to take off. Watterson&#x27;s lengthy sabbaticals received some mild criticism from his fellow cartoonists including Greg Evans (&quot;Luann&quot;), and Charles Schulz (&quot;Peanuts&quot;), one of Watterson&#x27;s major artistic influences, who even called it a &quot;puzzle&quot;. Some cartoonists resented the idea that Watterson worked harder than others, while others supported it. At least one newspaper editor noted that the strip was the most popular in the country and stated that he &quot;earned it&quot;.

==Merchandising==
&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; had almost no official product merchandising. Watterson held that comic strips should stand on their own as an art form and although he did not start out completely opposed to merchandising in all forms (or even for all comic strips), he did reject an early syndication deal that involved incorporating a more marketable, licensed character into his strip. In spite of being an unproven cartoonist, and having been flown all the way to New York to discuss the proposal, Watterson reflexively resented the idea of &quot;cartooning by committee&quot; and turned it down.

When &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was accepted by Universal Syndicate, and began to grow in popularity, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused, believing that the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by commercialization, which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art, and that licensing his character would only violate the spirit of his work. He gave an example of this in discussing his opposition to a Hobbes plush toy: that if the essence of Hobbes&#x27; nature in the strip is that it remain unresolved whether he is a real tiger or a stuffed toy, then creating a real stuffed toy would only destroy the magic. However, having initially signed away control over merchandising in his initial contract with the syndicate, Watterson commenced a lengthy and emotionally draining battle with Universal to gain control over his work. Ultimately Universal did not approve any products against Watterson&#x27;s wishes, understanding that, unlike other comic strips, it would be nearly impossible to separate the creator from the strip if Watterson chose to walk away.

One estimate places the value of licensing revenue forgone by Watterson at $300–$400 million. Almost no legitimate &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; merchandise exists. Exceptions produced during the strip&#x27;s original run include two 16-month calendars (1988–89 and 1989–90), a t-shirt for the Smithsonian Exhibit, &quot;Great American Comics: 100 Years of Cartoon Art&quot; (1990) and the textbook &quot;Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, which has been described as &quot;perhaps the most difficult piece of official &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; memorabilia to find.&quot; In 2010, Watterson did allow his characters to be included in a series of United States Postal Service stamps honoring five classic American comics. Licensed prints of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; were made available and have also been included in various academic works.

The strip&#x27;s immense popularity has led to the appearance of various counterfeit items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature crude humor, binge drinking and other themes that are not found in Watterson&#x27;s work. Images from one strip in which Calvin and Hobbes dance to loud music at night were commonly used for copyright violations. After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes. Watterson wryly commented, &quot;I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a Ford logo,&quot; but later added, &quot;long after the strip is forgotten, [they] are my ticket to immortality&quot;.

===Animation===
Watterson has expressed admiration for animation as an artform. In a 1989 interview in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; he described the appeal of being able to do things with a moving image that cannot be done by a simple drawing: the distortion, the exaggeration and the control over the length of time an event is viewed. However, although the visual possibilities of animation appealed to Watterson, the idea of finding a voice for Calvin made him uncomfortable, as did the idea of working with a team of animators. Ultimately, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was never made into an animated series. Watterson later stated in &quot;The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book&quot; that he liked the fact that his strip was a &quot;low-tech, one-man operation,&quot; and that he took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own. Calls from major Hollywood figures interested in an adaptation of his work, including Jim Henson, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, were never returned and in a 2013 interview Watterson stated that he had &quot;zero interest&quot; in an animated adaptation as there was really no upside for him in doing so.

==Style and influences==
The strip borrows several elements and themes from three major influences: Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson&#x27;s outlook on comics during his formative years.

Elements of Watterson&#x27;s artistic style are his characters&#x27; diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin&#x27;s flights of imagination, expressions of motion and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue and greater use of white space. He also experimented with his tools, once inking a strip with a stick from his yard in order to achieve a particular look. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the &quot;Noodle Incident&quot; and the children&#x27;s book &quot;Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie&quot; are left to the reader&#x27;s imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be &quot;more outrageous&quot; than he could portray.

== Production and technique ==

Watterson&#x27;s technique started with minimalist pencil sketches drawn with a light pencil (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work) on a piece of Bristol board, with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands (Watterson said he initially used any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results). He would then use a small sable brush and India ink to fill in the rest of the drawing, saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous. He lettered dialogue with a Rapidograph fountain pen, and he used a crowquill pen for odds and ends. Mistakes were covered with various forms of correction fluid, including the type used on typewriters. Watterson was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares, lay out the colors, and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on. When &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.

==Characters==

In addition to the two titular characters, six-year-old Calvin and his stuffed tiger Hobbes, the strip features a small recurring cast that also includes Calvin&#x27;s unnamed parents, his dad&#x27;s brother, his classmate and neighbor Susie Derkins, his teacher Miss Wormwood, his school bully Moe, and his babysitter Rosalyn.

==Recurring elements and themes==
===Art and academia===
Watterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin&#x27;s unconventional creations of snowmen but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself &quot;on the cutting edge of the &quot;avant-garde&quot;.&quot; He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman. His next sculpture &quot;speaks to the horror of our own mortality, inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life.&quot; In later strips, Calvin&#x27;s creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings (or, as he terms them, examples of &quot;suburban postmodernism&quot;).

Watterson also lampooned the academic world. In one example, Calvin carefully crafts an &quot;artist&#x27;s statement&quot;, claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do (Hobbes blandly notes, &quot;You misspelled &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;&quot;). He indulges in what Watterson calls &quot;pop psychobabble&quot; to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents, citing &quot;toxic codependency.&quot; In one instance, he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to &quot;inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning and inhibit clarity,&quot; entitled &quot;The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in Dick and Jane: A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes&quot;. Displaying his creation to Hobbes, he remarks, &quot;Academia, here I come!&quot; Watterson explains that he adapted this jargon (and similar examples from several other strips) from an actual book of art criticism.

Overall, Watterson&#x27;s satirical essays serve to attack both sides, criticizing both the commercial mainstream and the artists who are supposed to be &quot;outside&quot; it. The strip on Sunday, June 21, 1992, criticized the naming of the Big Bang theory as not evocative of the wonders behind it and coined the term &quot;Horrendous Space Kablooie&quot;, an alternative that achieved some informal popularity among scientists and was often shortened to &quot;the HSK&quot;. The term has also been referred to in newspapers, books and university courses.

===Calvin&#x27;s alter-egos===
Calvin imagines himself as many great creatures and other people, including dinosaurs, elephants, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his alter egos are well-defined and recurrent:
*&quot;Spaceman Spiff&quot; is a heroic spacefarer who narrates his adventures in the third person. As Spiff, Calvin battles aliens (typically his parents or teacher, but also sometimes other kids his age) with a ray gun known as a &quot;zorcher&quot; (later &quot;frap-ray blaster&quot;, &quot;death ray blaster&quot; or &quot;atomic napalm neutralizer&quot;) and travels to distant planets (his house, school or neighborhood), often crashing unhurt on a planet. Calvin&#x27;s self-narration as Spaceman Spiff is frequently riddled with alliteration: &quot;Zounds! Zorched by Zarches, Spaceman Spiff&#x27;s crippled craft crashes on planet Plootarg!&quot; Watterson has stated the idea of Spaceman Spiff came from an earlier attempt as a cartoon, and is meant as a parody of Flash Gordon. The canyons and deserts that many of the Spaceman Spiff stories are set in are based on the landscapes of southern Utah.
* &quot;Tracer Bullet&quot; is a hardboiled private eye, who says he has eight slugs in him (&quot;One&#x27;s lead, and the rest are bourbon.&quot;). In one story, Bullet is called to a case in which a &quot;pushy dame&quot; (Calvin&#x27;s mother) accuses him of destroying an expensive lamp (broken during an indoor football game between Calvin and Hobbes). Later, he is snatched by the pushy dame&#x27;s &quot;hired goon&quot; (Calvin&#x27;s father having a talk with him). In another, he &quot;investigates&quot; a math word problem during class, &quot;closing the case&quot; with an answer of 1,000,000,000 when the correct response was 15. He made his debut when Calvin donned a fedora in order to hide a terrible haircut Hobbes had given him. These strips are drawn in elaborate, shadowy black-and-white that evoke film noir. Watterson did not attempt Tracer Bullet stories often, due to the time-consuming way the strip needed to be drawn and inked.

* &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; is a superhero who wears a mask and a cape (made by Calvin&#x27;s mother) and narrates his own adventures. While Calvin is in character as Stupendous Man, he refers to his alter ego as a mild-mannered millionaire playboy. Stupendous Man almost always &quot;suffers defeat&quot; at the hands of his opponent. When Hobbes asks if Stupendous Man has ever won any battles, Calvin says all his battles are &quot;moral victories.&quot; Stupendous Man&#x27;s nemeses include &quot;Mom-Lady&quot; (Calvin&#x27;s mom), &quot;Annoying Girl&quot; (Susie Derkins), &quot;Crab Teacher&quot; (Miss Wormwood) and &quot;Baby-Sitter Girl&quot; (Rosalyn). Some of the &quot;super powers&quot; of the villains have been revealed: Mom-Lady has a &quot;mind scrambling eyeball ray&quot; that wills the victim to &quot;do her nefarious bidding&quot;; and Baby Sitter Girl has a similar power of using a &quot;psycho beam&quot; which weakens &quot;Stupendous Man&#x27;s stupendous will&quot;. The &quot;powers&quot; of Annoying Girl and Crab Teacher are never revealed. Calvin often tries to pretend he and &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; are two different people, but it fails to work. Stupendous Man has multiple &quot;superpowers&quot;, including, but not limited to, super strength, the ability to fly, various vision powers such as &quot;high-speed vision&quot;, &quot;muscles of magnitude&quot; and a &quot;stomach of steel&quot;.

===Cardboard boxes===
Calvin also has several adventures involving corrugated cardboard boxes, which he adapts for many imaginative and elaborate uses. In one strip, when Calvin shows off his Transmogrifier, a device that transforms its user into any desired creature or item, Hobbes remarks, &quot;It&#x27;s amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.&quot; Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying time machine, a duplicator, a transmogrifier or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a &quot;Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.&quot;

In the real world, Calvin&#x27;s antics with his box have had varying effects. When he transmogrified into a tiger, he still appeared as a regular human child to his parents. However, in a story where he made several duplicates of himself, his parents are seen interacting with what does seem like multiple Calvins, including in a strip where two of him are seen in the same panel as his father. It is ultimately unknown what his parents do or do not see, as Calvin tries to hide most of his creations (or conceal their effects) so as not to traumatize them.

In addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a sidewalk kiosk to sell things. Often, Calvin offers merchandise no one would want, such as &quot;suicide drink&quot;, &quot;a swift kick in the butt&quot; for one dollar or a &quot;frank appraisal of your looks&quot; for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells &quot;happiness&quot; for ten cents, hitting the customer in the face with a water balloon and explaining that he meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold &quot;insurance&quot;, firing a slingshot at those who refused to buy it. In some strips, he tried to sell &quot;great ideas&quot; and, in one earlier strip, he attempted to sell the family car to obtain money for a grenade launcher. In yet another strip, he sells &quot;life&quot; for five cents, where the customer receives nothing in return, which, in Calvin&#x27;s opinion, is life.

The box has also functioned as an alternate secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the &quot;Box of Secrecy&quot;.
===Calvinball===

Calvinball is an improvisational sport/game introduced in a 1990 storyline that involved Calvin&#x27;s negative experience of joining the school baseball team. Calvinball is a nomic or self-modifying game, a contest of wits, skill and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill. The game is portrayed as a rebellion against conventional team sports and became a staple of the final five years of the comic. The only consistent rules of the game are that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice and that each participant must wear a mask.

When asked how to play, Watterson stated: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty simple: you make up the rules as you go.&quot; In most appearances of the game, a comical array of conventional and non-conventional sporting equipment is involved, including a croquet set, a badminton set, assorted flags, bags, signs, a hobby horse, water buckets and balloons, with humorous allusions to unseen elements such as &quot;time-fracture wickets&quot;. Scoring is portrayed as arbitrary and nonsensical (&quot;Q to 12&quot; and &quot;oogy to boogy&quot;) and the lack of fixed rules leads to lengthy argument between the participants as to who scored, where the boundaries are, and when the game is finished. Usually, the contest results in Calvin being outsmarted by Hobbes. The game has been described in one academic work not as a new game based on fragments of an older one, but as the &quot;constant connecting and disconnecting of parts, the constant evasion of rules or guidelines based on collective creativity.&quot;

===Snowmen and other snow art===

Calvin often creates horrendous/dark humor scenes with his snowmen and other snow sculptures. He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating snow cones scooped out of a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a &quot;snowman house of horror&quot;; and snowmen representing people he hates. &quot;The ones I &quot;really&quot; hate are small, so they&#x27;ll melt faster,&quot; he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into &quot;deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.&quot;

Calvin&#x27;s snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people&#x27;s snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin&#x27;s willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.

===Wagon and sled rides===
Calvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a wagon or sled (depending on the season), as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, &quot;it&#x27;s a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.&quot; While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip, it also frequently serves as a counterpoint or visual metaphor while Calvin ponders the meaning of life, death, God, philosophy or a variety of other weighty subjects. Many of their rides end in spectacular crashes which leave them battered, beaten up and broken, a fact which convinces Hobbes to sometimes hop off before a ride even begins. In the final strip, Calvin and Hobbes depart on their sled to go exploring. This theme is similar (perhaps even an homage) to scenes in Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;. Calvin and Hobbes&#x27; sled has been described as the most famous sled in American arts since &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

===G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid of Slimy GirlS) ===
G.R.O.S.S. (which is a backronym for Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS, &quot;otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spell anything&quot;) is a club in which Calvin and Hobbes are the only members. The club was founded in the garage of their house, but to clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin&#x27;s parents&#x27; car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident prompts the duo to change the club&#x27;s location to Calvin&#x27;s treehouse. They hold meetings that involve finding ways to annoy and discomfort Susie Derkins, a girl and enemy of their club. Actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being &quot;Dictator-for-Life&quot; and Hobbes being &quot;President-and-First-Tiger&quot;. They go into Calvin&#x27;s treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin&#x27;s plans. As Hobbes is able to climb the tree without the rope, he is usually the one who comes up with the password, which often involves heaping praise upon tigers. An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on &quot;&quot;Verse Seven:&quot; Tigers are perfect!/The E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity&quot;. The opportunity to pelt Susie with something having passed, Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug.

=== Dinosaurs ===
Dinosaurs play a heavy role in many of Calvin&#x27;s imagination sequences. These strips will often begin with hyper-realistic scenes of dinosaur interactions, only to end with a cut to Calvin acting out these scenes as part of a day-dream, often to his embarrassment. Watterson placed a heavy focus on accurately depicting dinosaurs, due to his own interest in them as well as to reinforce how real they are to Calvin.

==Books==

There are 18 &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; books, published from 1987 to 1997. These include 11 collections, which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a single daily strip from November 28, 1985. (The collections &quot;do&quot; contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers.) Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.
Watterson included some new material in the treasuries. In &quot;The Essential Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, which includes cartoons from the collections &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and &quot;Something Under the Bed Is Drooling&quot;, the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town. The scene is based on Watterson&#x27;s home town of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and Calvin is holding the Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop, an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town&#x27;s namesake falls. Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry; &quot;The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes&quot; book features a set of poems, ranging from just a few lines to an entire page, that cover topics such as Calvin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s &quot;hindsight&quot; and exploring the woods. In &quot;The Essential Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, Watterson presents a long poem explaining a night&#x27;s battle against a monster from Calvin&#x27;s perspective. &quot;The Authoritative Calvin and Hobbes&quot; includes a story based on Calvin&#x27;s use of the Transmogrifier to finish his reading homework.

A complete collection of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strips, in three hardcover volumes totaling 1440 pages, was released on October 4, 2005, by Andrews McMeel Publishing. It includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers, the treasuries&#x27; extra illustrated stories and poems and a new introduction by Bill Watterson in which he talks about his inspirations and his story leading up to the publication of the strip. The alternate 1985 strip is still omitted, and three other strips (January 7 and November 24, 1987, and November 25, 1988) have altered dialogue. A four-volume paperback version was released November 13, 2012.

To celebrate the release (which coincided with the strip&#x27;s 20th anniversary and the tenth anniversary of its absence from newspapers), Bill Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers.

Early books were printed in smaller format in black and white. These were later reproduced in twos in color in the &quot;Treasuries&quot; (&quot;Essential&quot;, &quot;Authoritative&quot; and &quot;Indispensable&quot;), except for the contents of &quot;Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons&quot;. Those Sunday strips were not reprinted in color until the &quot;Complete&quot; collection was finally published in 2005.

Watterson claims he named the books the &quot;&quot;Essential&quot;, &quot;Authoritative&quot; and &quot;Indispensable&quot;&quot; because, as he says in &quot;The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book&quot;, the books are &quot;obviously none of these things.&quot;

===&quot;Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes&quot;===
An officially licensed children&#x27;s textbook entitled &quot;Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was published in a single print run in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1993. The book is composed of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strips that form story arcs, including &quot;The Binoculars&quot; and &quot;The Bug Collection&quot;, followed by lessons based on the stories.

The book is rare and highly sought. It has been called the for &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; collectors.

==Reception==
Reviewing &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; in 1990, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Ken Tucker gave the strip an A+ rating, writing &quot;Watterson summons up the pain and confusion of childhood as much as he does its innocence and fun.&quot;

===Academic response===
In 1993, paleontologist and paleoartist Gregory S. Paul praised Bill Watterson for the scientific accuracy of the dinosaurs appearing in &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;.

In her 1994 book &quot;When Toys Come Alive&quot;, Lois Rostow Kuznets theorizes that Hobbes serves both as a figure of Calvin&#x27;s childish fantasy life and as an outlet for the expression of libidinous desires more associated with adults. Kuznets also analyzes Calvin&#x27;s other fantasies, suggesting that they are a second tier of fantasies utilized in places like school where transitional objects such as Hobbes would not be socially acceptable.

Political scientist James Q. Wilson, in a paean to &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; upon Watterson&#x27;s decision to end the strip in 1995, characterized it as &quot;our only popular explication of the moral philosophy of Aristotle.&quot;

Alisa White Coleman analyzed the strip&#x27;s underlying messages concerning ethics and values in &quot;&#x27;Calvin and Hobbes&#x27;: A Critique of Society&#x27;s Values,&quot; published in the &quot;Journal of Mass Media Ethics&quot; in 2000.

A collection of original Sunday strips was exhibited at Ohio State University&#x27;s Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum in 2001. Watterson himself selected the strips and provided his own commentary for the exhibition catalog, which was later published by Andrews McMeel as &quot;Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995&quot;.

Since the discontinuation of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, individual strips have been licensed for reprint in schoolbooks, including the Christian homeschooling book &quot;The Fallacy Detective&quot; in 2002, and the university-level philosophy reader &quot;Open Questions: Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing&quot; in 2005; in the latter, the ethical views of Watterson and his characters Calvin and Hobbes are discussed in relation to the views of professional philosophers. In a 2009 evaluation of the entire body of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strips using grounded theory methodology, Christijan D. Draper found that: &quot;Overall, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; suggests that meaningful time use is a key attribute of a life well lived,&quot; and that &quot;the strip suggests one way to assess the meaning associated with time use is through preemptive retrospection by which a person looks at current experiences through the lens of an anticipated future...&quot;

Jamey Heit&#x27;s &quot;Imagination and Meaning in Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, a critical and academic analysis of the strip, was published in 2012.

&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; strips were again exhibited at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at The Ohio State University in 2014, in an exhibition entitled &quot;Exploring Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. An exhibition catalog by the same title, which also contained an interview with Watterson conducted by Jenny Robb, the curator of the museum, was published by Andrews McMeel in 2015.

==Legacy==

Years after its original newspaper run, &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; has continued to exert influence in entertainment, art, and fandom.

In television, Calvin and Hobbes have been satirically depicted in stop motion animation in the 2006 and 2018 &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episodes &quot;Lust for Puppets&quot; and &quot;Jew No. 1 Opens a Treasure Chest&quot; respectively, and in traditional animation in the 2009 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven.&quot; In the 2013 &quot;Community&quot; episode &quot;Paranormal Parentage,&quot; the characters Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) and Troy Barnes (Donald Glover) dress as Calvin and Hobbes, respectively, for Halloween.

British artists, merchandisers, booksellers, and philosophers were interviewed for a 2009 BBC Radio 4 half-hour programme about the abiding popularity of the comic strip, narrated by Phill Jupitus.

The first book-length study of the strip, &quot;Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip&quot; by Nevin Martell, was first published in 2009; an expanded edition was published in 2010. The book chronicles Martell&#x27;s quest to tell the story of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and Watterson through research and interviews with people connected to the cartoonist and his work. The director of the later documentary &quot;Dear Mr. Watterson&quot; referenced &quot;Looking for Calvin and Hobbes&quot; in discussing the production of the movie, and Martell appears in the film.

The American documentary film &quot;Dear Mr. Watterson&quot;, released in 2013, explores the impact and legacy of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; through interviews with authors, curators, historians, and numerous professional cartoonists.

The enduring significance of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; to international cartooning was recognized by the jury of the Angoulême International Comics Festival in 2014 by the awarding of its Grand Prix to Watterson, only the fourth American to ever receive the honor (after Will Eisner, Robert Crumb, and Art Spiegelman).

From 2016 to 2021, author Berkeley Breathed included &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; in various &quot;Bloom County&quot; cartoons. He launched the first cartoon on April Fool&#x27;s Day 2016 and jokingly issued a statement suggesting that he had acquired &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; from Bill Watterson, who was &quot;out of the Arizona facility, continent and looking forward to some well-earned financial security.&quot; While bearing Watterson&#x27;s signature and drawing style as well as featuring characters from both &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and Breathed&#x27;s &quot;Bloom County&quot;, it is unclear whether Watterson had any input into these cartoons or not.

&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; remains the most viewed comic on GoComics, which cycles through old strips with an approximately 30-year delay.

===Grown-up Calvin===
Portraying Calvin as a teenager/adult has inspired writers.

In 2011, a comic strip appeared by cartoonists Dan and Tom Heyerman called &quot;Hobbes and Bacon&quot;. The strip depicts Calvin as an adult, married to Susie Derkins with a young daughter named after philosopher Francis Bacon, to whom Calvin gives Hobbes. Though consisting of only four strips originally, &quot;Hobbes and Bacon&quot; received considerable attention when it appeared and was continued by other cartoonists and artists.

A novel titled &quot;Calvin&quot; by CLA Young Adult Book Award–winning author Martine Leavitt was published in 2015. The story tells of seventeen-year-old Calvin—who was born on the day that &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; ended, and who has now been diagnosed with schizophrenia—and his hallucination of Hobbes, his childhood stuffed tiger. With his friend Susie, who might also be a hallucination, Calvin sets off to find Bill Watterson in the hope that the cartoonist can provide aid for Calvin&#x27;s condition.

The titular character of the comic strip &quot;Frazz&quot; has been noted for his similar appearance and personality to a grown-up Calvin. Creator Jef Mallett has stated that although Watterson is an inspiration to him, the similarities are unintentional.

<text>The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) is an independent voluntary consumer organisation headquartered in St Albans, which promotes real ale, cider and perry and traditional British pubs and clubs.

==History==
The organisation was founded on 16 March 1971 in Kruger&#x27;s Bar, Dunquin, County Kerry, Ireland, by Michael Hardman, Graham Lees, Jim Makin, and Bill Mellor, who were opposed to the growing mass production of beer and the homogenisation of the British brewing industry. The original name was the Campaign for the Revitalisation of Ale. Following the formation of the Campaign, the first annual general meeting took place in 1972, at the Rose Inn in Coton Road, Nuneaton. 

Early membership consisted of the four founders and their friends. Interest in CAMRA and its objectives spread rapidly, with 5,000 members signed up by 1973. Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of &quot;Death of the English Pub&quot;, who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of &quot;The Beer Drinker&#x27;s Companion&quot;, and later the many times &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot; editor, Roger Protz.

In 1991, CAMRA had 30,000 members across the UK and abroad and, a year later, helped to launch the European Beer Consumers Union.

==Activities==
CAMRA&#x27;s campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers. It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer, including stout, porter, and mild, as well as traditional cider and perry.

CAMRA&#x27;s states that real ale should be served without the use of additional carbonation. This means that &quot;any beer brand which is produced in both cask and keg versions&quot; is not admitted to CAMRA festivals if the brewery&#x27;s marketing is deemed to imply an equivalence of quality or character between the two versions.

==Organisation==

CAMRA is organised on a federal basis, over 200 local branches, each covering a particular geographical area of the UK, that contribute to the central body of the organisation based in St Albans. It is governed by a National Executive, made up of 12 voluntary unpaid directors elected by the membership. The local branches are grouped into 16 regions across the UK, such as the West Midlands or Wessex.

==Publications and websites==
CAMRA publishes the &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot;, an annually compiled directory of the best 4,500 real ale outlets and listing of real ale brewers.
CAMRA members received a monthly newspaper called &quot;What&#x27;s Brewing&quot; until its April 2021 issue and there is a quarterly colour magazine called &quot;Beer&quot;. It also maintains a National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain&#x27;s most historic pubs.

==Festivals==

CAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available. Members may get discounted entrance to CAMRA festivals.

The Campaign also organises the annual Great British Beer Festival in August. It is now held in the Great, National &amp; West Halls at the Olympia Exhibition Centre, in Kensington, London, having been held for a few years at Earl&#x27;s Court as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds. This is the UK&#x27;s largest beer festival, with over 900 beers, ciders and perries available over the week long event.

For many years, CAMRA also organised the National Winter Ales Festival. However, in 2017 this was re-branded as the Great British Beer Festival Winter where they award the Champion Winter Beer of Britain. Unlike the Great British Beer Festival, the Winter event does not have a permanent venue and is rotated throughout the country every three years. Recent hosts have been Derby and Norwich, with the event currently held each February in Birmingham. In 2020 CAMRA also launched the Great Welsh Beer Festival, to be held in Cardiff in April.

==Awards==
CAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the National Pub of the Year. The competition begins in the preceding year with branches choosing their local pub of the year through either a ballot or a panel of judges. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who agree the best using a scoring system that considers beer quality, aesthetic and welcome. The four finalists are announced each year before a ceremony to crown the winner in the spring. There are also the Pub Design Awards, which are held in association with English Heritage and the Victorian Society. These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished and converted pubs.

The best known CAMRA award is the Champion Beer of Britain, which is selected at the Great British Beer Festival. Other awards include the Champion Beer of Scotland and the Champion Beer of Wales.

==National Beer Scoring Scheme==
CAMRA developed the National Beer Scoring Scheme (NBSS) as an easy to use scheme for judging beer quality in pubs, to assist CAMRA branches in selecting pubs for the &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot;. CAMRA members input their beer scores online via WhatPub or through the Good Beer Guide app.

==Pub heritage==
The CAMRA Pub Heritage Group identifies, records and helps to protect pub interiors of historic and/or architectural importance, and seeks to get them listed.

The group maintains two inventories of Heritage pubs, the National Inventory (NI), which contains only those pubs that have been maintained in their original condition (or have been modified very little) for at least thirty years, but usually since at least World War II. The second, larger, inventory is the Regional Inventory (RI), which is broken down by county and contains both those pubs listed in the NI and other pubs that are not eligible for the NI, for reasons such as having been overly modified, but are still considered historically important, or have particular architectural value.

==LocAle==
The LocAle scheme was launched in 2007 to promote locally brewed beers. The scheme functions slightly differently in each area, and is managed by each branch, but each is similar: if the beer is to be promoted as a LocAle it must come from a brewery within a predetermined number of miles set by each CAMRA branch, generally around 20, although the North London branch has set it at 30 miles from brewery to pub, even if it comes from a distribution centre further away; in addition, each participating pub must keep at least one LocAle for sale at all times.

==Investment club==

CAMRA members may join the CAMRA Members&#x27; Investment Club which, since 1989, has invested in real ale breweries and pub chains. As of January 2021 the club had over 3,000 members and owned investments worth over £17 million. Although all investors must be CAMRA members, the CAMRA Members&#x27; Investment Club is not part of CAMRA Ltd.

<doc id="6061" wikidata="Q222971" url="?curid=6061" title="CNO cycle">
<text>In astrophysics, the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen (CNO) cycle, sometimes called Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle, after Hans Albrecht Bethe and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, is one of the two known sets of fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, the other being the proton–proton chain reaction (p–p cycle), which is more efficient at the Sun&#x27;s core temperature. The CNO cycle is hypothesized to be dominant in stars that are more than 1.3 times as massive as the Sun.

Unlike the proton-proton reaction, which consumes all its constituents, the CNO cycle is a catalytic cycle. In the CNO cycle, four protons fuse, using carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes as catalysts, each of which is consumed at one step of the CNO cycle, but re-generated in a later step. The end product is one alpha particle (a stable helium nucleus), two positrons, and two electron neutrinos.

There are various alternative paths and catalysts involved in the CNO cycles, but all these cycles have the same net result:
:4   +   2 
::   →     +     +   

The positrons will almost instantly annihilate with electrons, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. The neutrinos escape from the star carrying away some energy. One nucleus goes on to become carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes through a number of transformations in a repeating cycle.
The proton–proton chain is more prominent in stars the mass of the Sun or less. This difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two reactions; pp-chain reaction starts at temperatures around (4 megakelvin), making it the dominant energy source in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain starts at approximately , but its energy output rises much more rapidly with increasing temperatures so that it becomes the dominant source of energy at approximately .

The Sun has a core temperature of around , and only of nuclei produced in the Sun are
born in the CNO cycle.

The CNO-I process was independently proposed by Carl von Weizsäcker and Hans Bethe in the late 1930s.

The first reports of the experimental detection of the neutrinos produced by the CNO cycle in the Sun were published in 2020 by the BOREXINO collaboration. This was also the first experimental confirmation that the Sun had a CNO cycle, that the proposed magnitude of the cycle was accurate, and that von Weizsäcker and Bethe were correct.

== Cold CNO cycles ==
Under typical conditions found in stars, catalytic hydrogen burning by the CNO cycles is limited by proton captures. Specifically, the timescale for beta decay of the radioactive nuclei produced is faster than the timescale for fusion. Because of the long timescales involved, the cold CNO cycles convert hydrogen to helium slowly, allowing them to power stars in quiescent equilibrium for many years.

=== CNO-I ===
The first proposed catalytic cycle for the conversion of hydrogen into helium was initially called the carbon–nitrogen cycle (CN-cycle), also referred to as the Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle in honor of the independent work of Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker in 1937–38 and Hans Bethe. Bethe&#x27;s 1939 papers on the CN-cycle drew on three earlier papers written in collaboration with Robert Bacher and Milton Stanley Livingston and which came to be known informally as &quot;Bethe&#x27;s Bible&quot;. It was considered the standard work on nuclear physics for many years and was a significant factor in his being awarded the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics. Bethe&#x27;s original calculations suggested the CN-cycle was the Sun&#x27;s primary source of energy. This conclusion arose from a belief that is now known to be mistaken, that the abundance of nitrogen in the sun is approximately 10%; it is actually less than half a percent. The CN-cycle, named as it contains no stable isotope of oxygen, involves the following cycle of transformations:

This cycle is now understood as being the first part of a larger process, the CNO-cycle, and the main reactions in this part of the cycle (CNO-I) are: 
where the carbon-12 nucleus used in the first reaction is regenerated in the last reaction. After the two positrons emitted annihilate with two ambient electrons producing an additional , the total energy released in one cycle is 26.73 MeV; in some texts, authors are erroneously including the positron annihilation energy in with the beta-decay Q-value and then neglecting the equal amount of energy released by annihilation, leading to possible confusion. All values are calculated with reference to the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2003.

The limiting (slowest) reaction in the CNO-I cycle is the proton capture on . In 2006 it was experimentally measured down to stellar energies, revising the calculated age of globular clusters by around 1 billion years.

The neutrinos emitted in beta decay will have a spectrum of energy ranges, because although momentum is conserved, the momentum can be shared in any way between the positron and neutrino, with either emitted at rest and the other taking away the full energy, or anything in between, so long as all the energy from the Q-value is used. The total momentum received by the positron and the neutrino is not great enough to cause a significant recoil of the much heavier daughter nucleus and hence, its contribution to kinetic energy of the products, for the precision of values given here, can be neglected. Thus the neutrino emitted during the decay of nitrogen-13 can have an energy from zero up to , and the neutrino emitted during the decay of oxygen-15 can have an energy from zero up to . On average, about 1.7 MeV of the total energy output is taken away by neutrinos for each loop of the cycle, leaving about available for producing luminosity.

=== CNO-II ===
In a minor branch of the above reaction, occurring in the Sun&#x27;s core 0.04% of the time, the final reaction involving shown above does not produce carbon-12 and an alpha particle, but instead produces oxygen-16 and a photon and continues

In detail:

Like the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen involved in the main branch, the fluorine produced in the minor branch is merely an intermediate product; at steady state, it does not accumulate in the star.

=== CNO-III ===
This subdominant branch is significant only for massive stars. The reactions are started when one of the reactions in CNO-II results in fluorine-18 and a photon instead of nitrogen-14 and an alpha particle, and continues

In detail:

=== CNO-IV ===

Like the CNO-III, this branch is also only significant in massive stars. The reactions are started when one of the reactions in CNO-III results in fluorine-19 and a photon instead of nitrogen-15 and an alpha particle, and continues

In detail:


In some instances can combine with a helium nucleus to start a neon-sodium cycle, in which:

The sodium-23 can also turn into magesium-24 after proton bombardment, initiating the magnesium-aluminum cycle.

== Hot CNO cycles ==
Under conditions of higher temperature and pressure, such as those found in novae and X-ray bursts, the rate of proton captures exceeds the rate of beta-decay, pushing the burning to the proton drip line. The essential idea is that a radioactive species will capture a proton before it can beta decay, opening new nuclear burning pathways that are otherwise inaccessible. Because of the higher temperatures involved, these catalytic cycles are typically referred to as the hot CNO cycles; because the timescales are limited by beta decays instead of proton captures, they are also called the beta-limited CNO cycles.

=== HCNO-I ===
The difference between the CNO-I cycle and the HCNO-I cycle is that captures a proton instead of decaying, leading to the total sequence

=== HCNO-II ===
The notable difference between the CNO-II cycle and the HCNO-II cycle is that captures a proton instead of decaying, and neon is produced in a subsequent reaction on , leading to the total sequence

=== HCNO-III ===
An alternative to the HCNO-II cycle is that captures a proton moving towards higher mass and using the same helium production mechanism as the CNO-IV cycle as

While the total number of &quot;catalytic&quot; nuclei are conserved in the cycle, in stellar evolution the relative proportions of the nuclei are altered. When the cycle is run to equilibrium, the ratio of the carbon-12/carbon-13 nuclei is driven to 3.5, and nitrogen-14 becomes the most numerous nucleus, regardless of initial composition. During a star&#x27;s evolution, convective mixing episodes moves material, within which the CNO cycle has operated, from the star&#x27;s interior to the surface, altering the observed composition of the star. Red giant stars are observed to have lower carbon-12/carbon-13 and carbon-12/nitrogen-14 ratios than do main sequence stars, which is considered to be convincing evidence for the operation of the CNO cycle.

<text>Craps is a dice game in which players bet on the outcomes of the roll of a pair of dice. Players can wager money against each other (playing &quot;street craps&quot;) or against a bank (&quot;casino craps&quot;). Because it requires little equipment, &quot;street craps&quot; can be played in informal settings. While shooting craps, players may use slang terminology to place bets and actions.

==History==
Craps developed in the United States from a simplification of the western European game of Hazard, also spelled Hazzard or Hasard. The origins of Hazard are obscure and may date to the Crusades; a detailed description of Hazard was provided by Edmond Hoyle in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games, Improved&quot; (1790). At approximately the same time (1788), &quot;Krabs&quot; was documented as a French variation on Hazard.

In aristocratic London, crabs was the epithet for the sum combinations of two and three for two rolled dice, which in Hazard are instant-losing numbers for the first dice roll, regardless of the shooter&#x27;s selected main number. The name craps is derived from the corruption of this term crabs (or Krabs) to creps and then craps.

According to some accounts, Hazard was brought from London to New Orleans in approximately 1805 by the returning Bernard Xavier Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville, the young gambler and scion of a family of wealthy landowners in colonial Louisiana. Hazard allows the dice shooter to choose any number from five to nine as their &quot;main&quot; number; in a pamphlet published in 1933, Edward Tinker claimed that Marigny simplified the game by making the main always seven, which is the mathematically optimal choice, i.e., the choice with the lowest disadvantage for the shooter. However, more recent research indicates that Marigny played an unmodified version of Hazard, which had been played in America since at least the 1600s. Instead, John Scarne credits anonymous Black American inventors with simplifying and streamlining Hazard, increasing the pace of the game and adding a variety of wagers.

Regardless of who deserves credit for simplifying Hazard, the game initially was called Pass from the French word &quot;pas&quot; (meaning &quot;pace&quot; or &quot;step&quot;), and was popularized by the underclass starting in the early 19th century. Field hands taught their friends and deckhands, who carried the new game up the Mississippi River and its tributaries, although the game was never popular amongst the riverboat gamblers. Marigny gave the name Rue de Craps to a street in his new subdivision in New Orleans; in that city, craps experienced a resurgence of popularity in the late 1830s, but was not played in gaming houses until the 1890s. Budd Theobald credits the cultural exchange between attendants and railroad passengers on Pullman cars for popularizing the game, which eventually spread throughout America by the 1910s, when it was described as &quot;the gambling game of [the country]&quot; in &quot;Foster&#x27;s Complete Hoyle&quot; (1914).
The craps numbers of 2, 3, and 12 are similarly derived from Hazard. If the main is seven, then the two-dice sum of twelve is added to the crabs as a losing number on the first dice roll. This condition is retained in the simplified game called Pass. All three losing numbers (2, 3, and 12) on the first roll of Pass are jointly called the craps numbers. The central game Pass gradually has been supplemented over the decades by many companion games and wagers which can be played simultaneously with Pass; these are now collectively known as craps.

Early versions of bank craps played in casinos made money either by charging a commission to shooters or offering short odds on the various wagers, primarily on the &quot;Pass line&quot; bet for the shooter to win against the house. In approximately 1907, a dicemaker named John H. Winn in Philadelphia introduced a layout which featured a space to wager on &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; (i.e., for the shooter to lose) in addition to &quot;Pass&quot;. Virtually all modern casinos use his innovation, which incentivizes casinos to use fair dice. As introduced by Winn, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; bets were taken with a 5 percent commission to ensure the house retained an edge in running the game; this was replaced by the Bar-3 push for &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot;, and later by the Bar-12 (or Bar-2) push.
Craps exploded in popularity during World War II, which brought most young American men of every social class into the military. The street version of craps was popular among service members who often played it using a blanket as a shooting surface. Their military memories led to craps becoming the dominant casino game in postwar Las Vegas and the Caribbean.

After 1960, a few casinos in Europe, Australia, and Macau began offering craps, and, after 2004, online casinos extended the game&#x27;s spread globally.

==Bank craps==

Bank craps or casino craps is played by one or more players betting against the casino rather than each other. Both the players and the dealers stand around a large rectangular craps table. Sitting is discouraged by most casinos unless a player has medical reasons for requiring a seat.

The basic flow of a single game is:
===Craps table===

Players use casino chips rather than cash to bet on the Craps &quot;layout&quot;, a fabric surface which displays the various bets. The bets vary somewhat among casinos in availability, locations, and payouts. The tables roughly resemble bathtubs and come in various sizes. In some locations, chips may be called checks, tokens, or plaques.

Against one long side is the casino&#x27;s table bank: as many as two thousand casino chips in stacks of 20. The opposite long side is usually a long mirror. The U-shaped ends of the table have duplicate layouts and standing room for approximately eight players. In the center of the layout is an additional group of side bets which are used by players from both ends. The vertical walls at each end are usually covered with a rubberized target surface covered with small pyramid shapes to randomize the dice which strike them. The top edges of the table walls have one or two horizontal grooves in which players may store their reserve chips.
The table is run by up to four casino employees: a boxman seated (usually the only seated employee) behind the casino&#x27;s bank, who manages the chips, supervises the dealers, and handles &quot;coloring up&quot; players (exchanging small chip denominations for larger denominations in order to preserve the chips at a table); two base dealers who stand to either side of the boxman and collect and pay bets to players around their half of the table; and a stickman who stands directly across the table from the boxman, takes and pays (or directs the base dealers to do so) the bets in the center of the table, announces the results of each roll (usually with a distinctive patter), and moves the dice across the layout with an elongated wooden stick.

Each employee also watches for mistakes by the others because of the sometimes large number of bets and frantic pace of the game. In smaller casinos or at quiet times of day, one or more of these employees may be missing, and have their job covered by another, or cause player capacity to be reduced.

Some smaller casinos have introduced &quot;mini-craps&quot; tables which are operated with only two dealers; rather than being two essentially identical sides and the center area, a single set of major bets is presented, split by the center bets. Responsibility of the dealers is adjusted: while the stickman continues to handle the center bets, it is the base dealer who handles all other bets (as well as cash and chip exchanges).

By contrast, in &quot;street craps&quot;, there is no marked table and often the game is played with no back-stop against which the dice are to hit. Despite the name &quot;street craps&quot;, this game is often played in houses, usually on an un-carpeted garage or kitchen floor. The wagers are made in cash, never in chips, and are usually thrown down onto the ground or floor by the players. There are no attendants, and so the progress of the game, fairness of the throws, and the way that the payouts are made for winning bets are self-policed by the players.

===Dice===

The dice used at casinos for craps and many other games are sometimes called &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;gambling house dice&quot;. These are generally made from translucent extruded cellulose, with perfectly square edges each in length, with pips drilled deep and filled with opaque paint matching the density of cellulose, which ensures the dice remain balanced. The dice are buffed and polished to a high glossy finish after the pips are set, and the edges usually are left sharp, also called square or razor edge. To discourage cheating and dice substitution, each die carries a serial number and the casino&#x27;s logo or name. New Jersey specifies the maximum size of the die is on a side.

Under New Jersey regulations, the shooter selects two dice from a set of at least five.

===Rules of play===
Each casino may set which bets are offered and different payouts for them, though a core set of bets and payouts is typical. Players take turns rolling two dice and whoever is throwing the dice is called the &quot;shooter&quot;. Players can bet on the various options by placing chips directly on the appropriately-marked sections of the layout, or asking the base dealer or stickman to do so, depending on which bet is being made.

While acting as the shooter, a player must have a bet on either the &quot;Pass&quot; or the &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; line or both. &quot;Pass&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Win&quot; and &quot;Lose&quot;, &quot;Do&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, or &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;Wrong&quot;. The game is played in rounds and these &quot;Pass&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; bets are betting on the outcome of a single round. The shooter is presented with multiple dice (typically five) by the &quot;stickman&quot;, and must choose two for the round. The remaining dice are returned to the stickman&#x27;s bowl and are not used.
Each round has two phases: &quot;come-out&quot; and &quot;point&quot;. Dice are passed to the left.

====Phase 1 (Come-out)====
To start a round, the shooter makes one or more &quot;come-out&quot; rolls. While the come-out roll may specifically refer to the first roll of a new shooter, any roll where no point is established may be referred to as a come-out. By this definition the start of any new round regardless of whether it is the shooter&#x27;s first toss can be referred to as a come-out roll. The shooter must shoot toward the farther back wall and is generally required to hit the farther back wall with both dice. Casinos may allow a few warnings before enforcing the dice to hit the back wall and are generally lenient if at least one die hits the back wall. Both dice must be tossed in one throw. If only one die is thrown the shot is invalid.

A come-out roll of 2, 3, or 12 is called &quot;craps&quot; or &quot;crapping out&quot;, and anyone betting the Pass line loses. On the other hand, anyone betting the Don&#x27;t Pass line on come out wins with a roll of 2 or 3 and ties (pushes) if a 12 is rolled; in some rules, the 2 pushes instead of the 12, in which case the 3 and 12 win a Don&#x27;t Pass bet. Shooters may keep rolling after crapping out; the dice are only required to be passed if a shooter sevens out (rolls a seven after a point has been established). A come-out roll of 7 or 11 is a &quot;natural&quot;; the Pass line wins and Don&#x27;t Pass loses. The other possible numbers are the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls one of these numbers on the come-out roll, this establishes the &quot;point&quot; – to &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;win&quot;, the point number must be rolled again before a seven.

====Phase 2 (Point)====
The dealer flips a button to the &quot;On&quot; side and moves it to the point number signifying the second phase of the round. If the shooter &quot;hits&quot; the point value again (any value of the dice that sum to the point will do; the shooter does not have to exactly repeat the exact combination of the come-out roll) before rolling a seven, the Pass line wins and a new round starts. If the shooter rolls any seven before repeating the point number (a &quot;seven-out&quot;), the Pass line loses, the Don&#x27;t Pass line wins, and the dice pass clockwise to the next new shooter for the next round. Once a point has been established, any multi-roll bets (including line bets and odds for Pass, Don&#x27;t Pass, or both) are unaffected by the 2, 3, 11, or 12; the only numbers which affect the round are the established point, any specific bet on a number, or any 7. Any single roll bet is always affected (win or lose) by the outcome of any roll.

====Basic wagering rules====
Any player can make a bet on Pass or Don&#x27;t Pass as long as a point has not been established, or Come or Don&#x27;t Come as long as a point is established. All other bets, including an increase in odds behind the Pass and Don&#x27;t Pass lines, may be made at any time. All bets other than Pass line and Come may be removed or reduced any time before the bet loses. This is known as &quot;taking it down&quot; in craps.

The maximum bet for Place, Buy, Lay, Pass, and Come bets are generally equal to table maximum. Lay bet maximum are equal to the table maximum win, so players wishing to lay the 4 or 10 may bet twice at amount of the table maximum for the win to be table maximum. Odds behind Pass, Come, Don&#x27;t Pass, and Don&#x27;t Come may be however larger than the odds offered allows and can be greater than the table maximum in some casinos. Don&#x27;t odds are capped on the maximum allowed win some casino allow the odds bet itself to be larger than the maximum bet allowed as long as the win is capped at maximum odds. Single rolls bets can be lower than the table minimum, but the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The maximum allowed single roll bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll.

In all the above scenarios, whenever the Pass line wins, the Don&#x27;t Pass line loses, and vice versa, with one exception: on the come-out roll, a roll of 12 will cause Pass Line bets to lose, but Don&#x27;t Pass bets are pushed (or &quot;barred&quot;), neither winning nor losing; this is done to establish a house edge for Don&#x27;t Pass bets. (The same applies to &quot;Come&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come&quot; bets, discussed below.)

===Joining a game===
A player wishing to play craps without being the shooter should approach the craps table and first check to see if the dealer&#x27;s &quot;On&quot; button is on any of the point numbers.

* If the button has been turned to &quot;Off&quot;, then the table is in the come-out phase, and a point has not been established.
* If the dealer&#x27;s button is &quot;On&quot;, the table is in the point phase where casinos will allow odds behind an existing Pass line to be bet. Some casino do not allow new Pass line bets while a point has been established. Some casinos will place the bet straddling the outer border of the Pass line so as to indicate that it is to be paid the same odds as a place bet, instead of just even money. Other casinos will take the bet on the Pass line after a point has been established, known as put betting, which is a disadvantage to the player (since the seven is the most common roll and likely to happen before the &quot;point&quot;).

In either case, all single or multi-roll proposition bets may be placed in either of the two phases.

Between dice rolls there is a period for dealers to make payouts and collect losing bets, after which players can place new bets. The stickman monitors the action at a table and decides when to give the shooter the dice, after which no more betting is allowed.

When joining the game, one should place money on the table rather than passing it directly to a dealer. The dealer&#x27;s exaggerated movements during the process of &quot;making change&quot; or &quot;change only&quot; (converting currency to an equivalent in casino cheques) are required so that any disputes can be later reviewed against security camera footage.

===Rolling===
The dealers will insist that the shooter roll with one hand and that the dice bounce off the far wall surrounding the table. These requirements are meant to keep the game fair (preventing switching the dice or making a &quot;controlled shot&quot;). If a die leaves the table, the shooter will usually be asked to select another die from the remaining three but can request permission to use the same die if it passes the boxman&#x27;s inspection. This requirement exists to keep the game fair and reduce the chance of loaded dice.

===Names of rolls===

There are many local variants of the calls made by the stickman for rolls during a craps game. These frequently incorporate a reminder to the dealers as to which bets to pay or collect.

;Two — &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, &quot;Two Craps Two&quot;, &quot;Double Aces&quot;, &quot;Loose Deuce&quot;, &quot;Snickies&quot;: The two ones that compose it look like a pair of small, beady eyes. During actual play, more common terms are &quot;two craps two&quot; during the comeout roll because the Pass line bet is lost on a comeout crap roll and/or because a bet on any craps would win. &quot;Aces; double the field&quot; would be a more common call when not on the comeout roll to remind the dealers to pay double on the field bets and encourage the field bettor to place subsequent bets and/or when no crap bets have been placed. Another name for the two is &quot;loose deuce&quot; or &quot;Snickies&quot; due to it sounding like &quot;Snake eyes&quot; but spoken with an accent.
;Three — &quot;Three Craps Three&quot;, &quot;Ace Deuce&quot;, &quot;Tracy&quot;, &quot;Acey Deucy&quot;: Typically called as &quot;three craps three&quot; during the comeout roll, or &quot;three, ace deuce, come away single&quot; when not on the comeout to signify the come bet has been lost and to pay single to any field bettors. Three may also be referred to as &quot;ace caught a deuce&quot;, &quot;Tracy&quot;, or even less often &quot;acey deucey&quot;.
;Four (hard) — &quot;Little Joe&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Little Dick&quot;, &quot;Little Joe from Kokomo&quot;, &quot;Little Joe on the Front Row&quot;, &quot;Ballerina&quot;: usually hard, is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little Joe from Kokomo&quot; or &quot;Little Joe on the front row&quot; or just &quot;Little Joe&quot;. A hard four can be called a &quot;ballerina&quot; because it is two-two (&quot;tutu&quot;).
;Five — &quot;Phoebe&quot;, &quot;Fever in the South&quot;, &quot;West Kentucky&quot;, &quot;No Field Five&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;: is frequently called &quot;no field five&quot; in casinos in which five is not one of the field rolls and thus not paid in the field bets. Other names for a five are &quot;fever&quot; and &quot;little Phoebe&quot;.
;Six — &quot;Jimmie Hicks&quot;, &quot;Jimmie Hicks from the Sticks&quot;, &quot;666 Winner 6&quot;, &quot;Sixty Days&quot;, &quot;Sice&quot;: may be referred to as &quot;Jimmie Hicks&quot; or &quot;Jimmie Hicks from the sticks&quot;, examples of rhyming slang. On a win, the six is often called &quot;666 winner 6&quot; followed by &quot;came hard&quot; or &quot;came easy&quot;.
;Seven — &quot;Six Ace&quot;, &quot;Up Pops the Devil&quot;, &quot;Up Jumped the Devil&quot;, &quot;Big Red&quot;, &quot;Seven Out&quot;, &quot;Seven Out Seven&quot;: rolled as 6–1 is sometimes called &quot;six ace&quot; or &quot;up pops the Devil&quot;. Older dealers and players may use the term &quot;Big Red&quot; because craps tables once prominently featured a large red &quot;7&quot; in the center of the layout for the one-roll seven bet. During the comeout, the seven is called &quot;seven, front line winner&quot;, frequently followed by &quot;pay the line&quot; and/or &quot;take the don&#x27;ts&quot;. After the point is established, a seven is typically called by simply &quot;7 out&quot; or &quot;7 out 7&quot;..
;Eight (hard) — &quot;Eighter from Decatur&quot;, &quot;Ada from Decatur&quot;, &quot;Square Pair&quot;, &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot;: rolled the hard way, as opposed to an &quot;easy eight&quot;, is sometimes called an &quot;eighter from Decatur&quot;. It can also be known as a &quot;square pair&quot;, &quot;mom and dad&quot;, or &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.
;Nine — &quot;Centerfield Nine&quot;, &quot;Railroad Nine&quot;, &quot;Jesse James&quot;, &quot;Nina from Pasadena&quot;, &quot;Nina at the Marina&quot;, &quot;Niner from Carolina&quot;, Old Mike&quot;: is called a &quot;centerfield nine&quot; in casinos in which nine is one of the field rolls, because nine is the center number shown on the layout in such casinos (2–3–4–9–10–11–12). In Atlantic City, a 4–5 is called a &quot;railroad nine&quot;. The 4–5 nine is also known as &quot;Jesse James&quot; because the outlaw Jesse James was killed by a .45 caliber pistol. Other names for the nine include &quot;Nina from Pasadena&quot;, &quot;Nina at the Marina&quot;, and &quot;niner from Carolina&quot;. Nine can also be referred to as &quot;Old Mike&quot;, named after NBA Hall-of-Famer Michael Jordan, who wore No. 9 in his FIBA international career, when players could only wear numbers 4 to 15.
;Ten (hard) — &quot;Big Dick&quot;, &quot;Big Dick from Boston&quot;, &quot;Big Dick the Ladies&#x27; Friend&quot;, &quot;Dos Equis&quot;, &quot;Puppy Paws&quot;, &quot;Pair of Sunflowers&quot;, &quot;Big John&quot;: the hard way is &quot;a hard ten&quot;, &quot;dos equis&quot; (Spanish, meaning &quot;two X&#x27;s&quot;, because the pip arrangement on both dice on this roll resembles &quot;XX&quot;), or &quot;Hard ten – a woman&#x27;s best friend&quot;, an example of both rhyming slang and sexual double entendre. Ten as a pair of 5&#x27;s may also be known as &quot;puppy paws&quot; or &quot;a pair of sunflowers&quot; or &quot;Big Dick&quot; or &quot;Big John.&quot; Another slang for a hard ten is &quot;moose head&quot;, because it resembles a moose&#x27;s antlers. This phrase came from players in the Pittsburgh area.
;Eleven — &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;Yo-leven&quot;, &quot;Six Five No Jive&quot;: called out as &quot;yo&quot; or &quot;yo-leven&quot; to prevent being misheard as &quot;seven&quot;. An older term for eleven is &quot;six five, no jive&quot; because it is a winning roll. During the comeout, eleven is typically followed by &quot;front line winner&quot;. After the point is established, &quot;good field and come&quot; is often added.
;Twelve — &quot;Boxcars&quot;, &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Double-action Field Traction&quot;, &quot;12 Craps 12&quot;: known as &quot;boxcars&quot; because the spots on the two dice that show 6–6 look like schematic drawings of railroad boxcars; it is also called &quot;midnight&quot;, referring to twelve o&#x27;clock; and also as &quot;double-action field traction&quot;, because of the (standard) 2-to-1 pay on Field bets for this roll and the fact that the arrangement of the pips on the two dice, when laid end-to-end, resemble tire tracks. On tables that pay triple the field on a twelve roll, the stickman will often loudly exclaim &quot;triple&quot; either alone or in combination with &quot;12 craps 12&quot; or &quot;come away triple&quot;.

Rolls of 4, 6, 8, and 10 are called &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;gag&quot;, when rolled as a double, or &quot;easy&quot;, when rolled with two different numbers. For example, rolls will be called &quot;six the hard way&quot;, &quot;easy eight&quot;, &quot;hard ten&quot;, etc., because of their significance in center table bets known as the &quot;hard ways&quot;. Hard way rolls are so named because there is only one way to roll them (i.e., the value on each die is the same when the number is rolled). Consequently, it is more likely to roll the number in different-number combinations (easy) rather than as a double (hard).

== Bet odds and summary ==

:Note: Individual casinos may pay some of these bets at different payout ratios than those listed below. Some bets are listed more than once below – the most common payout in North American casinos is listed first, followed by other known variants.

:Note: &quot;True Odds&quot; do not vary.

The probability of dice combinations determine the odds of the payout. There are a total of 36 (6 × 6) possible combinations when rolling two dice. The following chart shows the dice combinations needed to roll each number. The two and twelve are the hardest to roll since only one combination of dice is possible. The game of craps is built around the dice roll of seven, since it is the most easily rolled dice combination.


Viewed another way:

The expected value of all bets is usually negative, such that the average player will always lose money. This is because the house always sets the paid odds to below the actual odds. The only exception is the &quot;odds&quot; bet that the player is allowed to make after a point is established on a pass/come Don&#x27;t Pass/Don&#x27;t Come bet (the odds portion of the bet has a long-term expected value of 0). However, this &quot;free odds&quot; bet cannot be made independently, so the expected value of the entire bet, including odds, is still negative. Since there is no correlation between die rolls, there is normally no possible long-term winning strategy in craps.

There are occasional promotional variants that provide either no house edge or even a player edge. One example is a field bet that pays 3:1 on 12 and 2:1 on either 3 or 11. Overall, given the 5:4 true odds of this bet, and the weighted average paid odds of approximately 7:5, the player has a 5% advantage on this bet. This is sometimes seen at casinos running limited-time incentives, in jurisdictions or gaming houses that require the game to be fair, or in layouts for use in informal settings using play money. No casino currently runs a craps table with a bet that yields a player edge full-time.

Maximizing the size of the odds bet in relation to the line bet will reduce, but never eliminate the house edge, and will increase variance. Most casinos have a limit on how large the odds bet can be in relation to the line bet, with single, double, and five times odds common. Some casinos offer 3–4–5 odds, referring to the maximum multiple of the line bet a player can place in odds for the points of 4 and 10, 5 and 9, and 6 and 8, respectively. During promotional periods, a casino may even offer 100× odds bets, which reduces the house edge to almost nothing, but dramatically increases variance, as the player will be betting in large betting units.

Since several of the multiple roll bets pay off in ratios of fractions on the dollar, it is important that the player bets in multiples that will allow a correct payoff in complete dollars. Normally, payoffs will be rounded down to the nearest dollar, resulting in a higher house advantage. These bets include all place bets, taking odds, and buying on numbers 6, 8, 5, and 9, as well as laying all numbers.

==Types of wagers==
===Line bets===

The shooter is required to make either a Pass line bet or a Don&#x27;t Pass bet if he wants to shoot. On the come out roll each player may only make one bet on the Pass or Don&#x27;t Pass, but may bet both if desired. The Pass Line and Don&#x27;t Pass bet is optional for any player not shooting. In rare cases, some casinos require all players to make a minimum Pass Line or Don&#x27;t Pass bet (if they want to make any other bet), whether they are currently shooting or not.
====Pass line====
The basic bet in craps is the Pass line bet, which is a bet for the shooter to win. This bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum.
* If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet wins.
* If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses (known as &quot;crapping out&quot;).
* If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.
** If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet wins.
** If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again (&quot;seven out&quot;), the bet loses.
The Pass line bet pays even money.

The Pass line bet is a contract bet. Once a Pass line bet is made, it is always working and cannot be turned &quot;Off&quot;, taken down, or reduced until a decision is reached – the point is made, or the shooter sevens out. A player may increase any corresponding odds (up to the table limit) behind the Pass line at any time after a point is established. Players may only bet the Pass line on the come out roll when no point has been established, unless the casino allows put betting where the player can bet Pass line or increase an existing Pass line bet whenever desired and may take odds immediately if the point is already on.

====Don&#x27;t Pass====
A Don&#x27;t Pass bet is a bet for the shooter to lose (&quot;seven out, line away&quot;) and is almost the opposite of the Pass line bet. Like the Pass bet, this bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum.
* If the come-out roll is 3, the bet wins.
* If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet loses.
* If the game is being played under &quot;Bar-12&quot; or &quot;Bar Sixes&quot;:
** If the come-out roll is 2, the bet wins.
** If the come-out roll is 12, the bet is a push (neither won nor lost).
* Alternatively, if the game instead is played under &quot;Bar-2&quot; or &quot;Bar Aces&quot;:
** If the come-out roll is 2, the bet is a push.
** If the come-out roll is 12, the bet wins.
* If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point.
** If, with a point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again (&quot;seven out&quot;), the bet wins.
** If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet loses.
The Don&#x27;t Pass bet pays even money.

The Don&#x27;t Pass bet is a no-contract bet. After a point is established, a player may take down or reduce a Don&#x27;t Pass bet and any corresponding odds at any time because odds of rolling a 7 before the point is in the player&#x27;s favor. Once taken down or reduced, however, the Don&#x27;t Pass bet may not be restored or increased. Because the shooter must have a line bet the shooter generally may not reduce a Don&#x27;t Pass bet below the table minimum. In Las Vegas, a majority of casinos will allow the shooter to move the bet to the Pass line in lieu of taking it down; however, in other areas such as Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, this is not allowed. Even though players are allowed to remove the Don&#x27;t Pass line bet after a point has been established, the bet cannot be turned &quot;Off&quot; without being removed. If a player chooses to remove the Don&#x27;t Pass line bet, he or she can no longer lay odds behind the Don&#x27;t Pass line. The player can, however, still make standard lay bets on any of the point numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).

The casino chooses either Bar-2 or Bar-12, but not both. The push on 12 or 2 is mathematically necessary to maintain the house edge over the player. Other casinos allow the player to choose to either push on 2 (&quot;Bar Aces&quot;) or push on 12 (&quot;Bar Sixes&quot;) depending on where it is placed on the layout. Some older bank crap games used Bar-3 (&quot;Bar Ace-Deuce&quot;), which increases the house edge.

There are two different ways to calculate the odds and house edge of this bet. The summary table gives the numbers considering that the game ends in a push when a 12 is rolled, rather than being undetermined. Betting on Don&#x27;t Pass is often called &quot;playing the dark side&quot;, and it is considered by some players to be in poor taste, or even taboo, because it goes directly against conventional play, winning when most of the players lose.

====Pass odds====
If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll (i.e., when a point is established), most casinos allow Pass line players to take odds by placing up to some predetermined multiple of the Pass line bet, behind the Pass line. This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds:
* 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point,
* 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, or
* 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point.

Unlike the Pass line bet itself, the Pass line odds bet can be turned &quot;Off&quot; (not working), removed or reduced anytime before it loses. In Las Vegas, generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and Pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10, players can bet as little as $1 on odds if the table minimum is low such as is $5, $10 or $15. If the player requests the Pass odds be not working (&quot;Off&quot;) and the shooter sevens-out or hits the point, the Pass line bet will be lost or doubled and the Pass odds returned.

Individual casinos (and sometimes tables within a casino) vary greatly in the maximum odds they offer, from single or double odds (one or two times the Pass line bet) up to 100× or even unlimited odds. A variation often seen is &quot;3-4-5× Odds&quot;, where the maximum allowed odds bet depends on the point: three times if the point is 4 or 10; four times on points of 5 or 9; or five times on points of 6 or 8. This rule simplifies the calculation of winnings: a maximum Pass odds bet on a 3–4–5× table will always be paid at six times the Pass line bet regardless of the point.

As odds bets are paid at true odds, in contrast with the Pass line which is always even money, taking odds on a minimum Pass line bet lessens the house advantage compared with betting the same total amount on the Pass line only. A maximum odds bet on a minimum Pass line bet often gives the lowest house edge available in any game in the casino. However, the odds bet cannot be made independently, so the house retains an edge on the Pass line bet itself.

====Don&#x27;t Pass odds====
If a player is playing Don&#x27;t Pass instead of pass, they also may lay odds by placing chips behind the Don&#x27;t Pass line. If a 7 comes before the point is rolled, the Don&#x27;t Pass odds pay at true odds:
* 1-to-2 if 4 or 10 is the point,
* 2-to-3 if 5 or 9 is the point, or
* 5-to-6 if 6 or 8 is the point.

Typically the maximum lay bet will be expressed such that a player may win up to an amount equal to the maximum odds multiple at the table. If a player lays maximum odds with a point of 4 or 10 on a table offering five-times odds, he would be able to lay a maximum of ten times the amount of his Don&#x27;t Pass bet. At 5× odds table, the maximum amount the combined bet can win will always be 6× the amount of the Don&#x27;t Pass bet. Players can bet table minimum odds if desired and win less than table minimum.

Like the Don&#x27;t Pass bet the odds can be removed or reduced. Unlike the Don&#x27;t Pass bet itself, the Don&#x27;t Pass odds can be turned &quot;Off&quot; (not working). In Las Vegas generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine lay odds and Don&#x27;t Pass bet must be table minimum so players may bet as little as the minimum two units on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $2 if the table minimum is low such as $5, $10 or $15 tables. If the player requests the Don&#x27;t Pass odds to be not working (&quot;Off&quot;) and the shooter hits the point or sevens-out, the Don&#x27;t Pass bet will be lost or doubled and the Don&#x27;t Pass odds returned. Unlike a standard lay bet on a point, lay odds behind the Don&#x27;t Pass line does not charge commission (vig).

====Come bet====
A player making a Come bet is wagering on the first number that &quot;comes&quot; from the shooter&#x27;s next roll, regardless of the table&#x27;s phase. In other words, a Come bet can be considered as starting an entirely new Pass line bet, unique to that player. 
* If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the shooter&#x27;s next roll, the Come bet wins.
* If a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled on the shooter&#x27;s next roll, the Come bet loses.
* If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is rolled on the shooter&#x27;s next roll, the number becomes the &quot;come-bet point&quot;.
** The Come bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the same &quot;come-bet point&quot; number the shooter threw.
** If, with the Come-bet point established, that number is rolled during this second phase, the Come bet wins.
** If, with the Come-bet point established, a 7 is rolled during this second phase, the Come bet loses.
** The player is allowed to take odds on the Come-bet point, just like a Pass line bet.

The Come bet pays off at even money, like the Pass line bet.

Come bets can only be made after a point has been established since, on the come-out roll, a Come bet would be the same as a Pass line bet. Like the Pass line bet, each player may only make one Come bet per roll; this does not exclude a player from betting odds on an already established come-bet point. The Come bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum. Players may bet both the Come and Don&#x27;t Come on the same roll if desired.

Also like a Pass line bet, the come bet is a contract bet and is always working, and cannot be turned &quot;Off&quot;, removed or reduced until it wins or loses. However, the odds taken behind a Come bet can be turned &quot;Off&quot; (not working), removed or reduced anytime before the bet loses. In Las Vegas generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and Pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10, players can bet as little as $1 if the table minimum is low such as $5, $10, or $15 minimums. If the player requests the Come odds to be not working (&quot;Off&quot;) and the shooter sevens-out or hits the Come bet point, the Come bet will be lost or doubled and the Come odds returned. If the casino allows put betting a player may increase a Come bet after a point has been established and bet larger odds behind if desired. Put betting also allows a player to bet on a Come and take odds immediately on a point number without a Come bet point being established.

The dealer will place the odds on top of the come bet, but slightly off center in order to differentiate between the original bet and the odds. The second round wins if the shooter rolls the come bet point again before a seven. Winning come bets are paid the same as winning Pass line bets: even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds bet. If, instead, the seven is rolled before the come-bet point, the come bet (and any odds bet) loses.

Because of the come bet, if the shooter makes their point, a player can find themselves in the situation where they still have a come bet (possibly with odds on it) and the next roll is a come-out roll. In this situation, odds bets on the come wagers are usually presumed to be not working for the come-out roll. That means that if the shooter rolls a 7 on the come-out roll, any players with active come bets waiting for a come-bet point lose their initial wager but will have their odds bets returned to them.

If the come-bet point is rolled on the come-out roll, the odds do not win but the come bet does and the odds bet is returned (along with the come bet and its payoff). The player can tell the dealer that they want their odds working, such that if the shooter rolls a number that matches the come point, the odds bet will win along with the come bet, and if a seven is rolled, both lose.

Many players will use a come bet as &quot;insurance&quot; against sevening out: if the shooter rolls a seven, the come bet pays 1:1, offsetting the loss of the Pass line bet. The risk in this strategy is the situation where the shooter does not hit a seven for several rolls, leading to multiple come bets that will be lost if the shooter eventually sevens out.

====Don&#x27;t Come bet====
In the same way that a Come bet is similar to a Pass line bet, a Don&#x27;t Come bet is similar to a Don&#x27;t Pass bet. Like the Come, the Don&#x27;t Come can only be bet after a point has already been established as it is the same as a Don&#x27;t Pass line bet when no point is established. This bet must be at least the table minimum and at most the table maximum. A Don&#x27;t Come bet is played in two phases, just like the Don&#x27;t Pass line bet.
* If a 2 or 3 is rolled in the first phase, it wins.
* If a 7 or 11 is rolled, it loses.
* If a 12 is rolled, it is a push, assuming that Bar-12 is being followed; if Bar-2 is being followed, 2 instead is a push and 12 wins, in the same way as described above for the variants of the Don&#x27;t Pass bet.
* If, instead, the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, this sets the Don&#x27;t Come point.
** The base dealer will move the Don&#x27;t Come bet onto a box representing the Don&#x27;t Come point, i.e., the number the shooter threw.
** The second phase wins if the shooter rolls a seven before the Don&#x27;t Come point.

Like the Don&#x27;t Pass each player may only make one Don&#x27;t Come bet per roll, this does not exclude a player from laying odds on an already established Don&#x27;t Come points. Players may bet both the Don&#x27;t Come and Come on the same roll if desired.

The player may lay odds on a Don&#x27;t Come bet, just like a Don&#x27;t Pass bet; in this case, the dealer (not the player) places the odds bet on top of the bet in the box, because of limited space, slightly offset to signify that it is an odds bet and not part of the original Don&#x27;t Come bet. Lay odds behind a Don&#x27;t Come are subject to the same rules as Don&#x27;t Pass lay odds. Unlike a standard lay bet on a point, lay odds behind a Don&#x27;t Come point does not charge commission (vig) and gives the player true odds. Like the Don&#x27;t Pass line bet, Don&#x27;t Come bets are no-contract, and can be removed or reduced after a Don&#x27;t Come point has been established, but cannot be turned off (&quot;not working&quot;) without being removed. A player may also call, &quot;No Action&quot; when a point is established, and the bet will not be moved to its point. This play is not to the player&#x27;s advantage. If the bet is removed, the player can no longer lay odds behind the Don&#x27;t Come point and cannot restore or increase the same Don&#x27;t Come bet. Players must wait until next roll as long as a Pass line point has been established (players cannot bet Don&#x27;t Come on come out rolls) before they can make a new Don&#x27;t Come bet. Las Vegas casinos which allow put betting allows players to move the Don&#x27;t Come directly to any Come point as a put; however, this is not allowed in Atlantic City or Pennsylvania. Unlike the Don&#x27;t Come bet itself, the Don&#x27;t Come odds can be turned &quot;Off&quot; (not working), removed, or reduced if desired. In Las Vegas, players generally must lay at least table minimum on odds if desired and win less than table minimum; in Atlantic City and Pennsylvania a player&#x27;s combined bet must be at least table minimum, so depending on the point number players may lay as little as 2 minimum units (e.g. if the point is 4 or 10). If the player requests the Don&#x27;t Come odds be not working (&quot;Off&quot;) and the shooter hits the Don&#x27;t Come point or sevens-out, the Don&#x27;t Come bet will be lost or doubled and the Don&#x27;t Come odds returned.

Winning Don&#x27;t Come bets are paid the same as winning Don&#x27;t Pass bets: even money for the original bet and true odds for the odds lay. Unlike come bets, the odds laid behind points established by Don&#x27;t Come bets are always working including come out rolls unless the player specifies otherwise.

===Multi-roll bets===

These are bets that may not be settled on the first roll and may need one or more subsequent rolls before an outcome is determined.

Most multi-roll bets may fall into the situation where a point is made by the shooter before the outcome of the multi-roll bet is decided. These bets are often considered &quot;not working&quot; on the new come-out roll until the next point is established, unless the player calls the bet as &quot;working.&quot;

Casino rules vary on this; some of these bets may not be callable, while others may be considered &quot;working&quot; during the come-out. Dealers will usually announce if bets are working unless otherwise called off. If a non-working point number placed, bought or laid becomes the new point as the result of a come-out, the bet is usually refunded, or can be moved to another number for free.

====Place====
Players can bet any point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) by placing their wager in the come area and telling the dealer how much and on what number(s), &quot;30 on the 6&quot;, &quot;5 on the 5&quot;, or &quot;25 on the 10&quot;. These are typically &quot;Place Bets to Win&quot;. These are bets that the number bet on will be rolled before a 7 is rolled, similar to the Pass odds bets. These bets are considered working bets, and will continue to be paid out each time a shooter rolls the number bet. On a come-out roll, a place bet is considered to be not in effect unless the player who made it specifies otherwise. This bet may be removed or reduced at any time until it loses; in the latter case, the player must abide by any table minimums.

Place bets to win pay out at slightly worse than the true odds: 9-to-5 on points 4 or 10, 7-to-5 on points 5 or 9, and 7-to-6 on points 6 or 8. The place bets on the outside numbers (4,5,9,10) should be made in units of $5, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $5 paying $7 or $5 paying $9. The place bets on the 6 &amp; 8 should be made in units of $6, (on a $5 minimum table), in order to receive the correct exact payout of $6 paying $7. For the 4 and 10, it is to the player&#x27;s advantage to &#x27;buy&#x27; the bet (see below).

An alternative form, rarely offered by casinos, is the &quot;place bet to lose.&quot; This bet is the opposite of the place bet to win and pays off if a 7 is rolled before the specific point number. The place bet to lose typically carries a lower house edge than a place bet to win. Payouts are 4-to-5 on points 6 or 8, 5-to-8 on 5 or 9, and 5-to-11 on 4 or 10.

====Buy====
Players can also buy a bet which are paid at true odds, but a 5% commission is charged on the amount of the bet. Buy bets are placed with the shooter betting at a specific number will come out before a player sevens out. The buy bet must be at least table minimum excluding commission; however, some casinos require the minimum buy bet amount to be at least $20 to match the $1 charged on the 5% commission. Traditionally, the buy bet commission is paid no matter what, but in recent years a number of casinos have changed their policy to charge the commission only when the buy bet wins. Some casinos charge the commission as a one-time fee to buy the number; payouts are then always at true odds. Most casinos usually charge only $1 for a $25 green-chip bet (4% commission), or $2 for $50 (two green chips), reducing the house advantage a bit more. Players may remove or reduce this bet (bet must be at least table minimum excluding vig) anytime before it loses. Buy bets like place bets are not working when no point has been established unless the player specifies otherwise.

Where commission is charged only on wins, the commission is often deducted from the winning payoff—a winning $25 buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance. The house edges stated in the table assume the commission is charged on all bets. They are reduced by at least a factor of two if commission is charged on winning bets only.

====Lay====
A lay bet is the opposite of a buy bet, where a player bets on a 7 to roll before the number that is laid. Players may only lay the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 and may lay multiple numbers if desired. Just like the buy bet lay bets pay true odds, but because the lay bet is the opposite of the buy bet, the payout is reversed. Therefore, players get 1 to 2 for the numbers 4 and 10, 2 to 3 for the numbers 5 and 9, and 5 to 6 for the numbers 6 and 8. A 5% commission (vigorish, vig, juice) is charged up front on the possible winning amount. For example: A $40 Lay Bet on the 4 would pay $20 on a win. The 5% vig would be $1 based on the $20 win. (not $2 based on the $40 bet as the way buy bet commissions are figured.) Like the buy bet the commission is adjusted to suit the betting unit such that fraction of a dollar payouts are not needed. Casinos may charge the vig up front thereby requiring the player to pay a vig win or lose, other casinos may only take the vig if the bet wins. Taking vig only on wins lowers house edge. Players may removed or reduce this bet (bet must be at least table minimum) anytime before it loses. Some casinos in Las Vegas allow players to lay table minimum plus vig if desired and win less than table minimum. Lay bet maximums are equal to the table maximum win, so if a player wishes to lay the 4 or 10, he or she may bet twice at amount of the table maximum for the win to be table maximum. Other casinos require the minimum bet to win at $20 even at the lowest minimum tables in order to match the $1 vig, this requires a $40 bet. Similar to buy betting, some casinos only take commission on win reducing house edge. Unlike place and buy bets, lay bets are always working even when no point has been established. The player must specify otherwise if he or she wishes to have the bet not working.

If a player is unsure of whether a bet is a single or multi-roll bet, it can be noted that all single-roll bets will be displayed on the playing surface in one color (usually red), while all multi-roll bets will be displayed in a different color (usually yellow).

====Put====
A put bet is a bet which allows players to increase or make a Pass line bet after a point has been established (after come-out roll). Players may make a put bet on the Pass line and take odds immediately or increase odds behind if a player decides to add money to an already existing Pass line bet. Put betting also allows players to increase an existing come bet for additional odds after a come point has been established or make a new come bet and take odds immediately behind if desired without a come bet point being established. If increased or added put bets on the Pass line and Come cannot be turned &quot;Off&quot;, removed or reduced, but odds bet behind can be turned &quot;Off&quot;, removed or reduced. The odds bet is generally required to be the table minimum. Player cannot put bet the Don&#x27;t Pass or Don&#x27;t Come. Put betting may give a larger house edge over place betting unless the casino offers high odds.

Put bets are generally allowed in Las Vegas, but not allowed in Atlantic City and Pennsylvania.

Put bets are better than place bets (to win) when betting more than 5-times odds over the flat bet portion of the put bet. For example, a player wants a $30 bet on the six. Looking at two possible bets: 1) Place the six, or 2) Put the six with odds. A $30 place bet on the six pays $35 if it wins. A $30 put bet would be a $5 flat line bet plus $25 (5-times) in odds, and also would pay $35 if it wins. Now, with a $60 bet on the six, the place bet wins $70, where the put bet ($5 + $55 in odds) would pay $71. The player needs to be at a table which not only allows put bets, but also high-times odds, to take this advantage.

====Hard way====

This bet can only be placed on the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 10. In order for this bet to win, the chosen number must be rolled the &quot;hard way&quot; (as doubles) before a 7 or any other non-double combination (&quot;easy way&quot;) totaling that number is rolled. For example, a player who bets a hard 6 can only win by seeing a 3–3 roll come up before any 7 or any easy roll totaling 6 (4–2 or 5–1); otherwise, the player loses.

In Las Vegas casinos, this bet is generally working, including when no point has been established, unless the player specifies otherwise. In other casinos such as those in Atlantic City, hard ways are not working when the point is off unless the player requests to have it working on the come out roll.

Like single-roll bets, hard way bets can be lower than the table minimum; however, the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The minimum hard way bet can be a minimum one unit. For example, lower stake table minimums of $5 or $10, generally allow minimum hard ways bets of $1. The maximum bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll.

Easy way is not a specific bet offered in standard casinos, but a term used to define any number combination which has two ways to roll. For example, (6–4, 4–6) would be a &quot;10 easy&quot;. The 4, 6, 8 or 10 can be made both hard and easy ways. Betting point numbers (which pays off on easy or hard rolls of that number) or single-roll (&quot;hop&quot;) bets (e.g., &quot;hop the 2–4&quot; is a bet for the next roll to be an easy six rolled as a two and four) are methods of betting easy ways.

====Big 6 and Big 8====
A player can wager on either the 6 or 8 being rolled before the shooter throws a seven. These wagers are usually avoided by experienced craps players since they create a large house edge by paying even money (1:1) while the true odds are 6:5; experienced players realize the house edge would be reduced by instead making place bets on the 6 or the 8, since those pay more (7:6) and are closer to the true odds. Some casinos (especially all those in Atlantic City) do not even offer the Big 6 &amp; 8. The bets are located in the corners behind the Pass line, and bets may be placed directly by players.

The only real advantage offered by the Big 6 &amp; 8 is that they can be bet for the table minimum, whereas a place bet minimum may sometimes be greater than the table minimum (e.g. $6 place bet on a $3 minimum game.) In addition place bets are usually not working, except by agreement, when the shooter is &quot;coming out&quot; i.e. shooting for a point, and Big 6 and 8 bets always work. Some modern layouts no longer show the Big 6/Big 8 bet.

===Single-roll bets===

Single-roll (proposition) bets are resolved in one dice roll by the shooter. Most of these are called &quot;service bets&quot;, and they are located at the center of most craps tables. Only the stickman or a dealer can place a service bet. Single-roll bets can be lower than the table minimum, but the maximum bet allowed is also lower than the table maximum. The maximum bet is based on the maximum allowed win from a single roll. The lowest single-roll bet can be a minimum one unit bet. For example, tables with minimums of $5 or $10 generally allow minimum single-roll bets of $1. Single bets are always working by default unless the player specifies otherwise. The bets include:

;2 (snake eyes, or Aces): Wins if shooter rolls a 2.
;3 (ace-deuce): Wins if the shooter rolls a 3.
;Yo: Wins if the shooter rolls 11.
;12 (boxcars, midnight, or cornrows): Wins if shooter rolls a 12.
;2 or 12 (hi-lo): Wins if shooter rolls a 2 or 12. The stickman places this bet on the line dividing the 2 and 12 bets.
;Any Craps (Three-Way): Wins if the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12.
;C &amp; E: A combined bet, a player is betting half their bet on craps (2,3,12) and the other half on 11 (yo). The combine payout is 3:1 on craps and 7:1 on 11 (yo). Another method of calculating the payout is to divide the total bet in half. The player would receive 7:1 minus half the total bet payout on half the total bet for craps and 15:1 minus half the total bet payout on half the total bet for 11 (yo). For example, using this method if a player were to bet $2 on C &amp; E, $1 would receive 7:1 payout on craps minus $1 for the bet on 11 so the total profit would be $6. If an 11 was rolled the player would receive 15:1 minus $1 for the bet on craps so the player&#x27;s total profit is $14. Both methods of calculation yield the same result so either method can be used. If a player wishes to take the bet down after a win the player would receive the whole bet not half even though only one of the two bets can win per roll. The minimum bet on C &amp; E is double the lowest unit bet allowed at the table. So if the minimum single roll bet is $1 the lowest C &amp; E bet allowed would be $2. Players are, however, able to make odd number bets larger than $2 if desired. One of the two bets will always lose, the other may win.
;Any seven: A single roll bet which wins if the shooter rolls a 7 with 4:1 payout. This bet is also nicknamed Big Red, since the 7 on its betting space on the layout is usually large and red, and it is considered bad luck and a breach of etiquette among gamblers to speak the word &quot;seven&quot; at the table.
;Horn: This is a bet that involves betting on 1 unit each for 2, 3, 11, and 12 at the same time for the next roll. The bet is actually four separate bets, and pays off depending on which number is actually rolled. The combined payout is 27:4 for 2, 12 and 3:1 for 3, 11. Each individual bet has the same payout as a single bet on the specific numbers, 30:1 for 2 and 12 minus the other three bets, 15:1 for 3 and 11 minus the other three bets. If a player wins the bet he can take down all four bets instead of a single bet even though only one bet can win per roll. Many players, in order to eliminate the confusion of tossing four chips to the center of the table or having change made while bets are being placed, will make a five-unit Horn High bet, which is a four-way bet with the extra unit going to one specific number. For example, if one tosses a $5 chip into the center and says &quot;horn high yo&quot;, they are placing four $1 bets on each of the horn numbers and the extra dollar will go on the yo (11). Horn bets are generally required to be in multiples of 4 or 5 with the minimum bet being 4 times the minimum unit allowed. For example, if the single roll minimum at the table is $1 the Horn bet must be $4 or more.
;Whirl or World: A five-unit bet that is a combination of a horn and any-seven bet, with the idea that if a seven is rolled the bet is a push, because the money won on the seven is lost on the horn portions of the bet. The combine odds are 26:5 on the 2, 12, 11:5 on the 3, 11, and a push on the 7. Like the C &amp; E and Horn bet, if a player wishes to take down the bet after a win he or she would receive all five units back. The minimum bet is five of the minimum units. For example, if the minimum single roll bet is $1, the minimum World/Whirl bet is $5.
;On the Hop: (also Hop, or Hopping) A single roll bet on any particular combination of the two dice on the next roll including combinations whose sum is 7 (e.g. 4 and 3). For example, if someone bets on &quot;5 and 1&quot; on the hop, they are betting that the next roll will have a 5 on one die and a 1 on the other die. The bet pays 15:1 on easy ways (same as a bet on 3 or 11). Hard ways hop pays 30:1 (e.g., 3 and 3 on the hop, same as a bet on 2 or 12). The true odds are 17:1 and 35:1, resulting in a house edge of 11.11% and 13.89% respectively. When presented, hop bets are located at the center of the craps layout with the other proposition bets. If hop bets are not on the craps layout, they still may be bet on by players but they become the responsibility of the boxman to book the bet. Sometimes players may request to hop a whole number. In this case the money on the bet different combinations. For example, if a player says &quot;hop the tens&quot; (6–4, 5–5, 4–6) the player must give the dealer an even number bet so it can be divided among the hard and easy ways. If the player gives $10, $5 would be placed on the easy ways 10 with 15:1 odds and $5 would be placed on the hard way with 30:1 odds. If a player wishes to &quot;hop the sevens&quot; there would be three different combinations and six possible ways to roll a 7 (6–1, 5–2, 4–3, 3–4, 2–5, 1–6) therefore the player should bet in multiples of 3 so the bet can be divided among each combination with a 15:1 payout minus the other two bets, otherwise if players does not bet in multiples of 3, they would specific which combination has additional units.
;Field: This bet is a wager that one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12 will appear on the next roll of the dice. This bet typically pays more (2:1 or 3:1) if 2 or 12 is rolled, and 1:1 if 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11 is rolled. The Field bet is a &quot;Self-Service&quot; Bet. Unlike the other proposition bets which are handled by the dealers or stickman, the field bet is placed directly by the player. Players identify their Field bets by placing them in the Field area directly in front of them or as close to their position as possible. The initial bet and/or any payouts can &quot;ride&quot; through several rolls until they lose, and are assumed to be &quot;riding&quot; by dealers. It is thus the player&#x27;s responsibility to collect their bet and/or winnings immediately upon payout, before the next dice roll, if they do not wish to let it ride.

===Player bets===

Fire Bet: Before the shooter begins, some casinos will allow a bet known as a fire bet to be placed. A fire bet is a bet of as little as $1 and generally up to a maximum of $5 to $10 sometimes higher, depending on casino, made in the hope that the next shooter will have a hot streak of setting and getting many points of different values. As different individual points are made by the shooter, they will be marked on the craps layout with a fire symbol.

The first three points will not pay out on the fire bet, but the fourth, fifth, and sixth will pay out at increasing odds. The fourth point pays at 24-to-1, the fifth point pays at 249-to-1, and the 6th point pays at 999-to-1. (The points must all be different numbers for them to count toward the fire bet.) For example, a shooter who successfully hits a point of 10 twice will only garner credit for the first one on the fire bet. Players must hit the established point in order for it to count toward the fire bet. The payout is determine by the number of points which have been established and hit after the shooter sevens out.

Bonus Craps: Prior to the initial &quot;come out roll&quot;, players may place an optional wager (usually a $1 minimum to a maximum $25) on one or more of the three Bonus Craps wagers, &quot;All Small&quot;, &quot;All Tall&quot;, or &quot;All or Nothing at All.&quot; For players to win the &quot;All Small&quot; wager, the shooter must hit all five small numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) before a seven is rolled; similarly, &quot;All Tall&quot; wins if all five high numbers (8, 9, 10, 11, 12) are hit before a seven is rolled.

These bets pay 35-for-1, for a house advantage of 7.76%. &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; wins if the shooter hits all 10 numbers before a seven is rolled. This pays 176-for-1, for a house edge of 7.46%. For all three wagers, the order in which the numbers are hit does not matter. Whenever a seven is hit, including on the come out roll, all bonus bets lose, the bonus board is reset, and new bonus bets may be placed.

===Multiple different bets===
A player may wish to make multiple different bets. For example, a player may be wish to bet $1 on all hard ways and the horn. If one of the bets win the dealer may automatically replenish the losing bet with profits from the winning bet. In this example, if the shooter rolls a hard 8 (pays 9:1), the horn loses. The dealer may return $5 to the player and place the other $4 on the horn bet which lost. If the player does not want the bet replenished, he or she should request any or all bets be taken down.

===Working and not working bets===

A working bet is a live bet. Bets may also be on the board, but not in play and therefore not working. Pass line and come bets are always working meaning the chips are in play and the player is therefore wagering live money. Other bets may be working or not working depending whether a point has been established or player&#x27;s choice. Place and buy bets are working by default when a point is established and not working when the point is off unless the player specifies otherwise. Lay bets are always working even if a point has not been established unless the player requests otherwise. At any time, a player may wish to take any bet or bets out of play. The dealer will put an &quot;Off&quot; button on the player&#x27;s specific bet or bets; this allows the player to keep his chips on the board without a live wager. For example, if a player decides not to wager a place bet mid-roll but wishes to keep the chips on the number, he or she may request the bet be &quot;not working&quot; or &quot;Off&quot;. The chips remain on the table, but the player cannot win from or lose chips which are not working.

The opposite is also allowed. By default place and buy bets are not working without an established point; a player may wish to wager chips before a point has been established. In this case, the player would request the bet be working in which the dealer will place an &quot;On&quot; button on the specified chips.

=== Betting variants ===

These variants depend on the casino and the table, and sometimes a casino will have different tables that use or omit these variants and others.

* 11 is a point number instead of a natural. Rolling an 11 still pays &quot;Yo&quot; center-table bets, but the Pass line does not automatically win (and the Don&#x27;t Pass line does not automatically lose) when 11 is rolled on the come-out. Making the point pays 3:1 on Pass/Come odds bets (1:3 on Don&#x27;t Pass/Come odds); all line bets are still even money. This substantially reduces the odds of a natural (from 8/36 to 6/36) and of making the point in general (since a 3:1 dog is added to the mix). All other things equal, the house edge on the Pass Line and Come bets for this play variation jumps dramatically to 9.75%.
* 12 pays 3:1 on the field. This is generally seen in rooms that have two different table minimums, on the tables with the higher minimums. The lower minimum ones will then have 2:1 odds. For example, the Mirage casino in Las Vegas features 3:1 odds.
* 11 pays 2:1 on the field. This variant is normally used when 12 pays 3:1, and neutralizes the house edge on the field.
* Big 6/8 are unavailable. These bets are equivalent to placing or buying 6 or 8 as points, which have better payout for the same real odds, so Big 6/8 are rarely used and many casinos simply omit them from the layout. Casinos in Atlantic City are even prohibited by law from offering Big 6/8 bets.

==Optimal betting==

When craps is played in a casino, all bets have a house advantage. That is, it can be shown mathematically that a player will (with 100% probability) lose all his or her money to the casino in the long run, while in the short run the player is more likely to lose money than make money. There may be players who are lucky and get ahead for a period of time, but in the long run these winning streaks are eroded away. One can slow, but not eliminate, one&#x27;s average losses by only placing bets with the smallest house advantage.

The Pass/Don&#x27;t Pass line, Come/Don&#x27;t Come line, place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy 10 (only under the casino rules where commission is charged only on wins) have the lowest house edge in the casino, and all other bets will, on average, lose money between three and twelve times faster because of the difference in house edges.

The place bets and buy bets differ from the Pass line and come line, in that place bets and buy bets can be removed at any time, since, while they are multi-roll bets, their odds of winning do not change from roll to roll, whereas Pass line bets and come line bets are a combination of different odds on their first roll and subsequent rolls. The first roll of a Pass line bet is 2:1 advantage for the player (8 wins, 4 losses), but it is &quot;paid for&quot; by subsequent rolls that are at the same disadvantage to the player as the Don&#x27;t Pass bets were at an advantage. As such, they cannot profitably let the player take down the bet after the first roll. Players can bet or lay odds behind an established point depending on whether it was a Pass/Come or Don&#x27;t Pass/Don&#x27;t Come to lower house edge by receiving true odds on the point. Casinos which allow put betting allows players to increase or make new pass/come bets after the come-out roll. This bet generally has a higher house edge than place betting, unless the casino offers high odds.

Conversely, a player can take back (pick up) a Don&#x27;t Pass or Don&#x27;t Come bet after the first roll, but this cannot be recommended, because they already endured the disadvantaged part of the combination – the first roll. On that come-out roll, they win just 3 times (2 and 3), while losing 8 of them (7 and 11) and pushing one (12) out of the 36 possible rolls. On the other 24 rolls that become a point, their Don&#x27;t Pass bet is now to their advantage by 6:3 (4 and 10), 6:4 (5 and 9) and 6:5 (6 and 8). If a player chooses to remove the initial Don&#x27;t Come and/or Don&#x27;t Pass line bet, he or she can no longer lay odds behind the bet and cannot re-bet the same Don&#x27;t Pass and/or Don&#x27;t Come number (players must make a new Don&#x27;t Pass or come bets if desired). However, players can still make standard lay bets odds on any of the point numbers (4,5,6,8,9,10).

Among these, and the remaining numbers and possible bets, there are a myriad of systems and progressions that can be used with many combinations of numbers.

An important alternative metric is house advantage per roll (rather than per bet), which may be expressed in loss per hour. The typical pace of rolls varies depending on the number of players, but 102 rolls per hour is a cited rate for a nearly full table. This same reference states that only &quot;29.6% of total rolls are come out rolls, on average&quot;, so for this alternative metric, needing extra rolls to resolve the Pass line bet, for example, is factored. This number then permits calculation of rate of loss per hour, and per the 4 day/5 hour per day gambling trip:

* $10 Pass line bets 0.42% per roll, $4.28 per hour, $86 per trip
* $10 Place 6,8 bets 0.46% per roll, $4.69 per hour, $94 per trip
* $10 Place 5,9 bets 1.11% per roll, $11.32 per hour, $226 per trip
* $10 Place 4,10 bets 1.19% per roll, $12.14 per hour, $243 per trip
* $1 Single Hardways 2.78% per roll, $2.84 per hour, $56.71 per trip
* $1 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $11.34 per hour, $227 per trip
* $5 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $56.71 per hour, $1134 per trip
* $1 Craps only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per trip
* $1 Eleven only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per trip

==Table rules==
Besides the rules of the game itself, a number of formal and informal rules are commonly applied in the table form of Craps, especially when played in a casino.

To reduce the potential opportunity for switching dice by sleight-of-hand, players are not supposed to handle the dice with more than one hand (such as shaking them in cupped hands before rolling) nor take the dice past the edge of the table. If a player wishes to change shooting hands, they may set the dice on the table, let go, then take them with the other hand.

When throwing the dice, the player is expected to hit the farthest wall at the opposite end of the table (these walls are typically augmented with pyramidal structures to ensure highly unpredictable bouncing after impact). Casinos will sometimes allow a roll that does not hit the opposite wall as long as the dice are thrown past the middle of the table; a very short roll will be nullified as a &quot;no roll&quot;. The dice may not be slid across the table and must be tossed. These rules are intended to prevent dexterous players from physically influencing the outcome of the roll.

Players are generally asked not to throw the dice above a certain height (such as the eye level of the dealers). This is both for the safety of those around the table, and to eliminate the potential use of such a throw as a distraction device in order to cheat.

Dice are still considered &quot;in play&quot; if they land on players&#x27; bets on the table, the dealer&#x27;s working stacks, on the marker puck, or with one die resting on top of the other. The roll is invalid if either or both dice land in the boxman&#x27;s bank, the stickman&#x27;s bowl (where the extra three dice are kept between rolls), or in the rails around the top of the table where players chips are kept. If one or both dice hits a player or dealer and rolls back onto the table, the roll counts as long as the person being hit did not intentionally interfere with either of the dice, though some casinos will rule &quot;no roll&quot; for this situation. If one or both leave the table, it is also a &quot;no roll&quot;, and the dice may either be replaced or examined by the boxman and returned to play.

Shooters may wish to &quot;set&quot; the dice to a particular starting configuration before throwing (such as showing a particular number or combination, stacking the dice, or spacing them to be picked up between different fingers), but if they do, they are often asked to be quick about it so as not to delay the game. Some casinos disallow such rituals to speed up the pace of the game. Some may also discourage or disallow unsanitary practices such as kissing or spitting on the dice.

In most casinos, players are not allowed to hand anything directly to dealers, and vice versa. Items such as cash, checks, and chips are exchanged by laying them down on the table; for example, when &quot;buying in&quot; (paying cash for chips), players are expected to place the cash on the layout: the dealer will take it and then place the chips in front of the player. This rule is enforced in order to allow the casino to easily monitor and record all transfers via overhead surveillance cameras, and to reduce the opportunity for cheating via sleight-of-hand.

Most casinos prohibit &quot;call bets&quot;, and may have a warning such as &quot;No Call Bets&quot; printed on the layout to make this clear. This means a player may not call out a bet without also placing the corresponding chips on the table. Such a rule reduces the potential for misunderstanding in loud environments, as well as disputes over the amount that the player intended to bet after the outcome has been decided. Some casinos choose to allow call bets once players have bought-in. When allowed, they are usually made when a player wishes to bet at the last second, immediately before the dice are thrown, to avoid the risk of obstructing the roll.

== Etiquette ==
Craps is among the most social and most superstitious of all gambling games, which leads to an enormous variety of informal rules of etiquette that players may be expected to follow. An exhaustive list of these is beyond the scope of this article, but the guidelines below are most commonly given.

=== Tips ===
Tipping the dealers is universal and expected in Craps. As in most other casino games, a player may simply place (or toss) chips onto the table and say, &quot;For the dealers&quot;, &quot;For the crew&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot; In craps, it is also common to place a bet for the dealers. This is usually done one of three ways: by placing an ordinary bet and simply declaring it for the dealers, as a &quot;two-way&quot;, or &quot;on top&quot;. A &quot;Two-Way&quot; is a bet for both parties: for example, a player may toss in two chips and say &quot;Two Way Hard Eight&quot;, which will be understood to mean one chip for the player and one chip for the dealers. Players may also place a stack of chips for a bet as usual, but leave the top chip off-center and announce &quot;on top for the dealers&quot;. The dealer&#x27;s portion is often called a &quot;toke&quot; bet, which comes from the practice of using $1 slot machine tokens to place dealer bets in some casinos.

In some cases, players may also tip each other, for example as a show of gratitude to the thrower for a roll on which they win a substantial bet.

=== Superstition ===
Craps players routinely practice a wide range of superstitious behaviors, and may expect or demand these from other players as well.

Most prominently, it is universally considered bad luck to say the word &quot;seven&quot; (after the &quot;come-out&quot;, a roll of 7 is a loss for &quot;pass&quot; bets). Dealers themselves often make significant efforts to avoid calling out the number. When necessary, participants may refer to seven with a &quot;nickname&quot; such as &quot;Big Red&quot; (or just &quot;Red&quot;), &quot;the S-word&quot;, etc.

==Dice setting or dice control==

An approach to achieving an advantage is to &quot;set&quot; the dice in a particular orientation, and then throw them in such a manner that they do not tumble randomly. The theory is that given exactly the same throw from exactly the same starting configuration, the dice will tumble in the same way and therefore show the same or similar values every time.

Casinos take steps to prevent this. The dice are usually required to hit the back wall of the table, which is normally faced with a jagged angular texture such as pyramids, making controlled spins more difficult. There has been no independent evidence that such methods can be successfully applied in a real casino.

==Variants==
Bank craps is a variation of the original craps game and is sometimes known as Las Vegas Craps. This variant is quite popular in Nevada gambling houses, and its availability online has now made it a globally played game. Bank craps uses a special table layout and all bets must be made against the house. In Bank Craps, the dice are thrown over a wire or a string that is normally stretched a few inches from the table&#x27;s surface. The lowest house edge (for the Pass/Don&#x27;t Pass) in this variation is around 1.4%. Generally, if the word &quot;craps&quot; is used without any modifier, it can be inferred to mean this version of the game, to which most of this article refers.

Crapless craps, also known as bastard craps, is a simple version of the original craps game, and is normally played as an online private game. The biggest difference between crapless craps and original craps is that the shooter (person throwing the dice) is at a far greater disadvantage and has a house edge of 5.38%. Another difference is that this is one of the craps games in which a player can bet on rolling a 2, 3, 11 or 12 before a 7 is thrown. In crapless craps, 2 and 12 have odds of 11:2 and have a house edge of 7.143% while 3 and 11 have odds of 11:4 with a house edge of 6.25%.

New York Craps is one of the variations of craps played mostly in the Eastern coast of the US, true to its name. History states that this game was actually found and played in casinos in Yugoslavia, the UK and the Bahamas. In this craps variant, the house edge is greater than Las Vegas Craps or Bank craps. The table layout is also different, and is called a double-end-dealer table. This variation is different from the original craps game in several ways, but the primary difference is that New York craps does not allow Come or Don&#x27;t Come bets. New York Craps Players bet on box numbers like 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10. The overall house edge in New York craps is 5%.

==Card-based variations==
In order to get around Californian laws barring the payout of a game being directly related to the roll of dice, Indian reservations have adapted the game to substitute cards for dice.

===Cards replacing dice===
To replicate the original dice odds exactly without dice or possibility of card-counting, one scheme uses two shuffle machines each with just one deck of Ace through 6 each. Each machine selects one of the 6 cards at random and this is the roll. The selected cards are replaced and the decks are reshuffled for the next roll.

In one variation, two shoes are used, each containing some number of regular card decks that have been stripped down to just the Aces and deuces through sixes. The boxman simply deals one card from each shoe and that is the roll on which bets are settled. Since a card-counting scheme is easily devised to make use of the information of cards that have already been dealt, a relatively small portion (less than 50%) of each shoe is usually dealt in order to protect the house.

In a similar variation, cards representing dice are dealt directly from a continuous shuffling machine (CSM). Typically, the CSM will hold approximately 264 cards, or 44 sets of 1 through 6 spot cards. Two cards are dealt from the CSM for each roll. The game is played exactly as regular craps, but the roll distribution of the remaining cards in the CSM is slightly skewed from the normal symmetric distribution of dice.

Even if the dealer were to shuffle each roll back into the CSM, the effect of buffering a number of cards in the chute of the CSM provides information about the skew of the next roll. Analysis shows this type of game is biased towards the Don&#x27;t Pass and Don&#x27;t Come bets. A player betting Don&#x27;t Pass and Don&#x27;t Come every roll and laying 10x odds receives a 2% profit on the initial Don&#x27;t Pass / Don&#x27;t Come bet each roll. Using a counting system allows the player to attain a similar return at lower variance.

===Cards mapping physical dice===

In this game variation, one red deck and one blue deck of six cards each (A through 6), and a red die and a blue die are used. Each deck is shuffled separately, usually by machine. Each card is then dealt onto the layout, into the 6 red and 6 blue numbered boxes. The shooter then shoots the dice. The red card in the red-numbered box corresponding to the red die, and the blue card in the blue-numbered box corresponding to the blue die are then turned over to form the roll on which bets are settled.

Another variation uses a red and a blue deck of 36 custom playing cards each. Each card has a picture of a two-die roll on it – from 1–1 to 6–6. The shooter shoots what looks like a red and a blue die, called &quot;cubes&quot;. They are numbered such that they can never throw a pair, and that the blue one will show a higher value than the red one exactly half the time. One such scheme could be 222555 on the red die and 333444 on the blue die.

One card is dealt from the red deck and one is dealt from the blue deck. The shooter throws the &quot;cubes&quot; and the color of the cube that is higher selects the color of the card to be used to settle bets. On one such table, an additional one-roll prop bet was offered: If the card that was turned over for the &quot;roll&quot; was either 1–1 or 6–6, the other card was also turned over. If the other card was the &quot;opposite&quot; (6–6 or 1–1, respectively) of the first card, the bet paid 500:1 for this 647:1 proposition.

And additional variation uses a single set of 6 cards, and regular dice. The roll of the dice maps to the card in that position, and if a pair is rolled, then the mapped card is used twice, as a pair.

==Rules of play against other players (&quot;Street Craps&quot;)==

Recreational or informal playing of craps outside of a casino is referred to as street craps or private craps. The most notable difference between playing street craps and bank craps is that there is no bank or house to cover bets in street craps. Players must bet against each other by covering or fading each other&#x27;s bets for the game to be played. If money is used instead of chips and depending on the laws of where it is being played, street craps can be an illegal form of gambling.

There are many variations of street craps. The simplest way is to either agree on or roll a number as the point, then roll the point again before rolling a seven. Unlike more complex proposition bets offered by casinos, street craps has more simplified betting options. The shooter is required to make either a Pass or a Don&#x27;t Pass bet if he wants to roll the dice. Another player must choose to cover the shooter to create a stake for the game to continue.

If there are several players, the rotation of the player who must cover the shooter may change with the shooter (comparable to a blind in poker). The person covering the shooter will always bet against the shooter. For example, if the shooter made a &quot;Pass&quot; bet, the person covering the shooter would make a &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass&quot; bet to win. Once the shooter is covered, other players may make Pass/Don&#x27;t Pass bets, or any other proposition bets, as long as there is another player willing to cover.

==In popular culture==

Due to the random nature of the game, in popular culture a &quot;crapshoot&quot; is often used to describe an action with an unpredictable outcome.

The prayer or invocation &quot;Baby needs a new pair of shoes!&quot; is associated with shooting craps.

===Floating craps===
Floating craps is an illegal operation of craps. The term &quot;floating&quot; refers to the practice of the game&#x27;s operators using portable tables and equipment to quickly move the game from location to location to stay ahead of the law enforcement authorities. The term may have originated in the 1930s when Benny Binion (later known for founding the downtown Las Vegas hotel Binion&#x27;s) set up an illegal craps game utilizing tables created from portable crates for the Texas Centennial Exposition.

The 1950 Broadway musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; features a major plot point revolving around a floating craps game.

In the 1950s and 1960s The Sands Hotel in Las Vegas had a craps table that floated in the swimming pool, as a joke reference to the notoriety of the term.

===Records===
A Golden Arm is a craps player who rolls the dice for longer than one hour without losing. Likely the first known Golden Arm was Oahu native Stanley Fujitake, who rolled 118 times without sevening out in 3 hours and 6 minutes at the California Hotel and Casino on May 28, 1989.

The current record for length of a &quot;hand&quot; (successive rounds won by the same shooter) is 154 rolls including 25 passes by Patricia DeMauro of New Jersey, lasting 4 hours and 18 minutes, at the Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on May 23–24, 2009. She bested by over an hour the record held for almost 20 years – that of Fujitake.

<doc id="6066" wikidata="Q76430" url="?curid=6066" title="Carl von Clausewitz">
<text>Carl Philipp Gottfried (or Gottlieb) von Clausewitz ( , ; 1 July 1780 – 16 November 1831) was a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the &quot;moral&quot; (in modern terms meaning psychological) and political aspects of waging war. His most notable work, (&quot;About War&quot;), though unfinished at his death, is considered a seminal treatise on military strategy and science.

Clausewitz stressed the multiplex interaction of diverse factors in war, noting how unexpected developments unfolding under the &quot;fog of war&quot; (i.e., in the face of incomplete, dubious, and often erroneous information and great fear, doubt, and excitement) call for rapid decisions by alert commanders. He saw history as a vital check on erudite abstractions that did not accord with experience. In contrast to the early work of Antoine-Henri Jomini, he argued that war could not be quantified or reduced to mapwork, geometry, and graphs. Clausewitz had many aphorisms, of which one of the most famous is, &quot;War is the continuation of policy with other means.&quot;

==Name==
Clausewitz&#x27;s Christian names are sometimes given in non-German sources as &quot;Karl&quot;, &quot;Carl Philipp Gottlieb&quot;, or &quot;Carl Maria&quot;. He spelled his own given name with a &quot;C&quot; in order to identify with the classical Western tradition; writers who use &quot;Karl&quot; are often seeking to emphasize their German (rather than European) identity. &quot;Carl Philipp Gottfried&quot; appears on Clausewitz&#x27;s tombstone. Nonetheless, sources such as military historian Peter Paret and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; continue to use Gottlieb instead of Gottfried.

==Life and military career==
Clausewitz was born on 1 July 1780 in Burg bei Magdeburg in the Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg as the fourth and youngest son of a family that made claims to a noble status which Carl accepted. Clausewitz&#x27;s family claimed descent from the Barons of Clausewitz in Upper Silesia, though scholars question the connection. His grandfather, the son of a Lutheran pastor, had been a professor of theology. Clausewitz&#x27;s father, once a lieutenant in the army of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, held a minor post in the Prussian internal-revenue service. Clausewitz entered the Prussian military service at the age of twelve as a lance corporal, eventually attaining the rank of major general.

Clausewitz served in the Rhine campaigns (1793–1794) including the siege of Mainz, when the Prussian Army invaded France during the French Revolution, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars from 1806 to 1815. He entered the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; (also cited as &quot;The German War School&quot;, the &quot;Military Academy in Berlin&quot;, and the &quot;Prussian Military Academy,&quot; later the &quot;War College&quot;) in Berlin in 1801 (aged 21), probably studied the writings of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and/or Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schleiermacher and won the regard of General Gerhard von Scharnhorst, the future first chief-of-staff of the newly reformed Prussian Army (appointed 1809). Clausewitz, Hermann von Boyen (1771–1848) and Karl von Grolman (1777–1843) were among Scharnhorst&#x27;s primary allies in his efforts to reform the Prussian army between 1807 and 1814.

Clausewitz served during the Jena Campaign as aide-de-camp to Prince August. At the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October 1806—when Napoleon invaded Prussia and defeated the Prussian-Saxon army commanded by Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick—he was captured, one of the 25,000 prisoners taken that day as the Prussian army disintegrated. He was 26. Clausewitz was held prisoner with his prince in France from 1807 to 1808. Returning to Prussia, he assisted in the reform of the Prussian army and state. Johann Gottlieb Fichte wrote &quot;On Machiavelli, as an Author, and Passages from His Writings&quot; in June 1807. (&quot;Über Machiavell, als Schriftsteller, und Stellen aus seinen Schriften&quot; ). Carl Clausewitz wrote an interesting and anonymous Letter to Fichte (1809) about his book on &quot;Machiavelli.&quot; The letter was published in Fichte&#x27;s &quot;Verstreute kleine Schriften&quot; 157–166. For an English translation of the letter see &quot;Carl von Clausewitz Historical and Political Writings&quot; Edited by: Peter Paret and D. Moran (1992).
On 10 December 1810, he married the socially prominent Countess Marie von Brühl, whom he had first met in 1803. She was a member of the noble German Brühl family originating in Thuringia. The couple moved in the highest circles, socialising with Berlin&#x27;s political, literary, and intellectual élite. Marie was well-educated and politically well-connected—she played an important role in her husband&#x27;s career progress and intellectual evolution. She also edited, published, and introduced his collected works.

Opposed to Prussia&#x27;s enforced alliance with Napoleon, Clausewitz left the Prussian army and served in the Imperial Russian Army from 1812 to 1813 during the Russian campaign, taking part in the Battle of Borodino (1812). Like many Prussian officers serving in Russia, he joined the Russian–German Legion in 1813. In the service of the Russian Empire, Clausewitz helped negotiate the Convention of Tauroggen (1812), which prepared the way for the coalition of Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom that ultimately defeated Napoleon and his allies.

In 1815 the Russian-German Legion became integrated into the Prussian Army and Clausewitz re-entered Prussian service as a colonel. He was soon appointed chief-of-staff of Johann von Thielmann&#x27;s III Corps. In that capacity he served at the Battle of Ligny and the Battle of Wavre during the Waterloo campaign in 1815. An army led personally by Napoleon defeated the Prussians at Ligny (south of Mont-Saint-Jean and the village of Waterloo) on 16 June 1815, but they withdrew in good order. Napoleon&#x27;s failure to destroy the Prussian forces led to his defeat a few days later at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), when the Prussian forces arrived on his right flank late in the afternoon to support the Anglo-Dutch-Belgian forces pressing his front. Napoleon had convinced his troops that the field grey uniforms were those of Marshal Grouchy&#x27;s grenadiers. Clausewitz&#x27;s unit fought heavily outnumbered at Wavre (18–19 June 1815), preventing large reinforcements from reaching Napoleon at Waterloo. After the war, Clausewitz served as the director of the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;, where he served until 1830. In that year he returned to active duty with the army. Soon afterward, the outbreak of several revolutions around Europe and a crisis in Poland appeared to presage another major European war. Clausewitz was appointed chief of staff of the only army Prussia was able to mobilise in this emergency, which was sent to the Polish border. Its commander, Gneisenau, died of cholera (August 1831), and Clausewitz took command of the Prussian army&#x27;s efforts to construct a to contain the great cholera outbreak (the first time cholera had appeared in modern heartland Europe, causing a continent-wide panic). Clausewitz himself died of the same disease shortly afterwards, on 16 November 1831.

His widow edited, published, and wrote the introduction to his &quot;magnum opus&quot; on the philosophy of war in 1832. (He had started working on the text in 1816 but had not completed it.) She wrote the preface for &quot;On War&quot; and had published most of his collected works by 1835. She died in January 1836.

==Theory of war==
Clausewitz was a professional combat soldier and a staff officer who was involved in numerous military campaigns, but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination of war, utilising the campaigns of Frederick the Great and Napoleon as frames of reference for his work. He wrote a careful, systematic, philosophical examination of war in all its aspects. The result was his principal book, &quot;On War&quot;, a major work on the philosophy of war. It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution, producing some significant contradictions between different sections. The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate as to the exact meaning behind some seemingly contradictory observations in discussions pertinent to the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war, for example (though many of these apparent contradictions are simply the result of his dialectical method). Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments, to include more material on &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; and forms of war other than high-intensity warfare between states, but relatively little of this material was included in the book. Soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects, but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of those written by Clausewitz and Leo Tolstoy, both of whom were inspired by the events of the Napoleonic Era.

Clausewitz&#x27;s work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance. More than sixteen major English-language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014, whereas his 19th-century rival Jomini has faded from influence. The historian Lynn Montross said that this outcome &quot;may be explained by the fact that Jomini produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy. The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.&quot; Jomini did not attempt to define war but Clausewitz did, providing (and dialectically comparing) a number of definitions. The first is his dialectical thesis: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot; The second, often treated as Clausewitz&#x27;s &#x27;bottom line,&#x27; is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis: &quot;War is merely the continuation of policy with other means.&quot; The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous &quot;trinity,&quot; saying that war is &quot;a fascinating trinity—composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; the play of chance and probability, within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to pure reason.&quot; Christopher Bassford says the best shorthand for Clausewitz&#x27;s trinity should be something like &quot;violent emotion/chance/rational calculation.&quot; However, it is frequently presented as &quot;people/army/government,&quot; a misunderstanding based on a later paragraph in the same section. This misrepresentation was popularised by U.S. Army Colonel Harry Summers&#x27; Vietnam-era interpretation, facilitated by weaknesses in the 1976 Howard/Paret translation.

The degree to which Clausewitz managed to revise his manuscript to reflect that synthesis is the subject of much debate. His final reference to war and &quot;Politik&quot;, however, goes beyond his widely quoted antithesis: &quot;War is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means. We deliberately use the phrase &#x27;with the addition of other means&#x27; because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different. In essentials that intercourse continues, irrespective of the means it employs. The main lines along which military events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.&quot;

Clausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy, military instruction, and operational planning. He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on deep historical research. His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was 25, of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In &quot;On War&quot;, Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context, and also as a socio-political phenomenon. He also stressed the complex nature of war, which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy. (One should be careful not to limit his observations on war to war between states, however, as he certainly discusses other kinds of protagonists). Clausewitz, according to Azar Gat, expressed in the field of military theory the main themes of the Romantic reaction against the worldview of the Enlightenment, rejecting universal principles and stressing historical diversity and the forces of the human spirit. This explains the strength and value of many of his arguments, derived from this great cultural movement, but also his often harsh rhetoric against his predecessors.

The word &quot;strategy&quot; had only recently come into usage in modern Europe, and Clausewitz&#x27;s definition is quite narrow: &quot;the use of engagements for the object of war&quot; (which many today would call &quot;the operational level&quot; of war). Clausewitz conceived of war as a political, social, and military phenomenon which might—depending on circumstances—involve the entire population of a political entity at war. In any case, Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of their policy, in a dialectic between opposing wills, each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy.

Clausewitz&#x27;s emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defense suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures. The inherent superiority of the defense obviously does not mean that the defender will always win, however: there are other asymmetries to be considered. He was interested in co-operation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces, or citizen soldiers, as one possible—sometimes the only—method of defense. In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and those with Napoleon, which were energised by a rising spirit of nationalism, he emphasised the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war. This point is especially important, as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratisation of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democratised politics.

While Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels, he was also very skeptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence: &quot;Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain... In short, most intelligence is false.&quot; This circumstance is generally described as part of the fog of war. Such skeptical comments apply only to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels; at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence. His conclusions were influenced by his experiences in the Prussian Army, which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleon&#x27;s system but even more simply to the nature of war. Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realization of any plan, and the &quot;fog of war&quot; hinders commanders from knowing what is happening. It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius (), evidenced above all in the execution of operations. &#x27;Military genius&#x27; is not simply a matter of intellect, but a combination of qualities of intellect, experience, personality, and temperament (and there are many possible such combinations) that create a very highly developed mental aptitude for the waging of war.

===Principal ideas===
Key ideas discussed in &quot;On War&quot; include:
* the dialectical approach to military analysis
* the methods of &quot;critical analysis&quot;
* the economic profit-seeking logic of commercial enterprise is equally applicable to the waging of war and negotiating for peace
* the nature of the balance-of-power mechanism
* the relationship between political objectives and military objectives in war
* the asymmetrical relationship between attack and defense
* the nature of &quot;military genius&quot; (involving matters of personality and character, beyond intellect)
* the &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; (&quot;wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit&quot;) of war
* philosophical distinctions between &quot;absolute war,&quot; &quot;ideal war,&quot; and &quot;real war&quot;
* in &quot;real war,&quot; the distinctive poles of a) limited objectives (political and/or military) and b) war to &quot;render the enemy helpless&quot;
* the idea that war and its conduct belong fundamentally to the social realm rather than to the realms of art or science
* &quot;strategy&quot; belongs primarily to the realm of art, but is constrained by quantitative analyses of political benefits versus military costs &amp; losses
* &quot;tactics&quot; belongs primarily to the realm of science (most obvious in the development of siege warfare)
* the importance of &quot;moral forces&quot; (more than simply &quot;morale&quot;) as opposed to quantifiable physical elements
* the &quot;military virtues&quot; of professional armies (which do not necessarily trump the rather different virtues of other kinds of fighting forces)
* conversely, the very real effects of a superiority in numbers and &quot;mass&quot;
* the essential unpredictability of war
* the &quot;fog of war&quot;
* &quot;friction&quot; – the disparity between the ideal performance of units, organisations or systems and their actual performance in real-world scenarios (Book I, Chapter VII)
* strategic and operational &quot;centers of gravity&quot;
* the &quot;culminating point of the offensive&quot;
* the &quot;culminating point of victory&quot;

==Interpretation and misinterpretation==
Clausewitz used a dialectical method to construct his argument, leading to frequent misinterpretation of his ideas. British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart contends that the enthusiastic acceptance by the Prussian military establishment—especially Moltke the Elder, a former student of Clausewitz—of what they believed to be Clausewitz&#x27;s ideas, and the subsequent widespread adoption of the Prussian military system worldwide, had a deleterious effect on military theory and practice, due to their egregious misinterpretation of his ideas:

As described by Christopher Bassford, then-professor of strategy at the National War College of the United States:

Another example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of total war as used in the Third Reich&#x27;s propaganda in the 1940s. In fact, Clausewitz never used the term &quot;total war&quot;: rather, he discussed &quot;absolute war,&quot; a concept which evolved into the much more abstract notion of &quot;ideal war&quot; discussed at the very beginning of —the purely &quot;logical&quot; result of the forces underlying a &quot;pure,&quot; Platonic &quot;ideal&quot; of war. In what he called a &quot;logical fantasy,&quot; war cannot be waged in a limited way: the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory. But in the &quot;real world,&quot; he said, such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous. As a practical matter, the military objectives in &quot;real&quot; war that support political objectives generally fall into two broad types: limited aims or the effective &quot;disarming&quot; of the enemy &quot;to render [him] politically helpless or militarily impotent. Thus, the complete defeat of the enemy may not be necessary, desirable, or even possible.

According to Azar Gat, the opposing interpretations of Clausewitz are rooted in Clausewitz’s own conceptual journey. The centerpiece of Clausewitz’s theory of war throughout his life was his concept of all-out fighting and energetic conduct leading to the great battle of annihilation. He believed such conduct expressed the very “nature”, or “lasting spirit” of war. Accordingly, Clausewitz disparaged the significance of the maneuver, surprise, and cunning in war, as distracting from the centrality of battle, and argued that defense was legitimate only if and as long as one was weaker than the enemy. Nevertheless, in the last years of his life, after the first six out of the eight books of &quot;On War&quot; had already been drafted, Clausewitz came to recognize that this concept was not universal and did not even apply to the Napoleonic Wars, the supreme model of his theory of war. This was demonstrated by the Spanish and Russian campaigns and by guerrilla warfare, in all of which battle was systematically avoided. Consequently, from 1827 on, Clausewitz recognized the legitimacy of limited war and explained it by the influence of politics that harnessed the unlimited nature of war to serve its objectives. Clausewitz died in 1831 before he completed the revision he planned along these lines. He incorporated his new ideas only into the end of Book VI, Book VIII and the beginning of Book I of &quot;On War&quot;. As a result, when published, &quot;On War&quot; encompassed both his old and new ideas, at odds with each other.

Thus, against common interpretations of &quot;On War&quot;, Gat points out that Clausewitz’s transformed views regarding the relationship between politics and war and the admission of limited war into his theory constituted a U-turn against his own life-long fundamental view of the nature of war. Gat further argues the readers’ miscomprehension of the theory in &quot;On War&quot; as complete and dialectical, rather than a draft undergoing a radical change of mind, has thus generated a range of reactions. People of each age have found in &quot;On War&quot; the Clausewitz who suited their own views on war and its conduct. Between 1870 and 1914, he was celebrated mainly for his insistence on the clash of forces and the decisive battle, and his emphasis on moral forces. By contrast, after 1945, during the nuclear age, his reputation has reached a second pinnacle for his later acceptance of the primacy of politics and the concept of limited war.

Referring to much of the current interpretation of &quot;On War&quot; as the Emperor’s New Clothes syndrome, Gat argues that instead of critically addressing the puzzling contradictions in &quot;On War,&quot; Clausewitz has been set in stone and could not be wrong.

In modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of much dispute. One analysis was that of Panagiotis Kondylis, a Greek writer and philosopher, who opposed the interpretations of Raymond Aron in &quot;Penser la Guerre, Clausewitz,&quot; and other liberal writers. According to Aron, Clausewitz was one of the first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war-proneness, based on Clausewitz&#x27;s argument that &quot;war is a continuation of policy by other means.&quot; In &quot;Theory of War,&quot; Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought. He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war (though this probably reflects a lack of familiarity with personal letters from Clausewitz, which demonstrate an acute awareness of war&#x27;s tragic aspects) and that his advice regarding politics&#x27; dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifist ideas.

Other notable writers who have studied Clausewitz&#x27;s texts and translated them into English are historians Peter Paret of the Institute for Advanced Study and Sir Michael Howard. Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of &quot;On War&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1976/1984) and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists, such as Tolstoy. Bernard Brodie&#x27;s &quot;A Guide to the Reading of &quot;On War,&quot;&quot; in the 1976 Princeton translation, expressed his interpretations of the Prussian&#x27;s theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work. The 1873 translation by Colonel James John Graham was heavily—and controversially—edited by the philosopher, musician, and game theorist Anatol Rapoport.

The British military historian John Keegan attacked Clausewitz&#x27;s theory in his book &quot;A History of Warfare&quot;. Keegan argued that Clausewitz assumed the existence of states, yet &#x27;war antedates the state, diplomacy and strategy by many millennia.&#x27;

==Influence==
Clausewitz died without completing &quot;Vom Kriege,&quot; but despite this his ideas have been widely influential in military theory and have had a strong influence on German military thought specifically. Later Prussian and German generals, such as Helmuth Graf von Moltke, were clearly influenced by Clausewitz: Moltke&#x27;s widely quoted statement that &quot;No operational plan extends with high certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy force&quot; is a classic reflection of Clausewitz&#x27;s insistence on the roles of chance, friction, &quot;fog,&quot; uncertainty, and interactivity in war.

Clausewitz&#x27;s influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as a historian and analyst than as a theorist. See for example Wellington&#x27;s extended essay discussing Clausewitz&#x27;s study of the Campaign of 1815—Wellington&#x27;s only serious written discussion of the battle, which was widely discussed in 19th-century Britain. Clausewitz&#x27;s broader thinking came to the fore following Britain&#x27;s military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899–1902). One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is Spenser Wilkinson, journalist, the first Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from until well into the interwar period. Another is naval historian Julian Corbett (1854–1922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz&#x27;s concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz&#x27;s ideas about &#x27;limited objectives&#x27; and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war. Corbett&#x27;s practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson&#x27;s—see, for example, Wilkinson&#x27;s article &quot;Strategy at Sea&quot;, &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, 12 February 1912. Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator B. H. Liddell Hart in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of &quot;total war&quot; that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British. More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of &quot;On War.&quot; That view assumes, however, a set of values as to what constitutes &quot;rational&quot; political objectives—in this case, values not shaped by the fervid Social Darwinism that was rife in 1914 Europe. One of the most influential British Clausewitzians today is Colin S. Gray; historian Hew Strachan (like Wilkinson also the Chichele Professor of Military History at Oxford University, since 2001) has been an energetic proponent of the &quot;study&quot; of Clausewitz, but his own views on Clausewitz&#x27;s ideas are somewhat ambivalent.

With some interesting exceptions (e.g., John McAuley Palmer, Robert M. Johnston, Hoffman Nickerson), Clausewitz had little influence on American military thought before 1945 other than via British writers, though Generals Eisenhower and Patton were avid readers of English translations. He did influence Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Võ Nguyên Giáp, Ferdinand Foch, and Mao Zedong, and thus the Communist Soviet and Chinese traditions, as Lenin emphasized the inevitability of wars among capitalist states in the age of imperialism and presented the armed struggle of the working class as the only path toward the eventual elimination of war. Because Lenin was an admirer of Clausewitz and called him &quot;one of the great military writers,&quot; his influence on the Red Army was immense. The Russian historian A.N. Mertsalov commented that &quot;It was an irony of fate that the view in the USSR was that it was Lenin who shaped the attitude towards Clausewitz, and that Lenin&#x27;s dictum that war is a continuation of politics is taken from the work of this [allegedly] anti-humanist anti-revolutionary.&quot; The American mathematician Anatol Rapoport wrote in 1968 that Clausewitz as interpreted by Lenin formed the basis of all Soviet military thinking since 1917, and quoted the remarks by Marshal V.D. Sokolovsky:

Henry A. Kissinger, however, described Lenin&#x27;s approach as being that politics is a continuation of war by other means, thus turning Clausewitz&#x27;s argument &quot;on its head.&quot;

Rapoport argued that:

Clausewitz directly influenced Mao Zedong, who read &quot;On War&quot; in 1938 and organised a seminar on Clausewitz for the Party leadership in Yan&#x27;an. Thus the &quot;Clausewitzian&quot; content in many of Mao&#x27;s writings is not merely a regurgitation of Lenin but reflects Mao&#x27;s own study. The idea that war involves inherent &quot;friction&quot; that distorts, to a greater or lesser degree, all prior arrangements, has become common currency in fields such as business strategy and sport. The phrase &quot;fog of war&quot; derives from Clausewitz&#x27;s stress on how confused warfare can seem while one is immersed within it. The term center of gravity, used in a military context derives from Clausewitz&#x27;s usage, which he took from Newtonian mechanics. In U.S. military doctrine, &quot;center of gravity&quot; refers to the basis of an opponent&#x27;s power at the operational, strategic, or political level, though this is only one aspect of Clausewitz&#x27;s use of the term.

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
The deterrence strategy of the United States in the 1950s was closely inspired by President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s reading of Clausewitz as a young officer in the 1920s. Eisenhower was greatly impressed by Clausewitz&#x27;s example of a theoretical, idealized &quot;absolute war&quot; in &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; as a way of demonstrating how absurd it would be to attempt such a strategy in practice. For Eisenhower, the age of nuclear weapons had made what was for Clausewitz in the early-19th century only a theoretical vision an all too real possibility in the mid-20th century. From Eisenhower&#x27;s viewpoint, the best deterrent to war was to show the world just how appalling and horrific a nuclear &quot;absolute war&quot; would be if it should ever occur, hence a series of much-publicized nuclear tests in the Pacific, giving first priority in the defense budget to nuclear weapons and to their delivery-systems over conventional weapons, and making repeated statements in public that the United States was able and willing at all times to use nuclear weapons. In this way, through the massive retaliation doctrine and the closely related foreign-policy concept of brinkmanship, Eisenhower hoped to hold out a credible vision of Clausewitzian nuclear &quot;absolute war&quot; in order to deter the Soviet Union and/or China from ever risking a war or even conditions that might lead to a war with the United States.

After 1970, some theorists claimed that nuclear proliferation made Clausewitzian concepts obsolete after the 20th-century period in which they dominated the world. John E. Sheppard Jr., argues that by developing nuclear weapons, state-based conventional armies simultaneously both perfected their original purpose, to destroy a mirror image of themselves, and made themselves obsolete. No two powers have used nuclear weapons against each other, instead using diplomacy, conventional means, or proxy wars to settle disputes. If such a conflict did occur, presumably both combatants would be annihilated. Heavily influenced by the war in Vietnam and by antipathy to American strategist Henry Kissinger, the American biologist, musician, and game-theorist Anatol Rapoport argued in 1968 that a Clausewitzian view of war was not only obsolete in the age of nuclear weapons, but also highly dangerous as it promoted a &quot;zero-sum paradigm&quot; to international relations and a &quot;dissolution of rationality&quot; amongst decision-makers.

The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century have seen many instances of state armies attempting to suppress insurgencies and terrorism, and engaging in other forms of asymmetrical warfare. Clausewitz did not focus solely on wars between countries with well-defined armies. The era of the French Revolution and Napoleon was full of revolutions, rebellions, and violence by &quot;non-state actors&quot; - witness the wars in the French Vendée and in Spain. Clausewitz wrote a series of &quot;Lectures on Small War&quot; and studied the rebellion in the Vendée (1793–1796) and the Tyrolean uprising of 1809. In his famous &quot;Bekenntnisdenkschrift&quot; of 1812 he called for a &quot;Spanish war in Germany&quot; and laid out a comprehensive guerrilla strategy to be waged against Napoleon. In &quot;On War&quot; he included a famous chapter on &quot;The People in Arms&quot;.

One prominent critic of Clausewitz is the Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld. In his 1991 book &quot;The Transformation of War&quot;, Creveld argued that Clausewitz&#x27;s famous &quot;Trinity&quot; of people, army, and government was an obsolete socio-political construct based on the state, which was rapidly passing from the scene as the key player in war, and that he (Creveld) had constructed a new &quot;non-trinitarian&quot; model for modern warfare. Creveld&#x27;s work has had great influence. Daniel Moran replied, &#x27;The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz&#x27;s famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld, who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War, by which he means, incomprehensibly, a war of &#x27;state against state and army against army,&#x27; from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded.&quot; Christopher Bassford went further, noting that one need only &quot;read&quot; the paragraph in which Clausewitz defined his Trinity to see &quot;that the words &#x27;people,&#x27; &#x27;army,&#x27; and &#x27;government&#x27; appear nowhere at all in the list of the Trinity&#x27;s components... Creveld&#x27;s and Keegan&#x27;s assault on Clausewitz&#x27;s Trinity is not only a classic &#x27;blow into the air,&#x27; i.e., an assault on a position Clausewitz doesn&#x27;t occupy. It is also a pointless attack on a concept that is quite useful in its own right. In any case, their failure to read the actual wording of the theory they so vociferously attack, and to grasp its deep relevance to the phenomena they describe, is hard to credit.&quot;

Some have gone further and suggested that Clausewitz&#x27;s best-known aphorism, that war is a continuation of policy with other means, is not only irrelevant today but also inapplicable historically. For an opposing view see the sixteen essays presented in &quot;Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century&quot; edited by Hew Strachan and Andreas Herberg-Rothe.

In military academies, schools, and universities worldwide, Clausewitz&#x27;s &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; is often (usually in translation) mandatory reading.

Some theorists of management look to Clausewitz - just as some look to Sun Tzu - to bolster ideas on the concept of leadership.
