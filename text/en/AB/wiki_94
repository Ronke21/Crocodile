<text>Edward Vincent Sullivan (September 28, 1901 – October 13, 1974) was an American television host, impresario, sports and entertainment reporter, and syndicated columnist for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. He was the creator and host of the television variety program &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, which in 1955 was renamed &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Broadcast from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in U.S. broadcast history. &quot;It was, by almost any measure, the last great American TV show&quot;, said television critic David Hinckley. &quot;It&#x27;s one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories.&quot;

Sullivan was a broadcasting pioneer during the early years of American television. As critic David Bianculli wrote, &quot;Before MTV, Sullivan presented rock acts. Before Bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. Before the Comedy Channel, even before there was &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. Before there were 500 channels, before there was cable, Ed Sullivan was where the choice was. From the start, he was indeed &#x27;the Toast of the Town&#x27;.&quot; In 1996, Sullivan was ranked number 50 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Sullivan was born on September 28, 1901, in Harlem, New York City, to Elizabeth F. (née Smith) and Peter Arthur Sullivan, a customs house employee. His twin brother Daniel was sickly and lived only a few months. Sullivan was raised in Port Chester, New York, where the family lived in a small red brick home at 53 Washington Street. He was of Irish descent. The family loved music, frequently playing the piano, singing and playing phonograph records. Sullivan was a gifted athlete in high school, earning 12 athletic letters at Port Chester High School. He played football as a halfback, basketball as a guard and track as a sprinter. With the baseball team, Sullivan was a catcher and the team&#x27;s captain, leading the team to several championships. Sullivan noted that, in the state of New York, integration was taken for granted in high-school sports: &quot;When we went up into Connecticut, we ran into clubs that had Negro players. In those days this was accepted as commonplace; and so, my instinctive antagonism years later to any theory that a Negro wasn&#x27;t a worthy opponent or was an inferior person. It was just as simple as that.&quot;

Sullivan landed his first job at &quot;The Port Chester Daily Item&quot;, a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school and which he joined full-time after graduation. In 1919, he joined &quot;The Hartford Post&quot;, but the newspaper folded in his first week there. He next worked for &quot;The New York Evening Mail&quot; as a sports reporter. After the newspaper closed in 1923, he bounced through a series of news jobs with the Associated Press, the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;, &quot;The Morning World&quot;, &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The New York Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The Leader&quot;. In 1927, Sullivan joined The &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot;, first as a sports writer and then as a sports editor.

In 1929, when Walter Winchell moved to &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, Sullivan was named the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot;&#x27;s Broadway columnist. He left the paper for the city&#x27;s largest tabloid, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. His column, &quot;Little Old New York&quot;, concentrated on Broadway shows and gossip, and Sullivan also delivered showbusiness news broadcasts on radio. In 1933, Sullivan wrote and starred in the film &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;, in which he guided the audience around New York nightspots to meet entertainers and celebrities. Sullivan soon became a powerful force in the entertainment world and one of Winchell&#x27;s main rivals, setting the El Morocco nightclub in New York as his unofficial headquarters against Winchell&#x27;s seat of power at the nearby Stork Club. Sullivan continued writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; throughout his broadcasting career, and his popularity long outlived that of Winchell. In the late 1960s, Sullivan praised Winchell&#x27;s legacy in a magazine interview, leading to a major reconciliation between the longtime adversaries.

Throughout his career as a columnist, Sullivan had dabbled in entertainment, producing vaudeville shows with which he appeared as master of ceremonies in the 1920s and 1930s, directing a radio program over the original WABC and organizing benefit reviews for various causes.

==Radio==
In 1941, Sullivan became host of the &quot;Summer Silver Theater&quot;, a variety program on CBS, with Will Bradley as bandleader and a guest star featured each week.

==Television==
In 1948, producer Marlo Lewis convinced CBS to hire Sullivan to host a weekly Sunday-night television variety show, &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, which later became &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Debuting in June 1948, the show was originally broadcast from Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre on West 39th Street in New York. In January 1953, it moved to CBS-TV Studio 50 at 1697 Broadway, a former CBS Radio playhouse that in 1967 was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater (and was later the home of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;).

Television critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews. Harriet Van Horne alleged that &quot;he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having &quot;no&quot; personality.&quot; (The host wrote to the critic, &quot;Dear Miss Van Horne: You bitch. Sincerely, Ed Sullivan.&quot;) Sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, 20 years after his show&#x27;s debut, &quot;Time&quot; magazine asked, &quot;What exactly is Ed Sullivan&#x27;s talent?&quot; His mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from Bell&#x27;s palsy. &quot;Time&quot; in 1955 stated that Sullivan resembled &quot;a cigar-store Indian, the Cardiff Giant and a stone-faced monument just off the boat from Easter Island. He moves like a sleepwalker; his smile is that of a man sucking a lemon; his speech is frequently lost in a thicket of syntax; his eyes pop from their sockets or sink so deep in their bags that they seem to be peering up at the camera from the bottom of twin wells.&quot;

&quot;Yet,&quot; the magazine concluded, &quot;instead of frightening children, Ed Sullivan charms the whole family.&quot; Sullivan appeared to the audience as an average guy who brought the great acts of show business to their home televisions. &quot;Ed Sullivan will last&quot;, comedian Fred Allen said, &quot;as long as someone else has talent.&quot; Frequent guest Alan King said, &quot;Ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television.&quot; A typical show would feature a vaudeville act (such as acrobats, jugglers or magicians), one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a figure from the legitimate theater, an appearance by puppet Topo Gigio or a popular athlete. The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers appearing along with the American artists.

Sullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted and even encouraged impersonators such as John Byner, Frank Gorshin, Rich Little and especially Will Jordan to imitate him on his show. Johnny Carson also performed a fair impression, and even Joan Rivers imitated Sullivan&#x27;s unique posture. The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as &quot;And now, right here on our stage...&quot;, &quot;For all you youngsters out there...&quot; and &quot;a really big shew&quot; (his pronunciation of the word &quot;show&quot;). The latter phrase was in fact in the exclusive domain of his impressionists, as Sullivan never actually spoke the phrase &quot;really big show&quot; during the opening introduction of any episode in the entire history of the series. Jordan portrayed Sullivan in the films &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Down with Love&quot; and in the 1979 television movie &quot;Elvis&quot;.

Sullivan played himself, parodying his mannerisms as directed by Jerry Lewis, in Lewis&#x27; 1964 film &quot;The Patsy&quot;.

Sullivan inspired a song in the musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and in 1963 appeared as himself in the film.

In 1954, Sullivan appeared as a cohost on the television musical special &quot;General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;.

==Legacy==
Sullivan was quoted as saying: &quot;In the conduct of my own show, I&#x27;ve never asked a performer his religion, his race or his politics. Performers are engaged on the basis of their abilities. I believe that this is another quality of our show that has helped win it a wide and loyal audience.&quot; Although Sullivan was wary of Elvis Presley&#x27;s image and initially said that he would never book him, Presley became too big a name to ignore; in 1956, Sullivan signed him for three appearances. Six weeks earlier in August 1956, Sullivan and the show&#x27;s producer Robert Precht (who was also Sullivan&#x27;s son-in-law) were in a near fatal car accident near Sullivan&#x27;s country home in Southbury, Connecticut, and missed Presley&#x27;s first appearance on September 9, when Charles Laughton introduced Presley. After Sullivan came to know Presley personally, he made amends by telling his audience, &quot;This is a real decent, fine boy.&quot;


Sullivan&#x27;s failure to scoop the TV industry with Presley made him determined to book the next big sensation first. In November 1963, while at Heathrow Airport, Sullivan witnessed the Beatlemania spectacle as the band returned from Sweden and the terminal was overrun by screaming teens. At first Sullivan was reluctant to book the Beatles because the band did not yet have a commercially successful single in the U.S., but at the behest of his friend Sid Bernstein, Sullivan signed the group. Their initial Sullivan show appearance on February 9, 1964, was the most-watched program in TV history to that point. The Beatles appeared three more times in person and submitted filmed performances afterwards. The Dave Clark Five, who claimed a &quot;cleaner&quot; image than the Beatles, made 13 appearances on the show, more than any other UK group.

Unlike many shows of the time, Sullivan asked that most musical acts perform their music live, rather than lip-synching to their recordings. However, exceptions were made, such as when a microphone could not be placed close enough to a performer for technical reasons. An example was B.J. Thomas&#x27; 1969 performance of &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;, in which water was sprinkled on him as a special effect. In 1969, Sullivan presented the Jackson 5 with their first single &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, which ousted Thomas&#x27; song from the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Sullivan had an appreciation for Black entertainers. According to biographer Gerald Nachman, &quot;Most TV variety shows welcomed &#x27;acceptable&#x27; [B]lack superstars like Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey and Sammy Davis Jr. ... but in the early 1950s, long before it was fashionable, Sullivan was presenting the much more obscure [B]lack entertainers he had enjoyed in Harlem on his uptown rounds — legends like Peg Leg Bates, Pigmeat Markham and Tim Moore ... strangers to white America.&quot; He hosted pioneering TV appearances by Bo Diddley, the Platters, Brook Benton, Jackie Wilson, Fats Domino and numerous Motown acts including the Supremes, who appeared 17 times. As the critic John Leonard wrote, &quot;There wasn&#x27;t an important [B]lack artist who didn&#x27;t appear on Ed&#x27;s show.&quot;

Sullivan defied pressure to exclude Black entertainers or to avoid interacting with them on screen. &quot;Sullivan had to fend off his hard-won sponsor, Ford&#x27;s Lincoln dealers, after kissing Pearl Bailey on the cheek and daring to shake Nat King Cole&#x27;s hand,&quot; Nachman wrote. According to biographer Jerry Bowles, &quot;Sullivan once had a Ford executive thrown out of the theatre when he suggested that Sullivan stop booking so many [B]lack acts. And a dealer in Cleveland told him &#x27;We realize that you got to have niggers on your show. But do you have to put your arm around Bill &#x27;Bojangles&#x27; Robinson at the end of his dance?&#x27; Sullivan had to be physically restrained from beating the man to a pulp.&quot; Sullivan later raised money to help pay for Robinson&#x27;s funeral. At a CBS affiliates meeting in the late 1950s, several Southern station managers complained that Sullivan was booking too many &quot;negroes&quot;. Furious, Sullivan referred to the comments in his presentation and said that any station manager that feels this way is under no obligation to carry the show. There were no cancellations. Sullivan said: &quot;As a Catholic, it was inevitable that I would despise intolerance, because Catholics suffered more than their share of it. As I grew up, the causes of minorities were part and parcel of me. Negroes and Jews were the minority causes closest at hand. I need no urging to take a plunge in and help.&quot;

At a time when television had not yet embraced country and western music, Sullivan featured Nashville performers on his program. This in turn paved the way for shows such as &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and variety shows hosted by Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell and other country singers.

The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster made the most appearances of any act throughout the show&#x27;s run with 67 appearances between 1958 and 1969.

Sullivan appeared as himself on other television programs, including an April 1958 episode of the Howard Duff and Ida Lupino CBS situation comedy &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;. On September 14, 1958, Sullivan appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as a mystery guest. In 1961, Sullivan substituted for Red Skelton on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. Sullivan took Skelton&#x27;s roles in the various comedy sketches, with Skelton&#x27;s hobo character Freddie the Freeloader renamed Eddie the Freeloader.

==Personality==
Sullivan was quick to take offense if he felt that he had been crossed, and he could hold a grudge for a long time. As he told biographer Gerald Nachman, &quot;I&#x27;m a pop-off. I flare up, then I go around apologizing.&quot; &quot;Armed with an Irish temper and thin skin,&quot; wrote Nachman, &quot;Ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his coverage of, and devotion to, boxing.&quot; Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Jackie Mason, and Jim Morrison were parties to some of Sullivan&#x27;s most storied conflicts.

On November 20, 1955, African American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer and guitarist Bo Diddley appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, only to infuriate Sullivan. A reporter who was there at the time described what happened: &quot;Controversy raged at the CBS Studio 57, last Sunday ... in a verbal battle that started over one of the performer&#x27;s refusal to do a number on the telecast which Sullivan had requested. During the dress rehearsal, Bo Diddley ... agreed to do &quot;Sixteen Tons,&quot; as Marlo Lewis, Toast of the Town&#x27;s Executive Producer and Sullivan had requested. However, at 8:29 PM, as Sullivan went into commercial, the folk singer hurried to the side of Ray Block, musical director, to announce he had &#x27;changed his mind&#x27; and was going to do &quot;Diddley Daddy&quot;. After several attempts to get him to change his mind, CBS brass went into a hurried conference in attempt to synchronize the timing of the show with the longer number.&quot; Sullivan was enraged: &quot;You&#x27;re the first black boy that ever double-crossed me on the show,&quot; Diddley quoted him as saying. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have much to do with each other after that,&quot; he added. Later, Diddley resented that Elvis Presley, whom he accused of copying his revolutionary style and beat, received the attention and accolades on Sullivan&#x27;s show that he felt were rightfully his. &quot;I am owed,&quot; he said, &quot;and I never got paid.&quot; &quot;He might have,&quot; wrote Nachman, &quot;had things gone smoother with Sullivan.&quot;

Buddy Holly and the Crickets first appeared on the Sullivan show in 1957 to an enthusiastic response. For their second appearance in January 1958, Sullivan considered the lyrics of their chosen number &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; too suggestive, and ordered Holly to substitute another song. Holly responded that he had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; for them. Sullivan, unaccustomed to having his instructions questioned, angrily repeated them, but Holly refused to back down. Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, &quot;I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.&quot; Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan&#x27;s attitude, replied, &quot;I hope they&#x27;re damn more excited than I am.&quot; Sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced Holly&#x27;s name during the introduction. He also saw to it that Holly&#x27;s guitar amplifier volume was barely audible, except during his guitar solo. Nevertheless, the band was so well-received that Sullivan was forced to invite them back; Holly responded that Sullivan did not have enough money. Archival photographs taken during the appearance show Holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry Sullivan.

During Jackie Mason&#x27;s October 1964 performance on a show that had been shortened by ten minutes due to an address by President Lyndon Johnson, Sullivan—on-stage but off-camera—signaled Mason that he had two minutes left by holding up two fingers. Sullivan&#x27;s signal distracted the studio audience, and to television viewers unaware of the circumstances, it seemed as though Mason&#x27;s jokes were falling flat. Mason, in a bid to regain the audience&#x27;s attention, cried, &quot;I&#x27;m getting fingers here!&quot; and made his own frantic hand gesture: &quot;Here&#x27;s a finger for you!&quot; Videotapes of the incident are inconclusive as to whether Mason&#x27;s upswept hand (which was just off-camera) was intended to be an indecent gesture, but Sullivan was convinced that it was, and banned Mason from future appearances on the program. Mason later said that he did not know what the &quot;middle finger&quot; meant, and that he did not make the gesture anyway. In September 1965, Sullivan—who, according to Mason, was &quot;deeply apologetic&quot;—brought Mason on the show for a &quot;surprise grand reunion&quot;. &quot;He said they were old pals,&quot; Nachman wrote, &quot;news to Mason, who never got a repeat invitation.&quot; Mason added that his earning power &quot;...was cut right in half after that. I never really worked my way back until I opened on Broadway in 1986.&quot;

When the Byrds performed on December 12, 1965, David Crosby got into a shouting match with the show&#x27;s director. They were never asked to return.

Sullivan decided that &quot;Girl, we couldn&#x27;t get much higher&quot;, from the Doors&#x27; signature song &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, was too overt a reference to drug use, and directed that the lyric be changed to &quot;Girl, we couldn&#x27;t get much better&quot; for the group&#x27;s September 1967 appearance. The band members &quot;nodded their assent&quot;, according to Doors biographer Ben Fong-Torres, then sang the song as written. After the broadcast, producer Bob Precht told the group, &quot;Mr. Sullivan wanted you for six more shows, but you&#x27;ll never work the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; again.&quot; Jim Morrison replied, &quot;Hey, man, we just &quot;did&quot; the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.&quot;

The Rolling Stones famously capitulated during their fifth appearance on the show, in 1967, when Mick Jagger was told to change the titular lyric of &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; to &quot;Let&#x27;s spend some time together&quot;. &quot;But Jagger prevailed,&quot; wrote Nachman, by deliberately calling attention to the censorship, rolling his eyes, mugging, and drawing out the word &quot;t-i-i-i-me&quot; as he sang the revised lyric. Sullivan was angered by the insubordination, but the Stones did make one additional appearance on the show, in 1969.

Moe Howard of the Three Stooges recalled in 1975 that Sullivan had a memory problem of sorts: &quot;Ed was a very nice man, but for a showman, quite forgetful. On our first appearance, he introduced us as the Three Ritz Brothers. He got out of it by adding, &#x27;who look more like the Three Stooges to me&#x27;.&quot; Joe DeRita, who worked with the Stooges after 1959, had commented that Sullivan had a personality &quot;like the bottom of a bird cage.&quot;

Diana Ross, who was very fond of Sullivan, later recalled Sullivan&#x27;s forgetfulness during the many occasions the Supremes performed on his show. In a 1995 appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater), Ross stated, &quot;he could never remember our names. He called us &#x27;the girls&#x27;.&quot;

In a 1990 press conference, Paul McCartney recalled meeting Sullivan again in the early 1970s. Sullivan apparently had no idea who McCartney was. McCartney tried to remind Sullivan that he was one of the Beatles, but Sullivan obviously could not remember, and nodding and smiling, simply shook McCartney&#x27;s hand and left. In an interview with Howard Stern around 2012, Joan Rivers said that Sullivan had been suffering from dementia toward the end of his life.

==Politics==
Sullivan, like many American entertainers, was pulled into the Cold War anticommunism of the late 1940s and 1950s. Tap dancer Paul Draper&#x27;s scheduled January 1950 appearance on &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; met with opposition from Hester McCullough, an activist in the hunt for what she perceived as subversives. Branding Draper a Communist Party sympathizer, she demanded that Sullivan&#x27;s lead sponsor, the Ford Motor Company, cancel Draper&#x27;s appearance. Draper denied the charge, and appeared on the show as scheduled. Ford received over a thousand angry letters and telegrams, and Sullivan was obliged to promise Ford&#x27;s advertising agency, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, that he would avoid controversial guests going forward. Draper was forced to move to Europe to earn a living.

After the Draper incident, Sullivan began to work closely with Theodore Kirkpatrick of the anti-Communist &quot;Counterattack&quot; newsletter. He would consult Kirkpatrick if any questions came up regarding a potential guest&#x27;s political leanings. Sullivan wrote in his June 21, 1950, &quot;Daily News&quot; column that &quot;Kirkpatrick has sat in my living room on several occasions and listened attentively to performers eager to secure a certification of loyalty.&quot;

Cold War repercussions manifested in a different way when Bob Dylan was booked to appear in May 1963. His chosen song was &quot;Talkin&#x27; John Birch Paranoid Blues&quot;, which poked fun at the ultraconservative John Birch Society and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations. No concern was voiced by anyone, including Sullivan, during rehearsals; but on the day of the broadcast, CBS&#x27;s Standards and Practices department rejected the song, fearing that lyrics equating the Society&#x27;s views with those of Adolf Hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit. Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice, he would rather not appear at all. The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed. Sullivan denounced the network&#x27;s decision in published interviews.

Sullivan butted heads with Standards and Practices on other occasions, as well. In 1956, actress Ingrid Bergman was planning a return to Hollywood with the film &quot;Anastasia&quot; after living in exile in Europe since 1950 in the wake of her scandalous love affair with director Roberto Rossellini. Sullivan was confident that the American public would welcome her back, and invited her to appear on his show. He flew to Europe to film an interview with Bergman, Yul Brynner, and Helen Hayes on the &quot;Anastasia&quot; set. When Sullivan arrived back in New York, Standards and Practices informed him that under no circumstances would Bergman be permitted to appear on the show, either live or on film. However, Sullivan&#x27;s prediction about Bergman&#x27;s career later proved correct, as she won her second Academy Award for &quot;Anastasia&quot;, as well as the forgiveness of her fans.

==Personal life==
Sullivan was engaged to champion swimmer Sybil Bauer, but she died of cancer in 1927 at the age of 23.

In 1926, Sullivan met and began dating Sylvia Weinstein. Initially she told her family that she was dating a Jewish man named Ed Solomon, but her brother discovered it was Sullivan, who was Catholic. Both their families were strongly opposed to interfaith marriage, which resulted in a discontinuous relationship for the next three years. They were finally married on April 28, 1930, in a City Hall ceremony. Eight months later Sylvia gave birth to Elizabeth (&quot;Betty&quot;), named after Sullivan&#x27;s mother, who had died that year. In 1952, Betty Sullivan married the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;&#x27;s producer, Bob Precht.

The Sullivans rented a suite of rooms at the Hotel Delmonico in 1944 after living at the Hotel Astor on Times Square for many years. Sullivan rented a suite next door to the family suite, which he used as an office until &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was canceled in 1971. Sullivan habitually called his wife after every program to get her critique.

The Sullivans regularly dined and socialized at New York City&#x27;s best-known clubs and restaurants including the Stork Club, Danny&#x27;s Hide-A-Way, and Jimmy Kelly&#x27;s. His friends included celebrities and U.S. presidents. He also received audiences with popes.

Sylvia Sullivan was a financial advisor for her husband. She died on March 16, 1973, at Mount Sinai Hospital from a ruptured aorta.

==Later life and death==
In the fall of 1965, CBS began televising its weekly programs in color. Although the Sullivan show was seen live in the Central and Eastern time zones, it was taped for airing in the Pacific and Mountain time zones. Excerpts have been released on home video, and posted on the official Ed Sullivan Show YouTube Channel.

By 1971, the show&#x27;s ratings had plummeted. In an effort to refresh the CBS lineup, CBS cancelled the program in March 1971, along with some of its other long-running shows throughout the 1970–1971 season (later known as the rural purge). Angered, Sullivan refused to host three more months of scheduled shows. They were replaced by reruns, and a final program without him aired in June. He remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in June 1973.

In early September 1974, Sullivan was diagnosed with an advanced stage of esophageal cancer. Doctors gave him very little time to live, and the family chose to keep the diagnosis secret from him. Sullivan, a lifelong smoker, believed his ailment to be yet another complication from a long-standing battle with gastric ulcers. He died on October 13, 1974, at New York&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital. His funeral was attended by 2,000 people at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York, on a cold, rainy day. Sullivan is interred in a crypt at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

Sullivan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd. In 1985, Sullivan was welcomed to the Television Academy Hall of Fame.

<text>Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (; ; 16 April 1755 – 30 March 1842), also known as Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun or simply as Madame Le Brun, was a French painter who mostly specialized in portrait painting, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Her artistic style is generally considered part of the aftermath of Rococo with elements of an adopted Neoclassical style. Her subject matter and color palette can be classified as Rococo, but her style is aligned with the emergence of Neoclassicism. Vigée Le Brun created a name for herself in Ancien Régime society by serving as the portrait painter to Marie Antoinette. She enjoyed the patronage of European aristocrats, actors, and writers, and was elected to art academies in ten cities. Some famous contemporary artists, such as Joshua Reynolds, viewed her as one of the greatest portraitists of her time, comparing her with the old Dutch masters.

Vigée Le Brun created 660 portraits and 200 landscapes. In addition to many works in private collections, her paintings are owned by major museums, such as the Louvre in Paris, Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, National Gallery in London, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and many other collections in Europe and the United States. Her personal habitus was characterized by a high sensitivity to sound, sight and smell. Between 1835 and 1837, when Vigée Le Brun was in her eighties, with the help of her nieces Caroline Rivière and , she published her memoirs in three volumes (&quot;Souvenirs&quot;), some of which are in epistolary format. They also contain many pen portraits as well as advice for young portraitists.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born in Paris on 16 April 1755, Élisabeth Louise Vigée was the daughter of Jeanne (; 1728–1800), a hairdresser from a peasant background, and Louis Vigée (1715–1767), a portraitist, pastellist and member of the Académie de Saint-Luc, who mostly specialized in painting with oils. Élisabeth exhibited artistic inclinations from her childhood, making a sketch of a bearded man at the age of seven or eight; when he first saw her sketches her father was jubilant and exclaimed that &quot;You will be a painter my child, if there ever was one&quot;, and started to give her lessons in art. In 1760, at the age of five, she had entered a convent, where she remained until 1766. She then worked as an assistant to her father&#x27;s friend, the painter and poet Pierre Davesne, with whom she learned more about painting. Her father died when she was 12 years old, from infections after several surgical operations. In 1768, her mother married a wealthy but mean jeweller, Jacques-François Le Sèvre, and shortly after, the family moved to the Rue Saint-Honoré, close to the Palais Royal.

In her memoir, Vigée Le Brun directly stated her feelings about her stepfather: &quot;I hated this man; even more so since he made use of my father&#x27;s personal possessions. He wore his clothes, just as they were, without altering them to fit his figure.&quot; During this period, Élisabeth benefited from the advice of Gabriel François Doyen, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and Joseph Vernet, whose influence is evident in her portrait of her younger brother, playwright and poet Étienne Vigée.

After her father&#x27;s death, her mother sought to raise her spirits by taking her to the Palais de Luxembourg&#x27;s art gallery; seeing the works of Peter Paul Rubens and other old masters left a great impression on her. She also visited numerous private galleries, including those of Rendon de Boisset, the Duc de Praslin [fr], and the Marquis de Levis; the artist took notes and copied the works of old masters such as Van Dyke, Rubens and Rembrandt to improve her art. At an early age, she reversed the order of her given Christian names, and was known among her inner circle as &#x27;Louise&#x27;. For most of her life, she signed her paintings, documents and letters as &quot;Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun&quot;, although she acknowledged later in life that the correct baptismal order would be Élisabeth Louise.

By the time she was in her early teens, Élisabeth was painting portraits professionally. She greatly disliked the contemporary High Rococo fashion, and often solicited her sitters to allow her to alter their apparel. Inspired by Raphael and Domenichino, she often draped her subjects in shawls and long scarves; these styles would later become ubiquitous in her portraiture. After her studio was seized for her practicing without a license, she applied to the Académie de Saint-Luc, which unwittingly exhibited her works in its Salon. In 1774, she was made a member of the Académie. Her studio&#x27;s reputation saw a meteoric rise, and her renown spread outside France. By 1774, she had painted portraits which included those of the Comte Orloff, Comte Pierre Chouvaloff [ru] (one of Empress Elizabeth&#x27;s favorites), the Comtesse de Brionne [fr], the Duchess of Orléans (future mother of King Louis Philippe), the Marquis de Choiseul, and the Chancellor de Aguesseau, among many others. In 1776, she received her first royal commission, to paint the portrait of the Comte de Provence (the future King Louis XVIII).

After her stepfather retired from his business, he moved his family to the Hôtel de Lubert in Paris where she met Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Le Brun, a painter, art dealer and relation of the painter Charles Le Brun, on the Rue de Cléry where they lodged. Élisabeth visited M. Le Brun&#x27;s apartments frequently to view his private collection of paintings, which included examples from many different schools. He agreed to her request to borrow some of the paintings in order to copy them and improve her skills, which she saw as one of the greatest boons of artistic instruction she had received. After residing in the Hôtel de Lubert for six months, M. Le Brun asked for the artist&#x27;s hand in marriage. Élisabeth was in a dilemma as to whether to agree or refuse the offer; she had a steady source of income from her rising career as an artist and her future was secure; as such, she wrote, she had never contemplated marriage. On her mother&#x27;s urging and goaded by her desire to be separated from her stepfather&#x27;s worsening temperament, Élisabeth agreed, though her doubts were such that she was still hesitant on her wedding day on 11 January 1776; she was twenty years old. The wedding took place in great privacy in the Saint-Eustache church, with only two banns being read, and was kept secret for some time at the request of her husband, who was officially engaged to another woman at the time in an attempt to secure a lucrative art deal with a Dutch art dealer. Élisabeth acceded to his request as she was reluctant to give up her now famous maiden name. In 1778, she and her husband contracted to purchase the Hôtel de Lubert. In this same year, she became the official painter to the Queen.

During the two weeks after the wedding had taken place in secret, the artist was visited by a stream of people giving her ominous news regarding her husband, these people believing that she had still not agreed to his proposal. These visitors started with the court jeweller, followed by the Duchesse de Arenberg and Mme de Souza, the Portuguese ambassadress, who passed stories of M. Le Brun&#x27;s habits as a spendthrift and womanizer. Élisabeth would later regret this match as she found these rumors to be true, though she wrote that in spite of his faults he was still an agreeable and obliging man with a sweet nature. However, she frequently condemned his gambling and adulterous habits in her memoirs, as these left her in a financially critical position at the time of her flight from France. Her relationship with him deteriorated later so much that she demanded the refund of her dowry from M. Le Brun in 1802. Vigée Le Brun began exhibiting her work at their home, and the salons she held there supplied her with many new and important contacts.

Her husband&#x27;s great-great-uncle was Charles Le Brun, the first director of the French Academy under Louis XIV. Her husband appropriated most of her income and pressed her to also take on the role of a private tutor to increase his income from her. The artist found tutoring to be frustrating due to her inability to assert authority over her pupils, most of whom were older than her, and found the distraction from her work irritating; she renounced tutoring soon after she had begun.

==== Daughter Julie ====
After two years of marriage, Vigée Le Brun became pregnant, and on 12 February 1780, she gave birth to a daughter, Jeanne Lucie Louise, whom she called Julie and nicknamed &quot;Brunette&quot;. In 1784, she gave birth to a second child who died in infancy.

In 1781, she and her husband toured Flanders, Brussels and the Netherlands, where seeing the works of the Flemish masters inspired her to try new techniques. Her &quot;Self-portrait in a Straw Hat&quot; (1782) was a &quot;free imitation&quot; of Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Le Chapeau de Paille&quot;. Dutch and Flemish influences have also been noted in &quot;The Comte d&#x27;Espagnac&quot; (1786) and &quot;Madame Perregaux&quot; (1789).

In yet another of the series of scandals that marked her early career, her 1785 portrait of Louis XVI&#x27;s minister of finance, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, was the target of a public scandal after it was exhibited in the Salon of 1785. Rumors circulated that the minister had paid the artist a very large sum of money, while other rumors circulated that she had had an affair with de Calonne. The famous Paris Opera soprano Sophie Arnould commented on the portrait &quot;Madame Le Brun had cut off his legs so he could not escape&quot;. More rumors and scandals followed soon after as, to the painter&#x27;s dismay, M. Le Brun began building a mansion on the Rue de-Gros-Chenet, with the public claiming that de Calonne was financing the new home - although her husband did not finish constructing the house until 1801, shortly before her return to France after her long exile. She was also rumored to have had another affair, with Joseph Hyacinthe François de Paule de Rigaud, Comte de Vaudreuil, who was one of her most devoted patrons. Their correspondence published later strongly affirmed the status of this affair. These rumors spiraled into an extensive defamation campaign targeting the painter throughout 1785.

In 1787, she caused a minor public scandal when her &quot;Self-portrait with her Daughter Julie&quot; was exhibited at that year&#x27;s Salon showing her smiling and open-mouthed, which was in direct contravention of traditional painting conventions going back to antiquity. The court gossip-sheet &quot;Mémoires secrets&quot; commented: &quot;An affectation which artists, art-lovers and persons of taste have been united in condemning, and which finds no precedent among the Ancients, is that in smiling, [Madame Vigée LeBrun] shows her teeth.&quot; In light of this and her other &quot;Self-portrait with her Daughter Julie&quot; (1789), Simone de Beauvoir dismissed Vigée Le Brun as narcissistic in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949): &quot;Madame Vigée-Lebrun never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases.&quot;

In 1788, Vigée Le Brun was impressed with the faces of the Mysorean ambassadors of Tipu-Sultan, and solicited their approval to take their portraits. The ambassador responded by saying he would only agree if the request came from the King, which Vigée Le Brun procured, and she proceeded to paint the portrait of Dervish Khan, followed by a group portrait of the ambassador and his son. After finishing the portraits and leaving them with the ambassadors to dry, Vigée Le Brun sought their return in order to exhibit them in the Salon; one of the ambassadors refused the request, stating that a painting &quot;needs a soul&quot;, and hid the paintings behind his bed. Vigée Le Brun managed to secure the portraits through the ambassador&#x27;s valet, which enraged the ambassador to the point that he wished to kill his valet, but he was dissuaded from doing so as &quot;it was not custom in Paris to kill one&#x27;s valet&quot;. She falsely convinced the ambassador that the King wanted the portraits, and they were exhibited in the Salon of 1789. Unknown to the artist, these ambassadors were later executed upon their return to Mysore for failing in their mission to forge a military alliance with Louis XVI. After her husband&#x27;s death, the paintings were sold along with the remnants of his estate, and Vigée Le Brun did not know who possessed them at the time she wrote her memoirs.

=== Marie Antoinette ===

As her career blossomed, Vigée Le Brun was granted patronage by Marie Antoinette. She painted more than 30 portraits of the Queen and her family, leading to the common perception that she was the official portraitist of Marie Antoinette. At the Salon of 1783, Vigée Le Brun exhibited &quot;Marie-Antoinette in a Muslin Dress&quot; (1783), sometimes called &quot;Marie-Antoinette en Gaulle&quot;, in which the Queen chose to be shown in a simple, informal cotton muslin dress, worn as an undergarment. The resulting scandal was prompted by both the informality of the attire and the Queen&#x27;s decision to be shown in that way. Vigée Le Brun immediately had the portrait removed from the Salon and quickly repainted it, this time with the Queen in more formal attire. After this scandal, the prices of Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s paintings soared.

==== Marie Antoinette and her Children 1787 ====
Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s later &quot;Marie Antoinette and her Children&quot; (1787) was an attempt to improve the Queen&#x27;s image by making her more relatable to the public, in the hopes of countering the bad press and negative judgments that Marie Antoinette had recently received. The portrait shows the Queen at home in the Palace of Versailles, engaged in her official function as the mother of the King&#x27;s children, but also suggests Marie Antoinette&#x27;s uneasy identity as a foreign-born queen whose maternal role was her only true function under Salic law. The child, Louis Joseph, on the right is pointing to an empty cradle, which signified the Queen&#x27;s recent loss of a child, further emphasizing Marie Antoinette&#x27;s role as a mother. Vigée Le Brun was initially afraid of displaying this portrait due to the Queen&#x27;s unpopularity and fear of another negative reaction to it, to such a degree that she locked herself in at home and prayed incessantly for its success. However, she was soon greatly pleased at the positive reception for this group portrait, which was presented to the King by M. de Angevilliers, Louis XVI&#x27;s minister of arts. Vigée Le Brun herself was also presented to the King, who praised the painting and told her &quot;I know nothing about painting, but I grow to love it through you&quot;. The portrait was hung in the halls of Versailles, so that Marie Antoinette passed it on her way to mass, but it was taken down after the Dauphin&#x27;s death in 1789.

Later on, during the First Empire, she painted a posthumous portrait of the Queen ascending to heaven with two angels, alluding to the two children she had lost, and Louis XVI seated on two clouds. This painting was titled &quot;The Apotheosis of the Queen&quot;. It was displayed in the chapel of the Infirmerie Marie-Thérèse, rue Denfert-Rochereau, but vanished at some point in the 20th century. She also painted numerous other posthumous portraits of the Queen, and of King Louis XVI.

=== Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture ===
On 31 May 1783, Vigée Le Brun was received as a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. She was one of only 15 women to be granted full membership in the Académie between 1648 and 1793. Her rival, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, was admitted on the same day. Vigée Le Brun was initially refused on the grounds that her husband was an art dealer, but eventually the Académie was overruled by an order from Louis XVI because Marie Antoinette put considerable pressure on the King on behalf of her portraitist. As her reception piece, Vigée Le Brun submitted an allegorical painting, &quot;Peace Bringing Back Abundance&quot; (&quot;La Paix ramenant l&#x27;Abondance&quot;), instead of a portrait, even though she was not asked for a reception piece. As a consequence, the Académie did not place her work within a standard category of painting — either history or portraiture. Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s membership in the Académie was dissolved after the French Revolution because the category of female academicians was abolished.

=== Flight from France ===

Vigée Le Brun witnessed many of the events that accelerated the already rapid deterioration of the Ancien Régime. While travelling to Romainville to visit the Maréchal de Ségur in July 1788, the artist experienced the massive hailstorm that swept the country, and observed the resultant devastation of crops. As the turmoil of the French Revolution grew, the artist&#x27;s house on the Rue de-Gros-Chenet was harassed by &quot;sans-culottes&quot; due to her association with Marie Antoinette. Stricken with an intense anxiety, Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s health deteriorated. M. and Mme. Brongniart pleaded with her to live with them to convalesce and recover her health, to which she agreed and spent several days in their apartment at Les Invalides. Later in her life, in a letter to the Princess Kourakin, the artist wrote:

As the situation in Paris and France continued to deteriorate with the rising tide of the revolution, the artist decided to leave Paris, and obtained passports for herself, her daughter and their governess. The very next day a large band of national guards entered her house and ordered her not to leave or else face punishment. Two sympathetic national guards from her neighborhood later returned to her house, and advised her to leave the city as fast as possible, but to take the stagecoach instead of her carriage. Vigée Le Brun then ordered three places on the stagecoach out of Paris, but had to wait two weeks to obtain seats as there were many people departing the city. Vigée Le Brun visited her mother before leaving. On 5 October 1789, the King and Queen were driven from Versailles to the Tuilleries by a large crowd of Parisians – mostly women. Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s stagecoach departed at midnight of the same day, with her brother and husband accompanying them to the Barrière du Trône. She, her daughter and governess dressed shabbily to avoid attracting attention. Vigée Le Brun travelled to Lyon where she stayed for three days with acquaintances (Mme. and M. de Artaut), where she was barely recognized due to her changed features and shabby clothes, and then continued her journey across the Beauvoisin bridge, she was relieved to be finally out of France, although throughout her journey she was accompanied by Jacobin spies who tracked her movement. Her husband, who remained in Paris, claimed that Vigée Le Brun went to Italy &quot;to instruct and improve herself&quot;, but she feared for her own safety. In her 12-year absence from France, she lived and worked in Italy (1789–1792), Austria (1792–1795), Russia (1795–1801) and Germany (1801), and remained a committed royalist throughout her life.

==== Italy ====
The artist arrived in Turin after crossing the Savoyard Alps. In Turin, she met the famous engraver Porporati, who was now a professor in the city&#x27;s academy. Porporati and his daughter received the artist for five or six days until she resumed her journey southwards to Parma, where she met the Comte de Flavigny [fr] (then minister plenipotentiary of Louis XVI) who generously accommodated her during her stay there. While staying in Parma, she sought out churches and galleries that possessed works of the old master Correggio, whose painting &quot;The Manger,&quot; or &quot;Nativity&quot; had captivated her when she first saw it in the Louvre. She visited the church of San Giovanni to observe the ceilings and alcoves painting by Correggio, and then the church of San Antonio. She also visited the library of Parma where she found ancient artifacts and sculptures. The Comte de Flavigny then introduced Vigée Le Brun to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s older sister, the bereaved Infanta and Duchess of Parma, Maria Amalia, while she was in mourning for her recently deceased brother Emperor Joseph II. The artist regarded her as lacking in Marie Antoinette&#x27;s beauty and grace, and being as pallid as a ghost, and criticized her way of life as being &quot;like that of a man&quot;, although she praised the warm welcome the Infanta had given her. Vigée Le Brun did not stay long in Parma, wishing to cross the mountains southwards before the seasons changed. De Flavigny postponed Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s departure from Parma by two days so that she and her daughter could be escorted by one of his trusted men, the Vicomte de Lespignière, whose carriage accompanied her all the way to Rome.

She first arrived in Modena, where she visited the local Palazzo, and saw several old master paintings by Raphael, Romano and Titian. She also visited the library and the theater there. From Modena, she departed for Bologna. The journey over the mountains was tortuous enough that she walked part of the way, and arrived in Bologna very tired. She wished to stay there at least one week to visit the local galleries and the Bologna arts school, which hosted some of the finest collections of old master paintings, but the innkeeper where she was residing had noticed her unloading her luggage, and informed her that her efforts were in vain, as French citizens were &quot;allowed to reside in that city for only one night&quot;. Vigée Le Brun despaired at this news, and was fearful when a man clad in black arrived at the inn whom she recognized as a papal messenger, and assumed he was delivering an order to leave within the next twenty-four hours, She was surprised and elated when she realized that the missive he carried was permission for her to stay in Bologna as long as she pleased. At this juncture, Vigée Le Brun became aware that the Papal government was informed of all French travelers who entered Italy.

She visited the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese, of which she wrote:
I went immediately to the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese, where this saint&#x27;s martyrdom is represented in a painting by Domenichino. The youth and innocence of Saint Agnes is so well captured on her beautiful face and the features of the torturer striking her with his sword form such a cruel contrast to her divine nature, that I was overwhelmed with pious admiration.

As I knelt before the masterpiece, someone played the overture to Iphigenia on the organ. The involuntary link that I made between the young pagan victim of that story and the young Christian victim, the memory of the peaceful, happy time when I had last listened to that piece of music, and the sad thought of all the evils pressing upon my unhappy country, weighed down my heart to the point where I began to cry bitterly and to pray to God on behalf of France. Fortunately, I was alone in the church and I was able to remain there for some time, giving vent to those painful emotions which took control of my soul.She then visited several Palazzi, where she viewed some of the finest examples of the Bologna art school. She also visited the Palazzo Caprara, the Palazzo Bonfigliola, and the Palazzo Sampierei, perusing arts and paintings by many old masters. Within three days of her arrival in Bologna, on 3 November 1789, she was received as a member of the academy and the institute of Bologna, with the academy director M. Bequetti personally delivering the letters of admission to her.

Soon after, she crossed the Apennines and arrived in the Tuscan countryside, and from there to Florence. The artist was initially disappointed with its position at the bottom of a wide valley, having preference for elevated views, but was soon charmed by the city&#x27;s beauty. She lodged herself in a hotel recommended to her.

While in Florence, she visited the famous Medici gallery, where she saw the widely-celebrated and famous Venus de&#x27; Medici and the room of the Niobids. She then visited the Pitti palace where she was enamored of several paintings by old masters, including Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna della Sedia&quot;, Titian&#x27;s portrait of Paul III, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Philosopher&quot;, Carracci&#x27;s &quot;The&quot; &quot;Holy Family&quot; and many others&quot;.&quot; She then visited the town&#x27;s most beautiful landmarks, including the Florence Baptistery, where she saw the Gates of Paradise by Lorenzo Ghiberti, the Church of San Lorenzo, and Michelangelo&#x27;s mausoleum at the Santa Croce. She also visited the Santissima Annunziata, where she entered the cloister and was enthralled by Andrea del Sarto&#x27;s &quot;Madonna del Sacco,&quot; comparing it to Raphael&#x27;s paintings, but also lamented the state of neglect of the lunettes. She also visited the Palazzo Altoviti, where she saw the self-portrait of Raphael, praising his countenance and expression as that of a &quot;man who was obviously a keen observer of life&quot;, but also stated that the painting&#x27;s protective glass had made its shadows darker. She then visited the Medici library, and later a gallery containing numerous self-portraits by famous artists, where she was asked to present her own self-portrait to the collection, promised to do so as soon as she reached Rome. During her stay in Florence, Vigée Le Brun made the acquaintance of another French lady, the Marquise de Venturi, who took her on excursions along the Arno. She soon left Florence and departed for Rome, arriving there in late November 1789.

As she arrived in Rome, she was surprised by how filthy the famous Tiber was. She headed to the French Academy in the Via del Corso where the director of the academy, M. de Ménageot, went down to receive her. She requested lodging of him, and he quickly furnished her, her daughter and her governess a nearby apartment. He took her to see Saint Peter&#x27;s on the very same day, where she was underwhelmed by its size; not matching the lavish descriptions she had heard of it, although its vastness became apparent to her upon walking around the structure. She stated to de Ménageot that she would have preferred for it to be supported by columns instead of enormous pillars, to which he replied that it was originally planned as such but it was found not feasible, later showing her some of the original plans for the Basilica.

She visited the Sistine Chapel later on to see Michelangelo&#x27;s much criticized &quot;The Last Judgement&quot;, for which she expressed great praise, writing in a letter to the painter Hubert Robert:
I also climbed the steps to the Sistine Chapel, to admire the ceiling with a fresco by Michelangelo as well as his painting of The Last Supper. Despite all the criticisms of this painting, I thought it a masterpiece of the first order for the expression and the boldness of the foreshortened figures. There is a sublime quality in both the composition and in the execution. As for the general air of chaos, I believe it to be totally justified by the subject matter: 
On the next day, she visited the Vatican museum; of her visit, she wrote to Robert:
The following day I went to the Vatican Museum. There is really nothing to compare with the classical masterpieces either in shape, style or execution. The Greeks, in particular, created a complete and perfect unison between truth and beauty. Looking at their work, there is no doubt that they possessed exceptional models, or that the men and women of Greece discovered an ideal of beauty long, long ago. As yet I have made only a superficial study of the museum&#x27;s contents, but the (Belvedere Apollo) &quot;Apollo&quot;, the &quot;Dying Gladiator&quot;, the &quot;Laocoon&quot;, the magnificent altars, the splendid candelabras, indeed all the beautiful things that I saw have left a permanent impression on my memory:
On the same day, she was summoned by the members of the Academy of Painting, including Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson: they presented her with the palette of the greatly talented deceased painter Jean Germain Drouais, In exchange, they asked her for her own palette, which she obliged. She later visited the Colosseum, where she saw the cross placed on one of its high points by Robert. While in Rome, she was very keen to seek out the famous female painter Angelica Kauffman, with whom she spent two evenings. Kauffmann showed Vigée Le Brun her gallery and sketches, and they engaged in long conversations. Vigée Le Brun praised her wit and intellect, although Vigée Le Brun found little inspirations in these evenings, citing Kaufmann&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm and Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s own dearth of knowledge. For the first three days of her stay in Rome, she visited the home of Cardinal François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis, who was a gracious host to her.

Vigée Le Brun was very sensitive to sound while sleeping; this was a lifetime burden for her, and when traveling to new locations or cities, frequent moving of lodgings was customary until she found a suitably quiet residence. Due to the racket of coachmen and horses near her apartment in the French Academy and the nightly music of the Calabrians to a nearby Madonna, she searched for other lodgings, which she found in the home of the painter Simon Denis in the Piazza di Spagna, but soon afterwards left this apartment due to the nightly habits of young men and women of singing in the streets at the night. She departed and found a third home, which she carefully scrutinized, then paid one month&#x27;s worth of rent in advance. On her first night there, she was awoken by a loud noise behind her bed caused by water being pumped through pipes to wash the laundry; a nightly occurrence. She quickly left this home as well to continue her search for quiet lodgings. After a painstaking search, she found a private mansion where she was told she might be able to rent an apartment. She lodged herself there but found it completely unsavory due to the filthiness of its rooms, its poor insulation and a rat infestation in the wooden paneling. Finding herself at her wit&#x27;s end, she was forced to stay there for six weeks before seeking a new home suitable to her needs. She eventually found a house which seemed perfect, but she refused to pay rent until she had spent a night there; she was immediately woken up by noise caused by a worm infestation in the joists of her room. She left this house as well, later writing: &quot;regretfully I had to abandon the idea of living there. No-one, I am sure, could have changed lodgings as often as I did during my various visits to the capital; I remain convinced that the most difficult thing to find in Rome is a place to live.&quot;

Soon after her arrival in Rome, she dispatched the promised self-portrait to Florence. In this portrait, she depicted herself in the act of painting, with the Queen&#x27;s face on her canvas. She made numerous copies of this portrait later on. The Rome Academy also requested her self-portrait, which she presented them with. She attended the pope&#x27;s blessing, delivered by Pope Pius IV during Easter Day in Saint Peter&#x27;s, while in Rome. Vigée Le Brun found his features stunning, describing them as &quot;not showing any signs of age&quot;.

She worked hard during her three-year residency in Rome, painting numerous subjects including Miss Pitt, Lord Bristol, , Emma, Lady Hamilton, Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland and many others. She toured Rome&#x27;s landmarks extensively, visiting the San Pietro in Vincoli, the San Lorenzo Fuori le Mura, the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, and the San Paolo la Fuori le Mura, which she found to be, architecturally, the most beautiful church in Rome. She also visited the Santa Maria della Vittoria, where she saw Bernini&#x27;s notorious &quot;Ecstasy of Saint Teresa,&quot; writing of it &quot;...whose scandalous expression defies description&quot;.

Apart from her fellow female artist Kaufmann, Vigée Le Brun found company in the Duchesse de Fleury, with whom she became close friends. She also found herself in the social circles of exiled French aristocracy who came to Rome, embedding herself there like most exiled French had done, instead of congregating with Italian aristocracy. She spent many evenings hosted by de Ménageot or the Prince Camille de Rohan, ambassador to Malta., who hosted many other exiled French aristocrats. Many of these she attended with her close friend the Duchesse de Fleury, on whom she greatly doted. She soon found one of her oldest friends, M. d&#x27;Agincourt, who had lent her art pieces from his gallery to copy when she was very young. She had last met him fourteen years previously in Paris, before he departed from there. She also met the Abbe Maury before he became Cardinal, who informed her that the pope wished her to paint his portrait. She was greatly flattered by the offer, but politely declined; fearing that she would fumble the portrait as she would be forced to wear a veil while painting the pope. Soon afterwards she was taken by de Ménageot, along with the painter Denis, for an excursion to Tivoli. There she visited the Temple of the Sibyl, and then Neptune&#x27;s Grotto. De Ménageot also took her to see the Villa Aldobrandini, and the ancient ruins of the Roman town of Tusculum, which &quot;evoked many sad thoughts&quot;. The entourage continued to Monte Cavo, seeking out the Temple of Jupiter built there. She visited numerous villas, including the Villa Conti, the Villa Palavicina and the ruins of Hadrian&#x27;s Villa. She also made frequent excursions to the summit of Monte Mario to enjoy the view it offered of the Apennines and visited the Villa Mellini there. In the summer months, she and the Duchesse de Fleury rented an apartment in the home of the painter Carlo Maratta in the Genazzano countryside. She and the Duchess toured the countryside there regularly, visiting Nemi and Albano among others. One of these excursions around Ariccia caused an incident in which she and the Duchess fled for their lives from what they suspected was a rogue following them, of which she wrote: &quot;I have never discovered whether the man who caused our exhaustion was a real villain or the most innocent man in the world&quot;.

After a residency of eight months in Rome, the painter planned to follow most of French polite society as it moved to Naples. She informed Cardinal Bernis, who approved of her decision to go, but told her to not travel alone; to that end, he referred her to M. Duvivier, the husband of Mme. Mignot, widow of the painter Denis and Voltaire&#x27;s niece. She traveled in his spacious carriage to Naples, stopping at an inn in Terracina on the way. As she arrived in Naples she was captivated by the view of the city, the distant plumes of smoke from Mount Vesuvius, the rolling hills of the countryside, and its citizens, writing &quot;...even the people, so lively, so boisterous, so different from the people of Rome, that one would think a thousand leagues lay between the two cities&quot;. Her first residency in Naples lasted for six months, although originally planned to be six weeks.

She initially lodged in Chiaia, in the Hotel de Maroc. Her neighbor, the ailing Count Scavronsky, Russian Minister Plenipotentiary to Naples, sent a missive to inquire of her shortly after her arrival, and sent her a lavish dinner. She visited him and his wife, Countess Catherine Skavronskaïa, the same night in their mansion, where she found amiable company with the couple, who invited her again on many evenings. The Count made Vigée Le Brun promise to paint his wife before anyone else in Naples, and she set to painting her portrait two days after her arrival. Soon afterwards, Sir William Hamilton, the English envoy extraordinary to the Kingdom of Naples, visited Vigée Le Brun while the Countess was sitting for her, requesting that the artist paint his mistress, Emma Hart, as her first portrait in the city, it being unknown to him that she had already promised Count Scavronsky that she would paint his wife. She later painted Emma Hart as a bacchante and was captivated by her beauty and long chestnut hair. Sir William also commissioned a portrait of himself, which she completed later. The artist noticed that Sir William had a mercantile inclination towards art, frequently selling paintings and portraits he commissioned for profit. On her future visit to England, she found that he had sold her portrait of him for 300 guineas. She also met Lord Bristol again and painted a second portrait of him. While in Naples, she also painted portraits of the Queen of Naples, Maria Carolina of Austria (sister of Marie Antoinette) and her four eldest living children: Maria Teresa, Francesco, Luisa and Maria Cristina. She later recalled that Luisa &quot;was extremely ugly, and pulled such faces that I was most reluctant to finish her portrait.&quot;

She visited the French ambassador to Naples, the Baron de Talleyrand, and while being hosted by him she met Mme. Silva, a Portuguese woman. Vigée Le Brun then decided to visit the island of Capri to see the palatial Roman ruins there. Her entourage included Mme Silva, the Comte de la Roche-Aymon [fr] and the young son of Baron de Talleyrand. The voyage to the island was turbulent due to rough waters. Soon afterwards, she made multiple trips to the summit of Vesuvius. Her entourage included Mme. Silva and Abbé Bertrand on the first journey, which was hampered by severe rain. On the next day, with clear weather, she climbed the volcano again, with M. de la Chesnaye joining. The party observed the erupting volcano, with plumes of smoke and ash rising from it.

Of her visit to Mount Vesuvius, she wrote in a letter to the architect Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart:
We also went up to the mountain refuge. The sun set and we watched its rays disappear behind the islands of Ischia and Procida: what a view! Eventually, night fell, and the smoke turned into flames, the most magnificent I have ever seen in my life. Great jets of fire shot up from the craters in quick succession, throwing red hot rocks noisily on all sides. At the same time a cascade of fire ran down front the summit, covering an area of four to five miles. Another lower mouth of the volcano was also alight; this crater churned out a red and gold smoke, rounding off the frightening but wonderful spectacle. The thunderous noise that seemed to come from deep inside the volcano echoed around us, and the ground shook beneath our feet. I was quite frightened, but tried to hide my fear for the sake of my poor little daughter who was crying, &quot;Maman, should I be afraid?&quot;. But there was so much to admire that I soon forgot my fear. Imagine looking down over countless furnaces, whole fields swallowed by the blaze that followed in the wake of the lava. I saw bushes, trees, vines, consumed by this terrible rolling fire; I saw the fire rise up and die out, and I heard it eat its way through the surrounding undergrowth. This powerful scene of destruction is both painful and impressive, and stirs deep feelings within one&#x27;s soul; I could not speak for a while on my return to Naples; on the road, I kept turning around to see the sparks and that river of fire once more. I was sad to leave such a spectacle; but I have the memory still, and every day I think on different aspects of what I saw. I have four drawings which I shall bring to Paris to show you. Two have already been mounted; we are very happy here.She returned to the volcano several times, visiting it with the painter Lethière, former director of the French Academy of Painting in Rome. Soon afterwards, she was invited by Sir William to visit the Islands of Ischia and Procida. This voyage included his mistress Emma Hart and her mother. Vigée Le Brun was instantly mesmerized by the island and its inhabitants, writing of its women &quot;I was instantly struck by the beauty of the women we encountered on the road. They were nearly all tall and statuesque, their costume as well as their build reminding me of the ancient women of Greece&quot;.

The party departed from Procida on the same way, bound for Ischia. They arrived there in the late evening. On the next day, they were taken by General Baron de Salis with a party of twenty to visit the summit of Monte San Nicola. The journey was perilous, and Vigée Le Brun was separated from the party due to dense fog, but soon afterwards found her way to the refuge at the summit of the mountain. After returning to Naples, the artist visited the ancient ruins of Paestum, Herculaneum, Pompeii and the museum at Portici. Shortly before the new year, she moved to another home due to problems with her previous residence. It was there that she also met the famous composer Giovanni Paisiello and painted his portrait while he was in the process of composition. She frequented Mount Posillipo during her stay in Naples, including the ancient ruins there and Virgil&#x27;s grave, and it became one of her favorite landmarks.

She returned to Rome afterwards, just in time to find the Queen of Naples arriving from her visit to Austria. The Queen espied the artist in a large crowd, went to her and impressed her to return to Naples to paint her portrait; Le Brun agreed to the prospect. Upon her return to Naples, she was taken by Sir William to the widely popular local festival of Madonna di Piedigrotta, the festival of Madonna dell&#x27;Arco. She also visited the Solfatara volcano with M. Amaury Duval and Sacaut. While in Naples, the artist was also fascinated by the local culture of the Lazzaroni.

Upon finishing her portrait of the Queen, she was offered her summerhouse near the coast to entice her to spend more time in Naples, but Le Brun insisted on leaving. Before departing, the Queen gave her a luxurious lacquered box containing her monogram surrounded by fine gems. She returned to Rome once again, undertaking many commissions there, including those of Louis XVI&#x27;s aunts, mesdames Victoire and Adélaïde. She left Rome on 14 April 1792 for Venice, writing later that she wept bitterly as she left Rome, having grown very attached to that city. She was accompanied by M. Auguste Rivière, occasional diplomat and painter and the brother of Le Brun&#x27;s sister-in-law. He would be the artist&#x27;s travelling companion for 9 years, often copying her portraits. Le Brun spent the first night on the road at Civita Castellana, then continued her journey through precipitous and craggy roads, describing the landscape there as gloomy and &#x27;the saddest in the world&#x27;. She then arrived in Narni, where she was charmed by the countryside. From there she continued on to Terni where she toured the countryside and hiked up local mountains. She resumed her journey over Monte Somma across the Apennines then to Spoleto. In this town, she witnessed Raphael&#x27;s partially completed Adoration of the Magi, from which she gained valuable information on his painting techniques, observing that he painted hands and faces first, and experimented frequently with different tints during the early drafting process. While in Spoleto she also visited the Temple of Concord in the mountains, and the ruins of the ancient town there. She continued to Venice, passing Trevi, Cetri and Foligno. In the latter town she found Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna di Foligno,&quot; which gained the complete admiration of Le Brun. She continued to Perugia, passing by Lake Trasimene and hen on to Lise, Combuccia, Arezzo, Levana and Pietre-Fonte, finally arriving in Florence, where she had resided for a short while after her flight from France.

Upon her arrival in Florence, she had a memorable meeting with the Abbé Felice Fontana, then a renowned anatomist. Fontana showed Le Brun his study, filled with wax figures of human organs. The intricacy of the details on some of the replicas had made the artist feel that only divine power could have created the human body. Fontana then showed Le Brun a life-sized figure of a human female, with an exposed cutaway of the intestines. Vigée Le Brun was nearly sick at this sight, and was haunted by it for a long time, later writing to Fontana for advice on relieving herself from the stress and consequences of having seen the internal anatomy of the human body, to which he replied to her; &quot;That which you describe as a weakness and a misfortune, is in fact the source of your strength and talent; moreover, if you wish to diminish the inconvenience caused by this sensitivity, then stop painting&quot;.

After departing Florence she travelled to Siena where she remained for a few days, excursing frequently in its countryside and visiting local churches and galleries. From Siena she left for Parma, where she was welcomed as a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma, and donated a portrait of her daughter. During her stay there, she was visited by a small group of art students from the academy who wished to acquaint themselves with her work:
I was told that there were seven or eight art students downstairs who wished to see me. They were ushered into the room where I had placed my &quot;Sibyl&quot; and a few minutes later I went to receive them. Having spoken of their desire to meet me, they continued by saying that they would very much like to see one of my paintings. &quot;Here is one I have recently completed&quot;, I replied, pointing to the &quot;Sibyl&quot;. At first their surprise held them silent: I considered this far more flattering than the most fulsome praise: several then said that they had thought the painting the work of one of the masters of their school: one actually threw himself at my feet, his eyes full of tears. I was even more moved, even more delighted with their admiration since the &quot;Sibyl&quot; had always been one of my favourite works.
After a few days in Parma, during which she revisited numerous churches and local landmarks &amp; galleries, she finally departed Parma in July 1792, visiting Mantua on her way to Venice. In Mantua she visited the local Cathedral, the ducal palace, the house of Giulio Romano, the Church of Sant&#x27;Andrea, the Palazzo del Te and numerous other local landmarks.

She arrived in Venice on the eve of Ascension day. She was surprised by the city&#x27;s partially submerged aspect, and it was some time before she became accustomed to the modes of transportation in the city&#x27;s canals. She was received by M. Denon, a fellow artist whom she knew from Paris, who acted as her cicerone, touring the city&#x27;s landmarks with her. She subsequently witnessed the marriage of Venice and the Sea ceremony. During the celebrations, she met the Prince Augustus of England, and the Princess de Monaco, whom she found to have been pining to return to France to see her children; this was to be her last meeting with the princess, who had been later executed during Reign of Terror.

While in Venice, she visited the churches of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the Church of Saint Mark and the Piazza San Marco, and the local cemetery. While residing in Venice, she often engaged the company of the Spanish ambassadress, with whom she attended Gaspare Pacchierotti last concert. She soon departed Venice for Milan, stopping at Vicenza, touring its palaces and landmarks, where she was also received lavishly. She then visited Padua, where she visited Church of the Eremitani, praising the church&#x27;s frescos that were made by Andrea Mantegna, and also visited the Basilica del Santo and the church of Saint John the Baptist. After departing Padua, she visited Verona, where she spent a week, touring the ruins of the Amphitheatre, the San Giorgio in Braida, the Church of Sant&#x27;Anastasia and the Church of San Zeno. After spending a week in Verona she left the city, hoping to return to France by way of Turin.

In Turin she referred herself to the Queen of Sardinia, having been given letters of introduction by her aunts, the Mesdames of France whom she had painted in Rome; requesting the artist to paint their niece on her way to France. When she presented this to the bereaved Queen, she politely refused the request, stating that she has given up all worldly matters and had taken up an austere life, which the painter had confirmed from the Queen&#x27;s disheveled appearance. She also made acquaintance of her husband, the King of Sardinia, while visiting the Queen, finding that had become increasingly reclusive and very thin, and delegated most of his duties to the Queen.

After meeting the Queen of Sardinia, Le Brun visited Madame, the wife of the Comte de Provence, future king Louis XVIII (future queen of France in-exile). She excursed frequently to the countryside with her and her lady in waiting, Marguerite de Gourbillon. She soon met the engraver Porporati again, who recommended her to lodge in a quiet inn in the countryside, she travelled there and was greatly pleased by the quietude and charming views it offered. not long afterwards Vigée Le Brun received news of the storming of the Tuileries of 10 August. Beset with despair, she set back for Turin, where she found the town filled with French refugees as turmoil intensified during the French Revolution, setting a cruel spectacle for the artist. She subsequently rented a small home on the Moncalieri hillside, overlooking the Po river with M. de Rivière, who had arrived recently and narrowly escaped revolutionary violence as it swept the countryside, in solitude. Soon after she was frequently visited there by the Prince Nikolay Yusupov. She soon decided to leave for Milan, but not before repaying the kindness Porporati had extended to her by painting his daughter&#x27;s portrait, with which he was greatly pleased and made several engravings of the painting, sending several of them to Le Brun.

During her stay in Venice she lost yet another fortune, amounting to 35,000 francs, most of which she had accumulated from her commissions in Italy - which she had deposited in the bank of Venice, when French troops, campaigning under the command of the rising general Napoleon Buonaparte, captured the city shortly after she had left it. Le Brun had been repeatedly warned by M. Sacaut, the embassy secretary, to withdraw her money from the bank, foreseeing that French Republican troops might attack the city. The artist dismissed his warnings as &quot;a republic would never attack another republic&quot;; nevertheless Napoleon later issued an ultimatum to the city to submit, and French troops entered the city. As Venice was looted, General Buonaparte had instructed the banker to spare Le Brun&#x27;s deposit and afford her an annuity, but the orders were not carried out in the chaotic predicament of the city, and all that reached Vigée Le Brun were two hundred and fifty francs out of an original deposit of 40,000. During her travels in Italy, her name was added to the list of émigrés, losing her French citizenship and having her property scheduled for confiscation. M. Le Brun attempted to have his wife&#x27;s name struck from the list of émigrés at this juncture by appealing to the Assemblée législative to no avail, and he along with Étienne, Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s brother, were both briefly incarcerated in 1793, shortly before the terror began. Soon after, M. Le Brun attempted to protect himself and their properties from confiscation and began suing for divorce from his wife. The decree of divorce was issued on 3 June 1793.

Halfway through her journey to Milan, she was detained for two days due to her nationality. She sent a letter to Count Wilsheck, the Austrian ambassador in the town, who secured her release. The count convinced Vigée Le Brun to travel to Vienna, and she decided to go there after her visit to Milan. The artist received a warm welcome in Milan, with many young men and women from noble families serenading her outside her window, which persuaded the artist to extend her stay in Milan by a few days. It was during this time that she visited the Santa Maria delle Grazie and saw Leonardo Da Vinci&#x27;s famous &quot;Last Supper.&quot; Writing of it:
I visited the refectory of the monastery known as Santa Maria delle Grazie with its famous Last Supper fresco by Leonardo da Vinci. It is one of the great masterpieces of the Italian school: yet in admiring this nobly portrayed Christ and all the other characters painted with such truth and such feeling, I groaned to see the extent to which this superb painting had been defaced: to begin with it had been covered with plaster, and then repainted in several parts. Nevertheless it was possible to judge what this beautiful work had been like prior to these disasters. for the effect, when viewed from a little distance, was still admirable. Since then I have learnt of a completely different cause of its poor condition. I was told that during the wars with Bonaparte in Italy, the soldiers would amuse themselves by firing musket balls at Leonardo&#x27;s Last Supper! May these Barbarians be cursed!
 She also saw various cartoons of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;School of Athens&quot;, and various other drawings and sketches by Raphael, Da Vinci and numerous other artists at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. She visited the Madonna del Monte, enjoying its commanding view, and sketched the countryside frequently.

She later visited Lake Maggiore and resided on one of the two islands in the lake, the Isola Bella, being granted permission by the Prince Borromeo to lodge on the estate there. She soon attempted to visit the other isle, Isola Madre, but stormy weather affected her journey and she returned. It was during this period that she met the Countess Bistri, who would become one of her close friends. She informed the countess of her desire to travel to Vienna, and the countess replied that she and her husband were travelling there soon. Wishing to accompany the artist on her travel, the count and countess brought forward their date of departure to accomplish this. Vigée Le Brun praised the great care they took of her, and she finally left Milan for Austria. Vigée Le Brun would later describe Milan as being very similar to Paris.

While in Italy, Vigée Le Brun was elected to the Academy in Parma (1789) and the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (1790). Vigée Le Brun also painted allegorical portraits of Emma Hamilton as Ariadne (1790) and as a Bacchante (1792). Lady Hamilton was similarly the model for Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s &quot;Sibyl&quot; (1792), which was inspired by the painted sibyls of Domenichino. The painting represents the Cumaean Sibyl, as indicated by the Greek inscription on the figure&#x27;s scroll, which is taken from Virgil&#x27;s fourth Eclogue. The &quot;Sibyl&quot; was Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s favorite work; it is mentioned in her memoir more than any other work. She displayed it while in Venice (1792), Vienna (1792), Dresden (1794) and Saint Petersburg (1795); she also sent it to be shown at the Salon of 1798. It was perhaps her most successful painting and had always garnered the most praise and attracted many viewers wherever it was displayed. Like her reception piece, &quot;Peace Bringing Back Abundance&quot;, Vigée Le Brun regarded her &quot;Sibyl&quot; as a history painting, the most elevated category in the Académie&#x27;s hierarchy.

==== Austria ====
As well as the Countess Bistri and her husband she travelled to Vienna with two other French refugees of poorer origin whom they had taken on. The artist found their company priceless and lodged herself with them in Vienna, with some difficulty in procuring residence due to the travelling party&#x27;s composition. This would be the beginning of two and a half years of her residency in Austria. Upon lodging herself there, she finished her painting of the countess Bistri, praising her as a &quot;truly beautiful woman&quot;, then she presented herself to the Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein, armed with letters of introduction given to her by Count Wilsheck. The artist found a large number of elegant ladies in the countess&#x27; salon, and while there, met the Countess Kinska, of whom Vigée Le Brun was completely enraptured with her beauty. Vigée Le Brun proceeded to tour the city&#x27;s galleries as was her custom when visiting new cities. She first paid a visit to the gallery of the famous painter of battles, Francesco Giuseppe Casanova. She found him in the middle of undertaking several paintings, and found him to be quite active despite being about sixty and &quot;having the habit of wearing two or three spectacles, atop one another&quot;, and commented on his &quot;unusual and sharp mind&quot; and his rich imagination when retelling stories or recounting past events during the dinners they had spent with the Prince Kaunitz. Vigée Le Brun praised his composition, though commented that numerous of his works that she witnessed were still not finished.

After meeting Casanova, she presented herself to the aging Prince Kaunitz, at his palace. She found dinners hosted by the prince to be uncomfortable due to the late time in which he dined and the large number of people often present at his table and subsequently decided to dine at home most days. On days when she would accept his invitations, she would dine at home before leaving and ate very little at his table. The prince noticed this and was offended by this and her frequent refusal of his invitations, leading to a short quarrel between the two, but they were soon reconciled. The Prince continued to host the artist and exhibited her &quot;Sibyl&quot; in his gallery, and she praised the kindness and sweetness he had extended her during her stay. When the Prince died shortly after, Vigée Le Brun was upset by the indifference the city&#x27;s residents and aristocracy showed, and was further shocked when she visited the wax museum and found the Prince lying in state, his hair and clothes dressed exactly as they had always been. This sight had made a sorrowful impression on her.

While in Vienna, Vigée Le Brun was commissioned to paint Princess Maria Josepha Hermengilde Esterházy as Ariadne and Princess Karoline von Liechtenstein as Iris among many others, the latter portrait causing a minor scandal among the Princess&#x27;s relatives. The portraits depict the Liechtenstein sisters-in-law in unornamented Roman-inspired garments that show the influence of Neoclassicism, and which may have been a reference to the virtuous republican Roman matron Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi. The artist met for the second time in Vienna one of her greatest friends, the Prince de Ligne, whom she had first met in Brussels in 1781. It was at his urging that Vigée Le Brun wished so much to meet the Russian sovereign Catherine the Great and to visit Russia. The Prince de Ligne urged her to stay at his former convent atop Kahlenberg, with its commanding view of the countryside, to which she agreed. During Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s stay in Kahlenberg, de Ligne wrote a passionate poem about her. After two and half years in Vienna, the artist departed for Saint Petersburg on 19 April 1795, via Prague. She also visited Dresden on her way, and the Königsberg fortress, where she made the acquaintance of Prince Henry of Prussia, who was very hospitable to the artist. While visiting Dresden on her way to Russia, Vigée Le Brun visited the famous Dresden gallery, writing that it was without doubt the most extensive one in all of Europe. It was there that she saw Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna di San Sisto.&quot; She was completely enamored of the painting, and wrote:
==== Russia ====

In Russia, where she stayed from 1795 until 1801, she was well-received by the nobility and painted numerous aristocrats, including the former King of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski, whom she became well acquainted with, and other members of the family of Catherine the Great. Vigée Le Brun painted Catherine&#x27;s granddaughters (daughters of Paul I of Russia), Elena and Alexandra Pavlovna, in Grecian tunics with exposed arms. The Empress&#x27;s favorite, Platon Zubov, commented to Vigée Le Brun that the painting had scandalized the Empress due to the amount of bare skin the short sleeves revealed. Vigée Le Brun was greatly worried by this and considered it a hurtful remark and replaced the tunics with the muslin dresses the princesses wore, and added long sleeves (called Amadis in Russia). Vigée Le Brun was later reassured in a conversation with Catherine that she made no such remark, but by then the damage had already been done. When Paul later became Emperor, he expressed having been upset with the alterations Vigée Le Brun made to the painting. When Vigée Le Brun told him what Zubov told her, he shrugged and said &quot;They played a joke on you&quot;. Vigée Le Brun painted many other people during her stay in Russia, including the emperor Paul and his consort.

Catherine herself also agreed to sit for Vigée Le Brun, but she died the very next day, which was when she had promised to sit for the artist. While in Russia, Vigée Le Brun was made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg. Much to her dismay, her daughter Julie married Gaétan Bernard Nigris, secretary to the Director of the Imperial Theaters of Saint Petersburg. Vigée Le Brun attempted everything in her power to prevent this match, and viewed it as a scheme concocted by her enemies and her governess to separate her from her daughter. However, as Julie&#x27;s remonstrations and pressure on her mother grew, Vigée Le Brun relented and gave her approval for the wedding, though she was greatly distressed at the prospect, and soon found her stay in Russia, hitherto so enjoyable, had become suffocating and decided to return to Paris. She wrote:
Before departing for France, Vigée Le Brun decided to visit Moscow. Halfway through her journey to the city, news of the assassination of Paul I reached her. The journey was extremely difficult due to the melting snow, and the carriage often got stuck in the infamous Russian mud, and her journey was further delayed when most horses were taken by couriers spreading the news of the death of Paul and the coronation of Alexander. Vigée Le Brun enjoyed her stay in Moscow, and painted many portraits during her stay. Upon her return to Saint Petersburg, she met the newly crowned Emperor Alexander I and Empress Louise, who urged her to stay in Saint Petersburg. Upon telling the Emperor of her poor health and prescription by a physician to take the waters near Karlsbad to cure her internal obstruction, the Emperor replied &quot;Do not go there, there is no need to go so far to find a remedy; I shall give you the Empress&#x27;s horse, a few rides will have you cured&quot;. Vigée Le Brun was touched by this, but replied to the Emperor that she did not know how to ride, to which the Emperor said &quot;Well, I will give you a riding instructor, he will teach you&quot;. The artist was still adamant about leaving Russia, despite her closest friends, the Count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov, M. de Rivière and the princesses Dolgoruky and Kourakina and others attempting all they could to make her stay in Saint Petersburg, she left after residing there for six years. Julie predeceased her mother in 1819, by which time they had reconciled.

It was in Russia that Vigée Le Brun formed several of her longest lasting and most intimate friendships, with the Princesses Dolgoruky and Kourakin, and the Count Stroganov.

==== Prussia ====

After her departure from Saint Petersburg, Vigée Le Brun travelled – with some difficulty – through Prussia, visiting Berlin after an exhausting journey. The Queen of Prussia invited Vigée Le Brun to Potsdam to meet her; the Queen then commissioned a portrait of herself. The Queen invited the artist to reside in the Potsdam palace until she finished her portrait, but Vigée Le Brun, not wishing to intrude on the Queen&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, chose to reside in a nearby hotel, where her stay was uncomfortable.

The pair soon became friends. During a conversation, Vigée Le Brun complemented the Queen on her bracelets with an antique design, which the Queen then took off and put around Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s arms. Vigée Le Brun considered this gift one of her most valued possessions for the rest of her life and wore it almost everywhere. At the Queen&#x27;s urging, Vigée Le Brun visited the Queen&#x27;s Peacock Island, where the artist enjoyed the countryside.

Aside from two pastel portraits commissioned by the Queen, Vigée Le Brun also painted other pastel portraits of Prince Ferdinand&#x27;s family.

During her stay in Berlin, she met with the General Plenipotentiary Bournonville, hoping to procure a passport to return to France. The general encouraged Vigée Le Brun to return and assured her that order and safety had been restored. Her brother and husband had already struck her name from the list of émigrés with ease and had her French status restored. Shortly before her departure from Berlin, the General Director of the Academy of Painting visited her, bringing her the diploma for her admission to that academy. After her departure from Berlin, she visited Dresden and painted several copies of Emperor Alexander, which she had promised earlier, and also visited Brunswick where she resided for six days with the Rivière family, and was sought out by the Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick who wished to make her acquaintance. She also passed through Weimar and Frankfurt on her way.

==== Return to France and stay at Paris ====
After a sustained campaign by her ex-husband and other family members to have her name removed from the list of counter-revolutionary émigrés, Vigée Le Brun was finally able to return to France in January 1802. The artist received a rapturous welcome in her home at Rue de-Gros-Chenet and was greatly hailed by the press. Three days after her arrival, a letter arrived for her from the Comédie-Française, containing a decree reinstating her as a member of the theater. The leading members of the theater also wished to enact a comedy at her house to celebrate her return, which she politely refused. Soon afterwards, the artist was taken to witness the first consul&#x27;s routine military ceremony at the Tuileries where she saw Napoleon Bonaparte for the first time, from a window inside the Louvre. The artist found it difficult to recognize the short figure as the man she had heard so much about; as with Catherine the Great, she had imagined a tall figure. A few days later, Bonaparte&#x27;s brothers visited her gallery to view her works, with Lucien Bonaparte greatly complimenting her famous &quot;Sibyl&quot;. During her stay, Vigée Le Brun was surprised and dismayed by the greatly changed social customs of Parisian society upon her return there. She soon visited the famous painter Joseph-Marie Vien, who was the former &quot;Premier peintre du Roi&quot;; then 82 years old and a senator, he gave Vigée Le Brun an enthusiastic welcome and showed her some of his newest sketches. She met her friend from Saint Petersburg, Princess Dolgorouky, and saw her almost daily. In 1802, she demanded the refund of her dowry from her husband, whose gambling habits had dissipated a significant portion of the wealth she had accumulated in her early career as a portraitist. The artist soon felt mentally tormented in Paris, mainly due to memories of the early days of the Revolution, and decided to move to a secluded house in Meudon forest. She was visited there by her neighbors, the famous dissident pair and Directory period &quot;Merveilleuses&quot; the Duchesse de Fleury, whom she met there for the first time since their friendship in Rome, and Adèle de Bellegarde; time spent with the pair restored her spirits. Shortly thereafter, Vigée Le Brun decided to travel to England, and departed from Paris on 15 April 1802.

==== England ====

Vigée Le Brun arrived at Dover, where she took the stagecoach to London, accompanied by the woman who would become her lifetime friend and chambermaid, Mme Adélaïde, who later married M. Contat, Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s accountant. Vigée Le Brun was confused by the large crowd at the quays but was reassured that it was common for crowds of curious people to observe disembarking travelers in England. She had been told that highwaymen were common in England, and so hid her diamonds in her stocking. During her ride to London, she was greatly frightened by two riders who approached the stagecoach whom she thought were bandits, but nothing came of it.

Upon her arrival at London, she lodged at the Brunet hotel in Leicester Square. She could not sleep during her first night due to noise from her upstairs neighbor, who she found next morning was none other than the poet François-Auguste Parseval-Grandmaison, whom she had known from Paris. He always paced while reading or reciting his poetry. He promised her to take care not to interrupt her sleep, and she was able to rest well for the next night.

Wishing to find a more permanent lodging, a compatriot named Charmilly directed her to a house in Beck Street, which overlooked the Royal Guards barracks. Vigée Le Brun terminated her residence there because of the noise from the barracks; in her words, &quot;...every morning between three and four o&#x27;clock there was a trumpet blast so loud that it could have served for the day of judgement. The noise of the trumpet, together with that of the horses whose stables lay directly beneath my window, prevented me from catching any sleep at all. In the daytime there was a constant din made by the neighbor&#x27;s children...&quot;. Vigée Le Brun then moved to a beautiful house in Portman Square. Upon closely scrutinizing the house&#x27;s surroundings for any acoustic nuisance, she took up lodging there, only to be awakened at daybreak by a great screeching from a large bird owned by her neighbor. Later on, she also discovered that the former residents had buried two of their slaves in the cellar, where their bodies remained, and once again she decided to move, this time to a very damp building in Maddox Street. Although this was far from perfect, the artist was exhausted from constant moving, and decided to remain there, though the dampness of the house, combined with London&#x27;s humid weather – greatly disliked by the artist – hindered her painting process. Vigée Le Brun found London lacking in inspiration for an artist due to its lack of public galleries at that time. She visited monuments, including Westminster Abbey, where she was greatly affected by the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots, and visited the sarcophagi of the poets William Shakespeare, Thomas Chatterton and Alexander Pope. She also visited St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the Tower of London and the London Museum. She greatly disliked the austere social customs of the English, particularly how quiet and empty the city was on Sundays, when all shops were closed and no social gatherings took place; the only pastime was the city&#x27;s long walks. The artist also did not enjoy the local soiree equivalent – known as Routs (or rout-parties), describing them as stuffy and dour. The artist sought out the tree under which the famous poet John Milton was said to have composed &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, but was surprised to find that it had been cut down.

The artist visited the galleries of several prominent artists while in London, starting with the studio of artist Benjamin West. She also viewed some works by Joshua Reynolds. Vigée Le Brun was surprised to find that it was customary in England for visitors to the studios of artists to pay a small fee to the artist. Vigée Le Brun did not adhere to this local custom, and allowed her servant to pocket this toll. She was greatly pleased to meet one of the most famous actress and tragediennes of her era, Sarah Siddons, who visited Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s studio in Maddox Street. During her stay in London, the English portraitist John Hoppner published a speech that viciously criticized her, her art and French artists in general, to which she made a scathing reply by letter which she published later in her life as part of her memoirs.

Vigée Le Brun continued to hold soirées and receptions in her house, which although damp, was beautiful. She received many people, including the Prince of Wales George IV, Lady Hertford and Lord Borington and the famous actress Giuseppina Grassini among others. Vigée Le Brun sought out other compatriots during her stay in England, and cultivated a social circle of émigrés that included the Comte d&#x27;Artois (future King Charles X) and his son Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, the Duc de Serant and the Duc de Rivière.

Shortly after her arrival in London, the Treaty of Amiens was abrogated, and hostilities between France and the United Kingdom resumed. The British Government ordered all French people who had not resided more than a year in the UK to depart immediately. The Prince of Wales reassured Vigée Le Brun that this would not affect her, and she might reside in England however long she pleased. This permit from the King was difficult to procure, but the Prince of Wales personally delivered the permit to Vigée Le Brun.

Vigée Le Brun toured the countryside during her stay in England. She started with a visit to Margaret Chinnery at Gilwell Hall, where she received a &quot;charming welcome&quot; and met the famous musician Giovanni Battista Viotti, who composed a song for her which was sung by Mrs. Chinnery&#x27;s daughter. She painted Mrs. Chinnery and her children whilst there, departing for Windsor after staying at Gilwell for a fortnight. She also visited Windsor Park and Hampton Court on the outskirts of London before leaving to visit Bath, where she greatly enjoyed the picturesque architecture of the city, its rolling hills and the countryside; but much like London, she found its society and weather dreary. She found some of her Russian friends from Saint Petersburg there, and went to visit the astronomer siblings William Herschel and Caroline Herschel. William Herschel showed Vigée Le Brun detailed maps of the moon, among other things.

The artist greatly enjoyed the English countryside, describing Matlock as being as picturesque as the Swiss countryside. Vigée Le Brun also visited the Duchess of Dorset at Knole House in Kent, which had once been owned by Elizabeth I. She returned to London, where she found Joseph Hyacinthe François de Paule de Rigaud, Comte de Vaudreuil, and then went to Twickenham where she visited Mme la Comtesse de Vaudreuil and Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier, with whom Vigée Le Brun became well acquainted; they enjoyed painting the countryside together. She was subsequently received by the Duc d&#x27;Orléans (the future King Louis Philippe I). She then visited the Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the Baroness Craven, whom she painted and came to greatly enjoy her company, spending three weeks at her estate. Together, they visited the Isle of Wight, where Vigée Le Brun was mesmerized by the beauty of the countryside and the amiability of its inhabitants, writing later that along with the Isle of Ischia (near Naples), these were the only two places where she would happily spend her entire life.

She visited Mary Elizabeth Grenville, Marchioness of Buckingham, at Stowe. She also went to the home of Lord Moira and his sister Charlotte Adelaide Constantia Rawdon, where Vigée Le Brun further experienced the stern social milieu of English aristocracy; she spent some of the winter there. She then departed for Warwick Castle, eager to see this after hearing it praised so much. Vigée Le Brun attempted to visit the area incognito to avoid any awkwardness with Lord Warwick, as he would receive foreigners only if he knew their name. When he became aware that Vigée Le Brun was visiting, he went to her in person and gave her a decorous reception. After introducing the artist to his wife, he took her on a tour around the castle, looking over the lavish art collection there. He presented her with two drawings which she had sketched in Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s summerhouse during her stay in Italy, telling her that he had paid a high price to buy them from his nephew. Vigée Le Brun later wrote that she had never sold them to Sir William to begin with. He also presented to her the famous Warwick vase, which he had purchased from Sir William as well. Vigée Le Brun then ended her tour by visiting Blenheim Palace before returning to London, and preparing to depart for France after staying in England for nearly three years. Upon her imminent departure becoming known, many of her acquaintances attempted to extend her residence with them, but to no avail as Vigée Le Brun wanted to see her daughter, who was in Paris at the time. As she prepared to leave London, Mme Grassini arrived and then accompanied her, staying with her until her ship departed for Rotterdam, ending a trip that was originally intended to last only five months.

==== Return to France from England ====
Her ship arrived in Rotterdam, where she first visited François de Beauharnais, the prefect of Rotterdam and brother in law to the Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais (brother to the late Alexandre de Beauharnais, who had been executed during The Terror). The artist was ordered to reside for eight to ten days in Rotterdam, as she has arrived from hostile soil, and was ordered to appear before the General Charles Oudinot, who was hospitable to her. After residing in Rotterdam for ten days, she received her passport and started for Paris. She visited Antwerp on her way to Paris and was received by its prefect, the Comte d&#x27;Hédouville [fr], and toured the city with him and his wife, and visited a sick young painter who wished to make her acquaintance.

She arrived in Paris and rejoiced to find her brother and her husband there, who was charged with recruiting artists for Saint Petersburg. He departed a few months later for Saint Petersburg, but Julie remained due to their failing union, though her relationship with her daughter continued to be a torment to her. She made the acquaintance of one of the most famous singers of her time, Angelica Catalani. She painted her and kept her portrait along with that of Mme Grassini for the rest of her life, and continued to host soirées in her home as she had always had, to which Mme. Catalani was a regular.

Shortly after her arrival in Paris, Vigée Le Brun was commissioned by the court painter, Vivant Denon, to paint a portrait of the Emperor&#x27;s sister Caroline Bonaparte, though she had heard that her journey to England had displeased Napoleon, who had allegedly said &quot;Madame Le Brun has gone to England to see her &quot;friends&quot;&quot;. Vigée Le Brun accepted the commission despite the fact that she was paid 1800 Francs, less than half the customary asking price, and later also included Mme Murat&#x27;s daughter in the portrait without raising the fee. She later described this commission as &quot;torture&quot;, and wrote in her memoirs:
It would be impossible to describe all the vexations and torment I had to suffer while painting this portrait. First of all Mme Murat arrived with two ladies in waiting who proceeded to dress her hair as I tried to paint her. When I observed that it would be impossible to capture a likeness if I allowed them to continue, she eventually agreed to send the two women away. Added to this inconvenience, she almost always broke our appointments, which meant my staying in Paris for the whole summer waiting, usually in vain, for her to appear, for I was eager to finish the painting; I cannot tell you how this woman tried my patience. Moreover the gap between sittings was so long, that each time she did appear, her hair was dressed differently. At the beginning, for example, she had curls falling onto her cheek and I painted them accordingly; but a little later this style had gone out of fashion and she returned with a completely different one; I then had to rub out the curls as well as the pearls on her bandeau and replace them with cameos. The same thing happened with the dresses. The first dress I painted was rather open, as was the fashion then, and had a great deal of bold embroidery; when the fashion changed and the embroidery became more delicate, I had to enlarge the dress in order not to lose the detail. Eventually all these irritations reached a pitch, and I became very bad tempered as a result; one day she happened to be in my studio and I said to M. Denon, in a voice loud enough for her to overhear: &#x27;When I painted real princesses they never gave me any trouble and never kept me waiting.&#x27; Of course Mme Murat did not know that punctuality is the politeness of kings, as Louis XIV quite rightly remarked and he, at least, was no upstart.The portrait was exhibited in the Salon of 1807, and was the only portrait the imperial government commissioned from her.

==== Switzerland in 1807 ====
In July 1807, the artist crossed to Switzerland, arriving first at the town of Basel, where she was received by Christoph Ehinger, a local banker, who threw a banquet to welcome the artist. She proceeded to Biel on the advice of Ehinger, but the roads there were so hazardous that part of the journey had to be made on foot. After recuperating in Biel for a single day, she proceeded to the tiny Île Saint-Pierre to visit the home of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which she found, to her great surprise and dismay, had become a tavern. Vigée Le Brun praised the picturesque countryside repeatedly in her letters to Countess Vincent Potocka. After departing the island to return to Biel, she went on to Bern, where she was received by the wife of the &quot;Landamann&quot; (magistrate), Mme de Watteville, and the General Ambassador Honoré Vial. She also met the seven-months pregnant Mme de Brac, who accompanied her to Thun, and then to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, which she found dark and grim due to its being hidden from sunlight on both sides by steep mountains. On her descent, she and her company encountered a group of local shepherdesses; the beauty and naivete of the local people and the wilderness where the encounter took place made her liken the experience to something out of &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. She went on to visit the Staubbach Falls in the valley.

After traversing the rugged trails of the valley, she returned to Bern via Brientz, and then arrived at Schaffhausen where she was received by the local Burgomeister, who took her to see the Rhine Falls. After departing from Schaffhausen, she visited the city of Zürich, where she enjoyed the hospitality of General Baron de Salis.

After taking the young daughter-in-law of de Salis with her, she departed for the small island of Ufenau in Lake Zurich, then visited Rappercheld where she continued to be mesmerized by the beauty of the countryside and the &quot;native innocence&quot; of the locals. After a hazardous boat ride destined for Walenstadt, the entourage turned back to Rappercheld and then visited the valley of Glarus. The artist then continued to the village of Soleure, on the Jura mountains. Seeing a solitary chalet perched atop Mount Wunchenstein , her curiosity was excited by who would live so far and high, and she made a trek up the mountain after being assured that the conditions of the road would support her carriage. After slightly less than an hour, the road became very rugged and far too steep, prompting her to dismount and continue the journey on foot. The trek lasted about five and a half hours, though she wrote in a letter to Countess Potocka that the view made it completely worth it:
to tell the truth, the view completely eliminated my fatigue. Five or six vast forests, piled one upon the other, fell away beneath my eyes; the canton of Soleure seemed no more than a plain, the town and the villages, tiny specks; the fine line of glaciers which fringed the horizon became redder and redder as the sun sank: the other mountains between them formed a complete color spectrum; gold rays stretched across the mountain to my left, each carrying a rainbow in its arc; the sun set behind the peak; red-violet mountains grew imperceptibly fainter and fainter in the distance, stretching away to the lake of Biel and the far edge of Lake Neuchatel, they stood so far apart that you could only distinguish them by two gold lines. heavy with translucent mist; I was still overlooking the deep ravines and mountains covered with thick foliage; at my feet lay wild valleys surrounded by black pine forests. As the sun set, I watched the shadows change; different points took on a more sinister character, partly because of their shape and partly because of that long silence which slips harmoniously into the day&#x27;s demise. All I can tell you is that my soul gloried in such a solemn and melancholy vision.
She returned to Soleure the next day, and then departed for Vevey, which she described as &quot;the land of my dreams&quot;. She rented a house on the banks of Lake Geneva and toured the countryside and mountains around Vevey. She walked up Mount Blonay where the Messieurs de Blonay hosted her at Blonay castle. After descending the mountain, the artist hired the innkeeper where she was lodged to row her out on the lake at night. She was enthralled by the charming beauty and silence of the lake, and wrote of the journey later &quot;He was not Saint Preux and I was not Julie, but I was no less happy&quot;.

Vigée Le Brun then departed for Coppet, where she met the famous dissident socialite and woman of letters Madame de Staël, who was exiled by the Napoleonic regime. She stayed at Coppet with Madame de Staël, whom she painted as Corinne, a character from Mme de Staël&#x27;s most recent novel, &quot;Corinne ou l&#x27;Italie&quot; (1807).

After returning from Coppet to Geneva, where she was made an honorary member of the Société pour l&#x27;Avancement des Beaux-Arts, she departed in a group with the de Brac family for Chamonix, intending to visit the Sallanches mountains, the Aiguille du Goûter, and Mont Blanc. The journey was perilous. The entourage visited the Bossons Glacier. On the way upwards, M. de Brac fell ill with catalepsy, and was slowly nursed back to health in a nearby inn, where Vigée Le Brun, the pregnant Mme de Brac and her son were distraught and worried about his condition, but he recuperated slowly over the course of a week. After eleven days in Chamonix, the artist departed alone without the de Brac family, writing that nothing would bring her to visit the &quot;melancholic&quot;&#x27; Chamonix again. She then left Switzerland and returned to Paris.

==== Switzerland in 1808 ====
With her desire for travel still not sated, Vigée Le Brun re-entered Switzerland in 1808 via Neuchâtel, and then visited Lucerne, where she was enchanted by the picturesque and wild town. The artist also visited Brown and the market town of Schwyz, then Zug, where she crossed Lake Zug. She visited an inn where she wanted to visit the infamous landslide of Goldau. The artist visited the valley, once populated with several villages, now buried under rocks. Heavy with sorrow, she contemplated the remains of the villages for a long time before departing for Arth. Vigée Le Brun then climbed Küssnacht, intending to visit the spot where the legendary William Tell was said to have killed Albrecht Gessler; at the time a chapel had been constructed on the location. There, the artist observed a shepherd and shepherdess singing to each other across the valley, a local courting custom, although the two stopped singing when they noticed her. The &quot;communication of love through melody&quot; presented her with a delightful scene, which she would describe as an eclogue in action.

The artist then visited Unterseen, where she was fortunate to arrive in time to witness the Shepherd&#x27;s festival at Unspunnen castle, which took place once every century. She was hosted by M. and Mme Konig, who hosted all notable people who came to visit the festivals. Vigée Le Brun went to the château du Bailli to witness the start of the festival, which had been postponed a few days due to incessant rain, and was captivated by the festival&#x27;s solemn pastoral chants and fireworks at night. The next day, she returned to see the festival taking place at half past ten in the morning; she joined the celebrations and dancing, before sitting back and watching the contests between the shepherds and shepherdesses. Vigée Le Brun recorded that she was frequently moved to tears by the enchanting atmosphere of the festival.

Coincidentally, she found Madame de Staël at the festival, and joined her in the procession that followed the Bailli and his magistrates, which was joined by people from the neighboring valleys, dressed in their local costume and carrying flags representing each canton or valley.

=== Return to Paris and later life ===
==== New home at Louveciennes, the abdications of Napoleon and Bourbon restorations ====
After returning to Paris from her second visit to Switzerland, Vigée Le Brun purchased a house in Louveciennes, Île-de-France near the Seine, and invited her niece (daughter of her brother Étienne) Caroline Rivière and her husband to live with her. She doted on the newlywed couple and formed a close bond with them, and occasionally visited Paris. She had Mme. Pourat and the talented actress Comtesse de Hocquart as neighbors. She visited Madame du Barry&#x27;s home, the Pavillon de Louveciennes, which she found had been looted and stripped clean of its furniture and contents. On 31 March 1814, her house was raided by Prussian troops who were advancing towards Paris in the final stages of the war of the Sixth Coalition. As she prepared to go to bed after eleven o&#x27;clock, with no knowledge of the proximity of the allied troops, they entered her home, while she lay in her bed. They entered her bedchamber and proceeded to loot her home. Her German-speaking Swiss servant Joseph screamed at the soldiers to spare her person until his voice was hoarse. After the looting, the soldiers left her home. She left as well, initially intending to head to Saint-Germain-des-Prés before learning that the road there was unsafe. Instead she decided to take refuge in a room above the pumping machine at Marly aqueduct, near Du Barry&#x27;s pavilion, with many other people, having entrusted her house to Joseph. As fighting nearby intensified, Vigée Le Brun attempted to take refuge in cave, but gave up after injuring her leg. There, she observed how most of the merchants taking refuge were, like her, pining for the restoration of the Bourbons.

She departed for Paris as soon as she received the news, and communicated by letter with Joseph about the condition of her Louveciennes home, which had been ransacked and its garden destroyed by the Prussian troops. Her servant wrote to her: &quot;I beg them to be less greedy, to content themselves with whatever I give them, they reply: &quot;The French have done far worse things in our country&quot;. Vigée Le Brun wrote in her memoirs &quot;The Prussians are right; poor Joseph and I had to answer for that.&quot;

Vigée Le Brun was exultant at the entry of the Comte d&#x27;Artois to Paris on 12 April, shortly after Napoleon had agreed to abdicate. She wrote to him about the King, to which he replied: &quot;His legs are still bad, but his mind is in excellent form. We will march for him, and he will think for us&quot;. She attended the euphoric reception of the King in Paris on 3 May 1814, and the restoration of the monarchy. The King personally gave her his regards while on his way to attend the Sunday services when he spotted her in a crowd.

Upon Napoleon&#x27;s return from Elba, she noted the contrast between the rapturous reception the Bourbons had received the previous year and Napoleon&#x27;s tepid welcome upon his return to France from his exile in Elba, after which he initiated the Hundred Days war. Vigée Le Brun exhibited her staunch royalist sympathies in her memoirs, writing:
Without wishing to insult the memory of a great captain and many brave generals and soldiers who helped win such resounding victories, I would like nevertheless to ask where these victories led us, and whether we still own any of the land which cost us so dear? For my part, the bulletins from the Russian campaign both distressed and revolted me; one of the later ones spoke of the loss of thousands of French soldiers and added that the Emperor had never looked so well! We read this bulletin at the home of the Bellegarde ladies, and felt so angry that we threw it on to the fire. The fact that the people were tired of these interminable wars is easily attested by their lack of enthusiasm during the Hundred Days. More than once I saw Bonaparte appear at his window and then retire immediately, furious no doubt, for the acclamation of the crowd was limited to the shouts of a hundred or so boys, paid, I believe, as an act of derision to chant long live the Emperor! There is a sharp contrast between this indifference and the joyful enthusiasm which greeted the King on his entry into Paris on the 8th of July 1815; this joy was almost universal, for after the many misfortunes incurred by Bonaparte, Louis XVIII brought only peace.

Her Louveciennes home was once again looted in the Hundred Days, this time by British troops. Among the possessions lost during this incident was a lacquer box gifted to her by the Count Stroganov during her stay at Saint Petersburg, which she had prized immensely. Her estranged husband died in August 1813, in their old home built on the Rue de-Gros-Chenet. Though they had drifted apart for several years, she was nonetheless sorely affected by his death.

In 1819 she sold her portrait of Lady Hamilton as the Comaean Sibyl to the Duc de Berri, despite it being her favorite, because she wished to satisfy the Duke. She also painted two portraits of the Duchesse de Berri, initially in the Tuileries, but then finishing their sittings in her home. In the same year, her daughter Julie died of syphilis, which devastated her. The next year, her brother Étienne died an alcoholic, leaving her niece Caroline her principal heir. Her friends advised the grief-stricken artist to travel to Bordeaux to occupy her mind with something else. She traveled first to Orléans, where she resided in the Château de Méréville, where she was mesmerized by its elegance, beauty and architecture, designed in the English Garden style; she wrote that it &quot;surpassed anything of its kind in England&quot;. She toured the city and sampled its architecture and landmarks, including the cathedral and the ruins surrounding the city. She then traveled to Blois where she visited the Château de Chambord, which she described it as &quot;a romantic, fairy tale place&quot;. She then visited the Château de Chanteloup, residence of the late Étienne François, duc de Choiseul. Afterwards, she traveled to Tours, where the impure air forced her to quit the city after only two days. In Tours, she was received by the director of the academy, who offered to be her guide in the city. She also visited the ruins of the Marmoutier monastery. She then passed Poitiers and Angoulême on her way to Bordeaux. After arriving in Bordeaux, she stayed in the Fumel Hospice and was received there by the prefect, the Comte Camille de Tournon-Simiane. She toured the countryside and visited the cemetery, which she praised for its sepulchral beauty and symmetrical layout. It became her second-favorite after the Père La Chaise cemetery of Paris. She also visited the synagogue of Bordeaux, styled after the temple of Solomon, the ruins of the ancient Roman Gallien Arena. After spending a week in Bordeaux, she started back for Paris, greatly satisfied with her travels. During her journey, it was common for her to be mistaken for a noble lady owing to her expensive carriage; she later lamented in her memoirs that this often meant she had to pay more in the inns where she resided.

Her journey to Bordeaux was the last time she traveled extensively.

==== Friendship with Antoine Jean-Gros ====
The artist formed an intimate friendship with Antoine-Jean Gros, whom she had known since he was seven years old and had painted his portrait when he was at that age, during which she had noticed an artistic inclination in the child. Upon her return to France she was surprised to find Gros had become a successful and famous painter, head of his own school of art. Gros was socially reclusive, and often brusque to others, but he formed a close bond with Vigée Le Brun, who wrote: &quot;Gros was always a man of natural impulses. He was prone to feel the keenest sensations and would become equally passionate over a kind action or a beautiful work of art. He was ill at ease in society, rarely breaking the silence in a crowded place, but he listened attentively and replied with his gentle smile, or by a single word, always very apt. To appreciate Gros, one had to know him intimately. Then he would open up his heart, a kind and noble one at that; some people reproached him for having a certain brusqueness of tone, but this disappeared entirely in private. His conversation was even more fascinating because he never expressed himself in the same way as other men; always finding the most unusual and powerful images to convey a thought, you might almost say he painted with words.&quot;

She was greatly affected by his suicide in 1835; she had met him the day before and noted him brooding over criticism he had received over one of his paintings &quot;Hercules and Diomedes&quot;.

==== Later years ====
She spent most of her time in Louveciennes, typically eight months of the year. She formed new friendships with people including the writer and man of letters M. de Briffaut, the playwright Jean-Baptiste-Denis Despré, the writer Aimé Martin, the composer Marc-Antoine Madeleine Désaugiers, the painter and antiquarian Comte de Forbin, and the famous painter Antoine-Jean Gros. She hosted these people and socialized with them regularly in her countryside home or in Paris, as well as her old friend the Princess Kourakin. She painted Saint Geneviève, with the face being a posthumous portrait of 12-year old Julie. For the local chapel, the Comtesse de Genlis graced this painting with two separate poems; one for the saint, the other for the painter. She spent her time with her nieces Caroline Rivière and Eugénie Tripier-Le Franc, whom she came to regard as her own children. She had tutored the latter in painting since childhood and was greatly pleased to see her blossom into a professional artist. Eugénie and Caroline would assist her in writing her memoirs, late in her life. She died in Paris on 30 March 1842, aged 86. She was buried at the Cimetière de Louveciennes near her old home. Her tombstone epitaph says &quot;Ici, enfin, je repose...&quot; (Here, at last, I rest...).

== Exhibitions ==
During her lifetime, Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s work was publicly exhibited in Paris at the Académie de Saint-Luc (1774), Salon de la Correspondance (1779, 1781, 1782, 1783) and Salon of the Académie in Paris (1783, 1785, 1787, 1789, 1791, 1798, 1802, 1817, 1824).

The first retrospective exhibition of Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s work was held in 1982 at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. The first major international retrospective exhibition of her art premiered at the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais in Paris (2015–2016). It was subsequently shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (2016) and the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa (2016).

== Portrayal in popular culture ==
The 2014 docudrama made for French television, &quot;Le fabuleux destin d&#x27;Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun,&quot; directed by Arnaud Xainte, and starring Marlène Goulard and Julie Ravix as the young and old Élisabeth respectively, is available in English as &quot;The Fabulous Life of Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun.&quot;

An episode of the 1980 BBC television series, 100 Great Paintings, presented by the art historian and author, Anita Brookner, featured Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s &quot;Self-portrait with her Daughter, 1789&quot;.

In the episode &quot;The Portrait&quot; from the BBC series &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot; (1999) written by Peter Learmouth, starring Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Madame Vigée Le Brun (Maggie Steed) paints a portrait of the Comtesse de Vache (Jennifer Saunders) weeping over a dead canary.

Vigée Le Brun is one of only three characters in Joel Gross&#x27;s &quot;Marie Antoinette: The Color of Flesh&quot; (premiered in 2007), a fictionalized historical drama about a love triangle set against the backdrop of the French Revolution.

Vigée Le Brun&#x27;s portrait of Marie Antoinette is featured on the cover of the 2010 album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Hole.

Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun is a dateable non-player character in the historically-based dating sim video game &quot;Ambition: A Minuet in Power&quot; published by Joy Manufacturing Co.

Singer-songwriter Kelly Chase released the song &quot;Portrait of a Queen&quot; in 2021 to accompany the History Detective Podcast, Season 2, Episode 3 Marie Antionette&#x27;s Portrait Artist: Vigée Le Brun.

<doc id="9949" wikidata="Q128620" url="?curid=9949" title="Epistle to the Galatians">
<text>The Epistle to the Galatians is the ninth book of the New Testament. It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by &quot;Galatians,&quot; an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia. The letter was originally written in Koine Greek and later translated into other languages.

In this letter, Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the Gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ. The Epistle to the Galatians has exerted enormous influence on the history of Christianity, the development of Christian theology, and the study of the Apostle Paul.

The central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how Gentiles could convert to Christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of Christians were Jewish or Jewish proselytes, which historians refer to as the Jewish Christians. Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large. This puts it during the lifetime of Paul himself.

==Background ==

===Surviving early manuscripts===

The original of the letter (autograph) is not known to survive. Papyrus 46, the earliest reasonably complete version available to scholars today, dates to approximately AD 200, around 150 years after the original was drafted. This papyrus is fragmented in a few areas, causing some of the original text to be missing. The text of surviving manuscripts varies. Biblical scholar Bruce Metzger writes: &quot;through careful research relating to paper construction, handwriting development, and the established principles of textual criticism, scholars can be rather certain about where these errors and changes appeared and what the original text probably said.&quot;

Surviving early complete and partial manuscripts include:
*Papyrus 46 (~AD 200)
*Codex Vaticanus (325-350)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330-360)
*Papyrus 51 (~400)
*Papyrus 99 (~400)
*Uncial 0176 (4th/5th century) 
*Codex Alexandrinus (400-440)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450)
*Codex Freerianus (~450)
*Codex Claromontanus (~550)

=== Authorship and date ===
==== Authorship ====

Biblical scholars agree that Galatians is a true example of Paul&#x27;s writing. The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus. George S. Duncan described its authenticity as &quot;unquestioned. In every line it betrays its origin as a genuine letter of Paul.&quot; 
==== Date ====

A majority of scholars agree that Galatians was written between the late 40s and early 50s, although some date the original composition to . Jon Jordan notes that an interesting point to be made in the search for the dating of Galatians concerns whether or not it is a response to the Council of Jerusalem or a factor leading up to the Council. He writes, &quot;did Paul&#x27;s argument in Galatians flow out of the Jerusalem Council&#x27;s decision, or did it come before the Jerusalem Council and possibly help shape that very decision?&quot; It would have been enormously helpful to Paul&#x27;s argument if he could have mentioned the decision of the Council of Jerusalem that Gentiles should not be circumcised. The absence of this argument from Paul strongly implies Galatians was written prior to the council. Since the council took place in 48–49 AD, and Paul evangelized South Galatia in 47–48 AD, the most plausible date for the writing of Galatians is 48 AD.

=== Audience ===
Paul&#x27;s letter is addressed &quot;to the churches of Galatia&quot;, but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. Most scholars agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul&#x27;s day. Acts records Paul traveling to the &quot;region of Galatia and Phrygia&quot;, which lies immediately west of Galatia. Some scholars have argued that &quot;Galatia&quot; is an ethnic reference to &quot;Galatians,&quot; a Celtic people living in northern Asia Minor.

The New Testament indicates that Paul spent time personally in the cities of Galatia (Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe) during his missionary journeys. They seem to have been composed mainly of Gentile converts. After Paul&#x27;s departure, the churches were led astray from Paul&#x27;s trust/faith-centered teachings by individuals proposing &quot;another gospel&quot; (which centered on salvation through the Mosaic Law, so-called legalism), whom Paul saw as preaching a &quot;different gospel&quot; from what Paul had taught. The Galatians appear to have been receptive to the teaching of these newcomers, and the epistle is Paul&#x27;s response to what he sees as their willingness to turn from his teaching.

The identity of these &quot;opponents&quot; is disputed. However, the majority of modern scholars view them as Jewish Christians, who taught that in order for converts to belong to the People of God, they must be subject to some or all of the Jewish Law (i.e. Judaizers). The letter indicates controversy concerning circumcision, Sabbath observance, and the Mosaic Covenant. It would appear, from Paul&#x27;s response, that they cited the example of Abraham, who was circumcised as a mark of receiving the covenant blessings. They certainly appear to have questioned Paul&#x27;s authority as an apostle, perhaps appealing to the greater authority of the Jerusalem church governed by James (brother of Jesus).

====North Galatian view====
The North Galatian view holds that the epistle was written very soon after Paul&#x27;s second visit to Galatia. In this view, the visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in Galatians 2:1–10, is identical with that of Acts 15, which is spoken of as a thing of the past. Consequently, the epistle seems to have been written after the Council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and the epistle to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at roughly the same time, during Paul&#x27;s stay in Macedonia in roughly 56–57.

This third date takes the word &quot;quickly&quot; in literally. John P. Meier suggests that Galatians was &quot;written in the middle or late 50s, only a few years after the Antiochene incident he narrates&quot;. Eminent biblical scholar Helmut Koester also subscribes to the &quot;North Galatian Hypothesis&quot;. Koester points out that the cities of Galatia in the north consist of Ankyra, Pessinus, and Gordium (of the Gordian Knot fame of Alexander the Great).

====South Galatian view====
The South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian, or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.

====Earliest epistle====
A third theory is that Galatians 2:1–10 describes Paul and Barnabas&#x27; visit to Jerusalem described in Acts 11:30 and 12:25. This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul&#x27;s epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal. 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27–28). This view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the Gentiles precludes the Acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with Acts 11. It further holds that continuing to remember the poor (Gal. 2:10) fits with the purpose of the Acts 11 visit, but not Acts 15.

In addition, the exclusion of any mention of the letter of Acts 15 is seen to indicate that such a letter did not yet exist, since Paul would have been likely to use it against the legalism confronted in Galatians. Finally, this view doubts Paul&#x27;s confrontation of Peter (Gal. 2:11) would have been necessary after the events described in Acts 15. If this view is correct, the epistle should be dated somewhere around 47, depending on other difficult-to-date events, such as Paul&#x27;s conversion.

Kirsopp Lake found this view less likely and wondered why it would be necessary for the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) to take place at all if the issue were settled in Acts 11:30/12:25, as this view holds. Defenders of the view do not think it unlikely an issue of such magnitude would need to be discussed more than once. New Testament scholar J.B. Lightfoot also objected to this view since it &quot;clearly implies that his [Paul&#x27;s] Apostolic office and labours were well known and recognized before this conference.&quot;

Defenders of this view, such as Ronald Fung, disagree with both parts of Lightfoot&#x27;s statement, insisting Paul received his &quot;Apostolic Office&quot; at his conversion (Gal. 1:15–17; Acts 9). Fung holds, then, that Paul&#x27;s apostolic mission began almost immediately in Damascus (Acts 9:20). While accepting that Paul&#x27;s apostolic anointing was likely only recognized by the Apostles in Jerusalem during the events described in Galatians 2/Acts 11:30, Fung does not see this as a problem for this theory.

=== Paul&#x27;s opponents ===
Scholars have debated whether it is possible to reconstruct the arguments against which Paul is arguing. Though these opponents have traditionally been designated as Judaizers, this classification has fallen out of favor in contemporary scholarship. Some instead refer to them as Agitators. While many scholars have claimed that Paul&#x27;s opponents were circumcisionist Jewish followers of Jesus, the ability to make such determinations with a reasonable degree of certainty has been called into question. It has often been presumed that they traveled from Jerusalem, but some commentators have raised the question of whether they may have actually been insiders familiar with the dynamics of the community. Furthermore, some commentaries and articles pointed out the inherent problems in mirror-reading, emphasizing that there is not sufficient evidence to reconstruct the arguments of Paul&#x27;s opponents. It is not enough to simply reverse his denials and assertions as it does not result in a coherent argument nor can it possibly reflect the thought processes of his opponents accurately. It is nearly impossible to reconstruct the opponents from Paul&#x27;s text because their representation is necessarily polemical. All that can be said with any certainty is that they supported a different position of Gentile relations with Jews than Paul did.

==Contents==

This epistle addresses the question of whether the Gentiles in Galatia were obligated to follow Mosaic Law to be part of the Christ community. After an introductory address, the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle.

In the first two chapters, Paul discusses his life before Christ and his early ministry, including interactions with other apostles in Jerusalem. This is the most extended discussion of Paul&#x27;s past that we find in the Pauline letters (cf. Philippians 3:1–7). Some have read this autobiographical narrative as Paul&#x27;s defense of his apostolic authority. Others, however, see Paul&#x27;s telling of the narrative as making an argument to the Galatians about the nature of the gospel and the Galatians&#x27; own situation. The two instances of the word &quot;Judaism&quot; in Galatians 1:13-14 are the only references to it in the whole New Testament; not until half a century later in the writings of Ignatius would &quot;Judaism&quot; and &quot;Christianity&quot; be considered two &quot;religions&quot;.

Galatians 2:11-14 describes the incident at Antioch, a reported dispute between the apostles Paul and Peter over whether to continue following the Law of Moses on issues like circumcision.

Chapter 3 exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus. Paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of Abraham and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. Paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of Abraham, Christ, has come. Chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by 5:1–6:10 teaching about the right use of their Christian freedom. Chapter 5 also discusses circumcision.

In the conclusion of the epistle, Paul wrote, &quot;See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.&quot; (Galatians 6:11, ESV) Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says:

Some commentators have postulated that Paul&#x27;s large letters are owed to his poor eyesight, his deformed hands, or to other physical, mental, or psychological afflictions. Other commentators have attributed Paul&#x27;s large letters to his poor education, his attempt to assert his authority, or his effort to emphasize his final words. Classics scholar Steve Reece has compared similar autographic subscriptions in thousands of Greek, Roman, and Jewish letters of this period and observes that large letters are a normal feature when senders of letters, regardless of their education, take the pen from their amanuensis and add a few words of greeting in their own hands.

Galatians 5:14 mentions the Great Commandment. Galatians 5:22-23 describes the Fruit of the Holy Spirit, a list of attributes the author says indicate people living in accord with the Holy Spirit. Lists of virtues like this and also of vices (such as those found immediately prior in Galatians 5:19-21) were a form of ethical instruction very common in the Greco-Roman world and a popular formulation of ancient Christian ethics.

Probably the most famous single statement made in the Epistle, by Paul, is in chapter 3, verse 28: &quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; The debate surrounding that verse is legend and the two schools of thought are (1) this only applies to the spiritual standing of people in the eyes of God, it does not implicate social distinctions and gender roles on earth; and (2) this is not just about our spiritual standing but is also about how we relate to each other and treat each other in the here and now.

Position (1) emphasises the immediate context of the verse and notes that it is embedded in a discussion about justification: our relationship with God. Position (2) reminds its critics that the &quot;whole letter context&quot; is very much about how people got on in the here and now together, and in fact the discussion about justification came out of an actual example of people treating other people differently (2:11ff).

==Major issues==
=== Paul and the law ===
Much variety exists in discussions of Paul&#x27;s view of the Law in Galatians. Nicole Chibici-Revneanu noticed a difference in Paul&#x27;s treatment of the Law in Galatians and Romans. In Galatians the law is described as the &quot;oppressor&quot; whereas in Romans Paul describes the Law as being just as much in need of the Spirit to set it free from sin as humans are. Peter Oakes argues that Galatians cannot be construed as depicting the law positively because the Law played the role it was meant to play in the scope of human history. Wolfgang Reinbold argues that, contrary to the popular reading of Paul, the Law was possible to keep.

=== Under law and works of law ===
Regarding &quot;under the law&quot; (Gal. 3:23; 4:4, 5, 21; 5:18), Todd Wilson argues that &quot;under the law&quot; in Galatians was a &quot;rhetorical abbreviation for &#x27;under the curse of the law. Regarding &quot;works of the law&quot; (Gal. 2:16), Robert Keith Rapa argues Paul is speaking of viewing Torah-observances as the means of salvation which he is seeking to combat in the Galatian congregation. Jacqueline de Roo noticed a similar phrase in the works found at Qumran and argues that &quot;works of the law&quot; is speaking of obedience to the Torah acting as a way of being atoned for. Michael Bachmann argues that this phrase is a mention of certain actions taken by Jewish people to distinguish themselves and perpetuate separation between themselves and Gentiles.

=== Law of Christ ===
Much debate surrounds what Paul means by &quot;law of Christ&quot; in Galatians 6:2, a phrase that occurs only once in all of Paul&#x27;s letters. As Schreiner explains, some scholars think that the &quot;law of Christ&quot; is the sum of Jesus&#x27;s words, functioning as a &quot;new Torah for believers&quot;. Others argue that the &quot;genitive in the &#x27;law of Christ&#x27; &#x27;should be understood as explanatory, i.e. the law which is Christ. Some focus on the relationship between the law of Christ and the Old Testament Decalogue. Still other scholars argue that whereas the &quot;Mosaic law is abolished&quot;, the new &quot;law of Christ fits with the Zion Torah&quot;, which &quot;hails from Zion ... and is eschatological&quot;. Schreiner himself believes that the law of Christ is equivalent to Galatians 5:13–14&#x27;s &quot;law of love&quot;. According to Schreiner, when believers love others, &quot;they behave as Christ did and fulfill his law&quot;.

=== Antioch incident ===
As Thomas Schreiner explains, there is significant debate over the meaning of Peter&#x27;s eating with the Gentiles—specifically, why might the eating have been considered wrong? E. P. Sanders argues that though Jews could eat in the same location with Gentiles, Jews did not want to consume food from the same vessels used by Gentiles. As Sanders explains, Galatia&#x27;s Jews and Gentiles might have had to share the same cup and loaf (i.e. food from the same vessels). Other scholars such as James Dunn argue that Cephas was &quot;already observing the basic food laws of the Torah&quot; and then &quot;men from James advocated an even stricter observance&quot;. Schreiner himself argues that Peter &quot;actually ate unclean food—food prohibited by the OT law—before the men from James came&quot;. Depending on how one construes &quot;eating with the Gentiles&quot; in Galatians 2:12, one may reach different conclusions as to why Paul was so angry with Peter in Antioch.
There is debate about the meaning of the phrase in Galatians 2:16. Grammatically, this phrase can be interpreted either as an objective genitive &quot;through faith in Jesus Christ&quot; or as a subjective genitive &quot;through the faith of Jesus Christ&quot;. There are theological ramifications to each position, but given the corpus of the Pauline literature, the majority of scholars have treated as an objective genitive, translating it as &quot;faith in Jesus Christ&quot;. Daniel Harrington writes, &quot;the subjective genitive does not oppose or do away with the concept of faith in Christ. Rather, it reestablishes priorities. One is justified by the faith of Jesus Christ manifested in his obedience to God by his death upon the cross. It is on the basis of that faith that one believes in Christ&quot;.

=== Sexuality and gender ===
Galatians 3:28 says, &quot;There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.&quot; According to Norbert Baumert, Galatians 3:28 is Paul&#x27;s declaration that one can be in relationship with Jesus no matter their gender. Judith Gundry-Volf argues for a more general approach, stating that one&#x27;s gender does not provide any benefit or burden. Pamela Eisenbaum argues that Paul was exhorting his readers to be mindful in changing conduct in relationships that involved people of different status. Ben Witherington argues that Paul is combatting the position espoused by opponents who were attempting to influence Paul&#x27;s community to return to the patriarchal standards held by the majority culture.

There are two different interpretations within the modern scholarship regarding the meaning and function of Paul&#x27;s statement that &quot;there is no longer male and female&quot;. The first interpretation states that Paul&#x27;s words eliminate the biological differences between males and females and thus calls gender roles into question. Nancy Bedford says that this does not mean that there is no distinction between males and females; instead, it means that there is no room for gender hierarchy in the gospel. The second interpretation, outlined by Jeremy Punt, argues that &quot;there is no longer [...] male or female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus&quot; refers only to the universality of salvation through Christ—which does not discriminate ethnicity, social status or gender—but is not intended to communicate any ideology of gender equality. Punt contends that here, Paul&#x27;s intention was to fix social conflicts rather than to alter gender norms; by stating the importance of becoming one in Christ, Paul tries to give his society a new identity (i.e., the identity &quot;in Christ&quot;), thereby putatively encouraging concord between believers—without thence advocating any substantive changes to the rôle or rights of women.

=== Meaning of &quot;Israel of God&quot; ===
Many scholars debate the meaning of the phrase &quot;Israel of God&quot; in Galatians 6:16, wherein Paul wishes for &quot;peace and mercy&quot; to be &quot;even upon the Israel of God&quot;. As Schreiner explains, scholars debate whether &quot;Israel of God&quot; refers to ethnically Jewish believers &quot;within the church of Jesus Christ&quot;, or to the church of Christ as a whole (Jewish and Gentiles all included). Those who believe that &quot;Israel of God&quot; only refers to ethnically Jewish believers, argue that had Paul meant the entire church, he would use the word &quot;mercy&quot; before &quot;peace&quot;, because Paul &quot;sees peace as the petition for the church, while mercy is the request for unredeemed Jews&quot;. Other scholars, such as G. K. Beale, argue that the Old Testament backdrop of Galatians 6:16—e.g. a verse such as Isaiah 54:10 wherein God promises mercy and peace to Israel—suggests that &quot;the Israel of God&quot; refers to a portion of the new, eschatological Israel &quot;composed of Jews and Gentiles&quot;. 

==Significance and reception==
=== Luther&#x27;s theology and antisemitism ===
Luther’s fundamental belief in justification by faith was formed in large part by his interpretation of Galatians. Masaki claims 

This development led to some schools of thought, such as Canadian religious historian Barrie Wilson who points out in &quot;How Jesus Became Christian,&quot; how Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Galatians represents a sweeping rejection of Jewish Law (Torah). In so doing, Paul clearly takes his Christ movement out of the orbit of Judaism and into an entirely different milieu. Paul&#x27;s stance constitutes a major contrast to the position of James, brother of Jesus, whose group in Jerusalem adhered to the observance of Torah.

=== Gender, sexuality, and modern scholarship ===
Galatians 3:28 is one of the most controversial and influential verses in Galatians. There are three different pairs that Paul uses to elaborate his ideology. The first one is &quot;Jew or Greek&quot;, the second one is &quot;slave or free&quot;, and the third one is &quot;male and female&quot;, Paul states that in Jesus Christ there is no longer a distinction between them. However, the meaning of this verse is not expounded upon further by Paul. In modern politics, the debate about the meaning of Galatians 3:28 is significant, as it is used by different people and scholars in order to make normative claims about sexuality, gender, and even marriage. The ongoing nature of this debate reveals that scholars still have not come to a unified conclusion regarding Paul&#x27;s theology.

<doc id="9950" wikidata="Q51613" url="?curid=9950" title="Epistle to the Philippians">
<text>The Epistle to the Philippians is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle and Timothy is named with him as co-author or co-sender. The letter is addressed to the Christian church in Philippi. Paul, Timothy, Silas (and perhaps Luke) first visited Philippi in Greece (Macedonia) during Paul&#x27;s second missionary journey from Antioch, which occurred between approximately 50 and 52 AD. In the account of his visit in the Acts of the Apostles, Paul and Silas are accused of &quot;disturbing the city&quot;.

There is a general consensus that Philippians consists of authentically Pauline material, and that the epistle is a composite of multiple letter fragments from Paul to the church in Philippi. These letters could have been written from Ephesus in 52–55 AD or Caesarea Maritima in 57–59, but the most likely city of provenance is Rome, around 62 AD, or about 10 years after Paul&#x27;s first visit to Philippi.

== Composition ==

Starting in the 1960s, a consensus emerged among biblical scholars that Philippians was not written as one unified letter, but rather as a compilation of fragments from three separate letters from Paul to the church in Philippi. According to Philip Sellew, Philippians contains the following letter fragments:
* Letter A consists of Philippians 4:10–20. It is a short thank-you note from Paul to the Philippian church, regarding gifts they had sent him.
* Letter B consists of Philippians 1:1–3:1, and may also include 4:4–9 and 4:21–23.
* Letter C consists of Philippians 3:2–4:1, and may also include 4:2–3. It is a testament to Paul&#x27;s rejection of all worldly things for the sake of the gospel of Jesus.
In support of the idea that Philippians is a composite work, Sellew pointed to the abrupt shifts in tone and topic within the text. There also seem to be chronological inconsistencies from one chapter to the next concerning Paul&#x27;s associate Epaphroditus:
These letter fragments likely would have been edited into a single document by the first collector of the Pauline corpus, although there is no clear consensus among scholars regarding who this initial collector may have been, or when the first collection of Pauline epistles may have been published.

Today, a number of scholars believe that Philippians is a composite of multiple letter fragments. According to the theologian G. Walter Hansen, &quot;The traditional view that Philippians was composed as one letter in the form presented in the NT &quot;[New Testament]&quot; can no longer claim widespread support.&quot;

Regardless of the literary unity of the letter, scholars agree that the material that was compiled into the Epistle to the Philippians was originally composed in Koine Greek, sometime during the 50s or early 60s AD.

===Place of writing===
It is uncertain where Paul was when he wrote the letter(s) that make up Philippians. Internal evidence in the letter itself points clearly to it being composed while Paul was in custody, but it is unclear &quot;which&quot; period of imprisonment the letter refers to. If the sequence of events given in the Acts of the Apostles is to be trusted, candidates would include the Roman imprisonment at the end of Acts, and the earlier Caesarean imprisonment. Any identification of the place of writing of Philippians is complicated by the fact that some scholars view Acts as being an unreliable source of information about the early Church.

Jim Reiher has suggested that the letters could stem from the second period of Roman imprisonment attested by early church fathers. The main reasons suggested for a later date include:
# The letter&#x27;s highly developed Ecclesiology
# An impending sense of death permeating the letter
# The absence of any mention of Luke in a letter to Luke&#x27;s home church (when the narrative in Acts clearly suggests that Luke was with Paul in his first Roman imprisonment)
# A harsher imprisonment than the open house arrest of his first Roman imprisonment
# A similar unique expression that is shared only with 2 Timothy
# A similar disappointment with co-workers shared only with 2 Timothy

==Surviving early manuscripts==

==Chapters 1 and 2==
In Chapters 1 and 2 of Philippians (Letter B), Paul sends word to the Philippians of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in the face of death, along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the Lord despite one&#x27;s circumstances. Paul assures the Philippians that his imprisonment is actually helping to spread the Christian message, rather than hindering it. He also expresses gratitude for the devotion and heroism of Epaphroditus, whom the Philippian church had sent to visit Paul and bring him gifts. Some time during his visit with Paul, Epaphroditus apparently contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness. But he recovers before being sent back to the Philippians.

===Greeting (1:1–2)===
The epistle opens using a formula found in other Paul&#x27;s epistles, here with the introduction of himself and Timothy as Christ&#x27;s &quot;slaves&quot; (&quot;bondservants&quot;) as in .
Verse 1:1 is translated in the New King James Version as:
: &quot;Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ,
:: &quot;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:&quot;
&quot;Bishops and deacons&quot; could be translated as &quot;overseers&quot; and &quot;helpers&quot;; their functions in the church were not the same as they would later become.

Verse 1:2 is translated:
: &quot;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;
The wording is identical to .

===Thanksgiving and prayer (1:3–11)===
This is a common feature in Paul&#x27;s epistles. Except in Galatians, Paul thanks or blesses God for the good things he has heard about a particular church in the beginning of his letters. In this epistle, Paul mixes it with his &quot;prayer&quot; for the church (1:3–4) and with &quot;joy&quot; (1:5), &quot;a combination he will recommend in 4:6&quot;. Lutheran pietist Johann Albrecht Bengel says that the whole letter can this be summarised: &quot;The sum of the epistle is, &quot;I rejoice, rejoice ye&quot;&quot;. Similarly Paul writes to the Thessalonians: &quot;Rejoice always; pray without ceasing&quot;.

===Paul&#x27;s situation in chains (1:12–26)===
This section deals with Paul&#x27;s condition during the confinement in a Roman administrative center, where he could still preach the gospel. It consists of two subsections with distinctive keywords: the first subsection (verses 12–18) was marked off with two words, &quot;progress&quot; (&quot;prokope&quot;; verse 12) and &quot;confidence&quot; (verse 14), whereas the second subsection (verses 19–26) has the &quot;inclusio&quot; markers &quot;joy&quot;, &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;trusting&quot;.

Verse 1:21 is translated:
:&quot;For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&quot;
&quot;To die is gain&quot;: that is, when a believer dies one enters into the presence of God, where fullness of joy is, and immediately with Christ, which is far better than being alive here. This common interpretation is shown by the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopian versions, which read, &quot;to die (or &quot;if I die&quot;), it is gain to me&quot;.

===Unity of minds and hearts (2:1–4)===
This section centers on Paul&#x27;s appeal for unity of minds and hearts among the people, which can be expressed by four phrases: two using the keyword &quot;phronein&quot; (&quot;of the same mind&quot; or &quot;of one mind&quot;), then &quot;agape&quot; (&quot;love&quot;) and &quot;sumpsuchoi&quot; (&quot;united in soul&quot; or &quot;being in full accord&quot;). Maintaining his reference to the joy which Paul already feels in respect to the Philippians ( and ), he speaks of this joy being &quot;made full, like a measure&quot;.

Verse 2:1 is translated in the King James Version:
:&quot;If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,&quot;
Meyer notes Paul&#x27;s use of &quot;four stimulative elements&quot;, which are assumed to apply and are not conditional. H. C. G. Moule notes that the word &quot;bowels&quot;, as in the King James Version, was not used in any English version before 1582, and offers &quot;tender mercies and compassions&quot;, as in the Revised Version (1881), as better wording: likewise the New International Version (1973 onwards) refers to &quot;tenderness and compassion.

===Christ poem (2:5–11)===
Chapter 2 of the epistle contains a famous poem describing the nature of Christ and his act of redemption:
Due to its unique poetic style, Bart D. Ehrman suggests that this passage constitutes an early Christian poem that was composed by someone else prior to Paul&#x27;s writings, as early as the mid-late 30s AD and was later used by Paul in his epistle. While the passage is often called a &quot;hymn&quot;, some scholars believe this to be an inappropriate name since it does not have a rhythmic or metrical structure in the original Greek. This theory was first proposed by German Protestant theologian Ernst Lohmeyer in 1928, and this &quot;has come to dominate both exegesis of Philippians and study of early Christology and credal formulas&quot;.

The Frankfurt silver inscription, the oldest known reliable evidence for Christianity north of the Alps (dating from between 230 and 270), quotes a Latin translation of Philippians 2:10–11.

==== Incarnation Christology ====
Some find the Christ poem significant because it strongly suggests that there were very early Christians who understood Jesus to be a pre-existent celestial being, who chose to take on human form, rather than a human who was later exalted to a divine status.

While the author of the poem apparently believed that Jesus existed in heaven before his physical incarnation, there is some debate about whether he was believed to be &quot;equal&quot; to God the Father prior to his death and resurrection. This largely depends on how the Greek words &quot;morphe&quot; (μορφή) and &quot;harpagmon&quot; (, accusative form of ) are understood.

Scholars such as English theologian J.B. Lightfoot have argued that &quot;morphe&quot; should be understood in the Aristotelean sense of &quot;essential nature&quot;, but more recent scholarship by Robert B. Strimple and Paul D. Feinberg has questioned whether a first century Jewish author would have had Aristotelean philosophy in mind, preferring instead the plainer translation of the word &quot;morphe&quot; as simply &quot;appearance&quot;. In this view, the text does not state that Jesus &quot;is&quot; God, but merely that he had the &quot;appearance&quot; of a god (v. 6) but was revealed to be a man (v. 8). Strimple writes, &quot;For years I tried to maintain the view of Lightfoot that Paul here uses &quot;morphe&quot; with the sense it had acquired in Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotelian... But I have had to conclude that there is really very little evidence to support the conclusion that Paul uses &quot;morphe&quot; in such a philosophical sense here.&quot; Likewise, Feinberg cautions, &quot;the attractiveness of the Greek philosophical interpretation of &quot;morphe&quot; is that it gives the theologian about as strong an affirmation of the deity of Christ as is possible... One must, however, be careful that he does not read his theological convictions into the text when they are not there.&quot;

The Greek word &quot;harpagmon&quot; translated in verse 6 (&quot;Something to be grasped after / exploited&quot;) is also a subject of much scholarly debate. If &quot;harpagmon&quot; is rendered as &quot;something to be exploited,&quot; as it is in many Christian Bible translations, then the implication is that Christ was already equal to God prior to his incarnation. But Bart Ehrman and others have argued that the correct translation is in fact &quot;something to be grasped after,&quot; implying that Jesus was &quot;not&quot; equal to God before his resurrection. Outside of this passage, &quot;harpagmon&quot; and related words were almost always used to refer to something that a person doesn&#x27;t yet possess but tries to acquire.

Following this interpretation of &quot;harpagmon,&quot; scholars such as James D.G. Dunn and Oscar Cullman suggest the author may be drawing a parallel between Adam and Jesus, who in other Pauline literature is called the Last Adam. The first Adam was made in the &quot;image of God&quot; (Genesis 1:26) but sinned by trying to grasp equality with God (Genesis 3:5). In contrast, Jesus, also made in the image of God (Phil. 2:5) did &quot;not&quot; try to grasp equality with God, but instead, humbled himself in obedience to God. Dunn sees the hymn as an archetypal parallel to Genesis: &quot;The Philippians hymn is an attempt to read the life and work of Christ through the grid of Adam theology... the hymn is the epochal significance of the Christ-event, as determinative for humankind as the &#x27;event&#x27; of Adam&#x27;s creation and fall... Christ by his life, death, and resurrection has so completely reversed the catastrophe of Adam, has done so by the acceptance of death by choice rather than as punishment, as has thus completed the role of dominion over all things originally intended for Adam... It was Adam who was &#x27;in the form of God&#x27;... the language was used... to bring out that Adamic character of Christ&#x27;s life, death, and resurrection. So archetypal was Jesus&#x27; work in its effect that it can be described in language appropriate to archetypal man and as a reversal of the archetypal sin.&quot; 

Similarly, Cullman also notes the parallel between &quot;form of God&quot; in Phil. 2:5 and &quot;image of God&quot; in Genesis 1:26, &quot;The expression &quot;morphe&quot; firmly establishes the connection between Jesus and the creation story of Adam... this Greek word corresponds to the Hebrew &#x27;image&#x27; of Genesis 1:26... &quot;morphe&quot; in Phil. 2:6 is immediately related to the concept &quot;eikon&quot; (image) since the Semitic root word or its synonym can correspond to either of the two Greek words. This means that v. 6 does not refer to Jesus&#x27; divine &#x27;nature&#x27; but rather to the image of God which he possessed from the beginning.&quot;

Although scholars remain divided on the question of the pre-existent Christ&#x27;s equality with God, it is widely agreed by interpreters that the Christ poem depicts Jesus as equal to God &quot;after&quot; his resurrection. This is because the last two stanzas quote Isaiah 45:22–23: (&quot;Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess&quot;), which in the original context clearly refers to God the Father. Some scholars argue that Philippians 2:6–11 identifies Jesus with God from his pre-existence on the basis that allusions to Isaiah 45:22–23 are present all throughout the poem.

===Timothy and Epaphroditus, Paul&#x27;s go-betweens (2:19–30)===
Two of Paul&#x27;s helpers, Timothy and Epaphroditus, are introduced and the reasons for their journey are explained in this part, mainly to show Paul&#x27;s affection for the people of Philippi.

==3:1-4:1==
In Chapter 3 (Letter C), Paul warns the Philippians about those Christians who insist that circumcision is necessary for salvation. He testifies that while he once was a devout Pharisee and follower of the Jewish law, he now considers these things to be worthless and worldly compared to the gospel of Jesus.

===Paul&#x27;s re-evaluation of values through Christ (3:1–11)===
Paul tells his own story and says how he &quot;emptied himself&quot; for Christ&#x27;s sake and how his ultimate goal was now to follow the &quot;upward call of God&quot; (verse 14) to the end. Paul describes how his values had changed since becoming a follower of Christ. Jesuit theologian Robert Murray describes this process as a &quot;transvaluation of values&quot;, using a phrase adopted from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.

Verse 3 is translated:
: &quot;For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,&quot;
*&quot;Worship&quot;: from Greek word , , which is &#x27;used specially of the Jewish ceremonial service&#x27; (cf. ; ; ).

Verse 3:5 is translated:
: &quot;circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;&quot;
*&quot;Circumcised the eight day&quot;: according to (cf. Luke 2:21 of Jesus), so Paul became &quot;a member of the covenant from infancy&quot;.
*&quot;Tribe of Benjamin&quot;: Paul also stated his tribe in .

Verse 3:8 is translated:
: &quot;Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ&quot;

*&quot;I count all things loss&quot;: in comparison to knowing Christ, anything else falls short.
*&quot;The excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus&quot;: is not meant subjectively about the knowledge &quot;in Christ&quot; or &quot;about Christ&quot; (as God or as man), but objectively, knowing him in person, as God of all, mainly as &quot;Savior and Redeemer&quot;, as Paul emphasizes using the words, &quot;my Lord&quot;. The knowledge is attained, not by natural enlightenment, nor by reasoning, nor by the law of Moses, but by the Gospel of the grace of God. The efficient cause of this knowledge is God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; the Father reveals Christ to his followers; the Son gives them an understanding to know him; and the Spirit gives wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. This spiritual knowledge of Christ is more excellent than a knowledge of Christ as human, as the knowledge of Christ from the Gospel is also more excellent than that of the legal dispensation, by promises, prophecies, and the ceremonial law.
* &quot;For whom I have suffered the loss of all things&quot;: Paul dropped all confidence in his bodily privileges, civil, ceremonial, and moral righteousness, for Christ and his righteousness; losing his own good name and reputation among men, suffering many kinds of persecutions, losing the comforts of life, often in cold or nakedness, in hunger or thirst, even being ready to lose his own life for professing and preaching Christ.
*&quot;Count them as rubbish&quot; (KJV: &quot;dung&quot;): or &quot;dog&#x27;s meat&quot; (), what is only fit for dogs; that is, Paul treats as &quot;worthless&quot; his pedigree, religion sect, and moral righteousness before and after conversion; and everything material that he owns, same as what the early church held, considering its own righteousness as &quot;filthy rags&quot;.
*&quot;That I may gain Christ&quot;: not just get &quot;an interest in him&quot;, as this he knew he had already, and should never lose it, for it commenced from all eternity and cannot be obtained by good works, nor repentance, nor faith, but is freely given. Paul wishes that he might gain a larger knowledge of Christ, without care what pains he took, what expenses he was at, nor what loss he sustained or already suffered for what he regards precious, even willing to lose more, for more of this knowledge (cf. ), because then he gain more with Christ as a &quot;justifying righteousness&quot;: acceptance with God, pardon, life, peace, grace, and glory.

===Citizens of earth and heaven (3:17–4:1)===
Translator J. B. Phillips, commentator Robert Murray, the New Revised Standard Version and the Jerusalem Bible connect verse 1 with the final section of the previous chapter, as the conclusion of Paul&#x27;s main exhortations in chapters 2 and 3. Commentator Joseph Benson says &quot;certainly it should not have been separated&quot; from chapter 3. 

Paul argues that it is right to be good citizens, but &quot;our citizenship () is in heaven&quot;. The section calls on the Philippians to be co-imitators of himself; the Greek word (&quot;summimetai&quot;) is &quot;not elsewhere preserved&quot;.

==4:2-4:23==
In Chapter 4, Paul urges the Philippians to resolve conflicts within their fellowship. In the latter part of the chapter (Letter A), Paul expresses his gratitude for the gifts that the Philippians had sent him, and assures them that God will reward them for their generosity.

Throughout the epistle there is a sense of optimism. Paul is hopeful that he will be released, and on this basis he promises to send Timothy to the Philippians for ministry, and also expects to pay them a personal visit.

===Last appeal for harmony (4:2–3)===
Paul asks the two &quot;diakonoi&quot;, Euodia and Syntyche, female leaders of different house-groups in Philippi, &quot;to be of the same mind&quot; (to think, &quot;phronein&quot;, &quot;the same&quot;).

Verse 4:3 is translated:
:&quot;And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.&quot;
Paul addresses one of the leaders responsible for the church. Benson suggests he is probably addressing Silas, &quot;for Silas had been his yoke-fellow at the very place&quot;.

===Last call to joy, peace, and right thinking in Christ (4:4–9)===
According to Paul, the cure of the troubles in the church is to recall &quot;the charismatic joy of their first coming to faith&quot;, just as he told the Thessalonian church that &quot;in spite of persecutions you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit&quot; ().

===Paul&#x27;s attitude to gifts received and last greetings (4:10–23)===
Paul acknowledges the support from the church in Philippi, describing it as &quot;a sacrifice pleasing to God&quot;, and prays that God will take care of their needs, before closing the epistle with a mention of &quot;Caesar&#x27;s household&quot; (&quot;the emperor&#x27;s household&quot;) in verse 22, probably as a hint (cf. ) of the success Paul in obtaining Praetorian contacts.

Verse 4:13 is given in the New King James Version:
:&quot; I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.&quot;
The Greek word (&quot;Christō&quot;, &quot;Christ&quot;) is found in the majority of older manuscripts, but others lack explicit reference, so are rendered as &quot;him&quot;.

==Uses==
Portions of Philippians are used in various Christian lectionaries for regularly scheduled Bible readings.

&quot;Philippians 3:20-21&quot; is a song title in the album &quot;&quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;&quot; inspired by these verses that was released by the American band The Mountain Goats in 2009.

<doc id="9951" wikidata="Q131095" url="?curid=9951" title="Epistle to the Colossians">
<text>The Epistle to the Colossians is the twelfth book of the New Testament. It was written, according to the text, by Paul the Apostle and Timothy, and addressed to the church in Colossae, a small Phrygian city near Laodicea and approximately from Ephesus in Asia Minor.

Scholars have increasingly questioned Paul&#x27;s authorship and attributed the letter to an early follower instead, but others still defend it as authentic. If Paul was the author, he probably used an amanuensis, or secretary, in writing the letter (Col 4:18), possibly Timothy.

The original text was written in Koine Greek.

==Composition==
During the first generation after Jesus, Paul&#x27;s epistles to various churches helped establish early Christian theology. According to Bruce Metzger, it was written in the 60s while Paul was in prison. Colossians is similar to Ephesians, also written at this time. Some critical scholars have ascribed the epistle to an early follower of Paul, writing as Paul. The epistle&#x27;s description of Christ as pre-eminent over creation marks it, for some scholars, as representing an advanced christology not present during Paul&#x27;s lifetime. Defenders of Pauline authorship cite the work&#x27;s similarities to the letter to Philemon, which is broadly accepted as authentic.

=== Authorship ===

The letter&#x27;s authors claim to be Paul and Timothy, but authorship began to be authoritatively questioned during the 19th century. Pauline authorship was held to by many of the early church&#x27;s prominent theologians, such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen of Alexandria and Eusebius.

However, as with several epistles attributed to Paul, critical scholarship disputes this claim. One ground is that the epistle&#x27;s language doesn&#x27;t seem to match Paul&#x27;s, with 48 words appearing in Colossians that are found nowhere else in his writings and 33 of which occur nowhere else in the New Testament. A second ground is that the epistle features a strong use of liturgical-hymnic style which appears nowhere else in Paul&#x27;s work to the same extent. A third is that the epistle&#x27;s themes related to Christ, eschatology and the church seem to have no parallel in Paul&#x27;s undisputed works.

Advocates of Pauline authorship defend the differences that there are between elements in this letter and those commonly considered the genuine work of Paul (e.g. 1 Thessalonians). It is argued that these differences can come by human variability, such as by growth in theological knowledge over time, different occasion for writing, as well as use of different secretaries (or amanuenses) in composition. As it is usually pointed out by the same authors who note the differences in language and style, the number of words foreign to the New Testament and Paul is no greater in Colossians than in the undisputed Pauline letters (Galatians, of similar length, has 35 hapax legomena). In regard to the style, as Norman Perrin, who argues for pseudonymity, notes, &quot;The letter does employ a great deal of traditional material and it can be argued that this accounts for the non-Pauline language and style. If this is the case, the non-Pauline language and style are not indications of pseudonymity.&quot; Not only that, but it has been noted that Colossians has indisputably Pauline stylistic characteristics, found nowhere else in the New Testament. Advocates of Pauline authorship also argue that the differences between Colossians and the rest of the New Testament are not as great as they are purported to be.

As theologian Stephen D. Morrison points out in context, &quot;Biblical scholars are divided over the authorship of Ephesians and Colossians.&quot; He provides as an example the reflection of theologian Karl Barth on the question. While acknowledging the validity of many questions regarding Pauline authorship, Barth was inclined to defend it. Nevertheless, he concluded that it didn&#x27;t much matter one way or the other to him. It was more important to focus on &quot;Quid scriptum est&quot; (What is written) than &quot;Quis scripseris&quot; (Who wrote it). &quot;It is enough to know that someone, at any rate, wrote Ephesians (why not Paul?), 30 to 60 years after Christ’s death (hardly any later than that, since it is attested by Ignatius, Polycarp, and Justin), someone who understood Paul well and developed the apostle’s ideas with conspicuous loyalty as well as originality.”

===Date===
If the text was written by Paul, it could have been written at Rome during his first imprisonment. Paul would likely have composed it at roughly the same time that he wrote Philemon and Ephesians, as all three letters were sent with Tychicus and Onesimus. A date of 62 AD assumes that the imprisonment Paul speaks of is his Roman imprisonment that followed his voyage to Rome.

Other scholars have suggested that it was written from Caesarea or Ephesus.

If the letter is not considered to be an authentic part of the Pauline corpus, then it might be dated during the late 1st century, possibly as late as AD 90.

==Surviving manuscripts==

The original manuscript is lost, as are many early copies. The text of surviving copies varies. The oldest manuscripts transcribing some or all of this letter include:

*Papyrus 46 (c. AD 200)
*Codex Vaticanus (325–350)
*Codex Sinaiticus (330–360)
*Codex Alexandrinus (400–440)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450)
*Codex Freerianus (c. 450)
*Codex Claromontanus (c. 550; in Greek and Latin)
*Codex Coislinianus (c. 550)

== Content ==

Colossae is in the same region as the seven churches of the Book of Revelation. In Colossians there is mention of local brethren in Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis. Colossae was approximately from Laodicea and from Hierapolis.

References to &quot;the elements&quot; and the only mention of the word &quot;philosophy&quot; in the New Testament have led scholar Norman DeWitt to conclude that early Christians at Colossae must have been under the influence of Epicurean philosophy, which taught atomism. The Epistle to the Colossians proclaimed Christ to be the supreme power over the entire universe, and urged Christians to lead godly lives. The letter consists of two parts: first a doctrinal section, then a second regarding conduct. Those who believe that the motivation of the letter was a growing heresy in the church see both sections of the letter as opposing false teachers who have been spreading error in the congregation. Others see both sections of the letter as primarily encouragement and edification for a developing church.

===Doctrinal sections===
The doctrinal part of the letter is found in the first two chapters. The main theme is developed in chapter 2, with a warning against being drawn away from him in whom dwelt all the fullness of the deity, and who was the head of all spiritual powers. offers firstly a &quot;general warning&quot; against accepting a purely human philosophy, and then a &quot;more specific warning against false teachers&quot;.

In these doctrinal sections, the letter proclaims that Christ is supreme over all that has been created. All things were created through him and for him, and the universe is sustained by him. God had chosen for his complete being to dwell in Christ. The &quot;cosmic powers&quot; revered by the false teachers had been &quot;discarded&quot; and &quot;led captive&quot; at Christ&#x27;s death. Christ is the master of all angelic forces and the head of the church. Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity, the unique agent of cosmic reconciliation. It is the Father in Colossians who is said to have delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son. The Son is the agent of reconciliation and salvation not merely of the church, but in some sense redeems the rest of creation as well (&quot;all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven&quot;).

=== Conduct ===
The practical part of the Epistle, enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above Colossians 3:1–4, to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man. Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character. The letter ends with customary prayer, instruction, and greetings.

Colossians 3:22-24 instructs slaves to obey their masters and serve them sincerely, in return for an &quot;inheritance&quot; from God in the afterlife. Colossians 4:1 instructs masters to &quot;provide your slaves with what is right and fair&quot; because God is in turn their master.

=== The prison epistles ===
Colossians is often categorized as one of the &quot;prison epistles&quot;, along with Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. Colossians has some close parallels with the letter to Philemon: names of some of the same people (e.g., Timothy, Aristarchus, Archippus, Mark, Epaphras, Luke, Onesimus, and Demas) appear in both epistles, and both are claimed to be written by Paul.

<doc id="9952" wikidata="Q131115" url="?curid=9952" title="First Epistle to the Thessalonians">
<text>The First Epistle to the Thessalonians is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle, and is addressed to the church in Thessalonica, in modern-day Greece. It is likely among the first of Paul&#x27;s letters, probably written by the end of AD 52, in the reign of Claudius although some scholars believe the Epistle to the Galatians may have been written by AD 48. The original language is Koine Greek.

==Background and audience==

Thessalonica is a city on the Thermaic Gulf, which at the time of Paul was within the Roman Empire. Paul visited Thessalonica and preached to the local population, winning converts who became a Christian community. There is debate as to whether or not Paul&#x27;s converts were originally Jewish. The Acts of the Apostles describes Paul preaching in a Jewish synagogue and persuading people who were already Jewish that Jesus was the Messiah, but in 1 Thessalonians itself Paul says that the converts had turned from idols, suggesting that they were not Jewish before Paul arrived.

Most New Testament scholars believe Paul wrote this letter from Corinth only months after he left Thessalonica, although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e.g., Codices Alexandrinus, Mosquensis, and Angelicus) state that Paul wrote it in Athens after Timothy had returned from Macedonia with news of the state of the church in Thessalonica.

==Oldest surviving manuscripts==

The original manuscript of this letter is lost, as are over a century of copies. The text of the surviving manuscripts varies. The oldest surviving manuscripts that contain some or all of this book include:
* Papyrus 46 (c. AD 200)
* Papyrus 65 (3rd century)
* Codex Vaticanus (325–350)
* Codex Sinaiticus (330–360)
* Codex Alexandrinus (400–440)
* Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450)
* Codex Freerianus (c. 450)
* Codex Claromontanus (c. 550)

==Composition==

===Date===
It is widely agreed that 1 Thessalonians is one of the first books of the New Testament to be written, and the earliest extant Christian text. A majority of modern New Testament scholars date 1 Thessalonians to 49–51 AD, during Paul&#x27;s 18-month stay in Corinth coinciding with his second missionary journey. A minority of scholars who do not recognize the historicity of Acts date it in the early 40s AD. The Delphi Inscription dates Gallio&#x27;s proconsulship of Achaia to 51-52 AD, and Acts 18:12-17 mentions Gallio, toward the end of Paul&#x27;s stay in Corinth.

1 Thessalonians does not focus on justification by faith or questions of Jewish–Gentile relations, themes that are covered in all other letters. Because of this, some scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul&#x27;s positions on these matters were formed and elucidated.

===Authenticity===

The majority of New Testament scholars hold 1 Thessalonians to be authentic, although a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its authenticity, most notably Clement Schrader and F.C. Baur. 1 Thessalonians matches other accepted Pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its authorship is also affirmed by 2 Thessalonians.

===Integrity===

The authenticity of 1 Thessalonians 2:13–16 has been disputed by some. The following arguments are made against its authenticity based on its content:
* It is perceived to be theologically incompatible with Paul&#x27;s other epistles: elsewhere Paul attributed Jesus&#x27;s death to the &quot;rulers of this age&quot; rather than to the Jews, and elsewhere Paul writes that the Jews have not been abandoned by God, for &quot;all Israel will be saved&quot;.
* There were no extensive historical persecutions of Christians by Jews in Palestine prior to the first Jewish war.
* The use of the concept of imitation in 1 Thes. 2.14 is singular.
* The aorist ἔφθασε[ν] (&quot;has overtaken&quot;) in 1 Thes. 2.16 seems to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. According to 1 Thes 1:10, the wrath of God is still to come; it is not something that has already shown itself.
* The syntax of these verses deviates from that of the surrounding context.

Various scholars have since defended the authenticity of these passages.

It is also sometimes suggested that 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11 is a post-Pauline insertion that has many features of Lukan language and theology that serves as an apologetic correction to Paul&#x27;s imminent expectation of the Second Coming in 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18. Some scholars, such as Schmithals, Eckhart, Demke and Munro, have developed complicated theories involving redaction and interpolation in 1 and 2 Thessalonians.

===Text===
Paul, speaking for himself, Silas, and Timothy, gives thanks for the news about their faith and love; he reminds them of the kind of life he had lived while he was with them. Paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself, reminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an apostle to impose upon them.

Paul goes on to explain that the dead will be resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord in the air.

<doc id="9953" wikidata="Q131493" url="?curid=9953" title="Epistle to Titus">
<text>The Epistle to Titus is one of the three pastoral epistles (along with 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy) in the New Testament, historically attributed to Paul the Apostle. It is addressed to Saint Titus and describes the requirements and duties of presbyters/bishops.

==Text==
The epistle is divided into three chapters, 46 verses in total.

==Recipient==
Not mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Titus was noted in Galatians (cf. Galatians 2:1, 3) where Paul wrote of journeying to Jerusalem with Barnabas, accompanied by Titus. He was then dispatched to Corinth, Greece, where he successfully reconciled the Christian community there with Paul, its founder. Titus was later left on the island of Crete to help organize the Church there, and later met back with the Apostle Paul in Nicopolis. He soon went to Dalmatia (now Croatia). According to Eusebius of Caesarea in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, he served as the first bishop of Crete. He was buried in Cortyna (Gortyna), Crete; his head was later removed to Venice during the invasion of Crete by the Saracens in 832 and was enshrined in St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice, Italy.

==Authenticity==

According to Clare Drury, the claim that Paul himself wrote this letter and those to Timothy &quot;seems at first sight obvious and incontrovertible. All three
begin with a greeting from the apostle and contain personal notes and asides&quot;, but in reality &quot;things are not so straightforward: signs of the late
date of the letters proliferate&quot;. There has therefore been some debate regarding the authenticity of the letter.

===Opposition to Pauline authenticity===
Titus, along with the two other pastoral epistles (1 Timothy and 2 Timothy), is regarded by some scholars as being pseudepigraphical. On the basis of the language and content of the pastoral epistles, these scholars reject that they were written by Paul and believe that they were written by an anonymous forger after his death. Critics claim the vocabulary and style of the Pauline letters could not have been written by Paul according to available biographical information and reflect the views of the emerging Church rather than the apostle&#x27;s. These scholars date the epistle from the 80s CE up to the end of the 2nd century, though most would place it sometime between 80 and 100 CE. The Church of England&#x27;s Common Worship Lectionary Scripture Commentary concurs with this view: &quot;the proportioning of the theological and practical themes is one factor that leads us to think of these writings as coming from the post-Pauline church world of the late first or early second century&quot;.

Titus has a very close affinity with 1 Timothy, sharing similar phrases and expressions and similar subject matter. This has led many scholars to believe that it was written by the same author who wrote 1 and 2 Timothy: their author is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Pastor&quot;.

The gnostic writer Basilides rejected the epistle.

===Traditional view: Pauline authenticity===
Other scholars who do believe that Paul wrote Titus date its composition from the circumstance that it was written after Paul&#x27;s visit to Crete (Titus 1:5). This visit could not be the one referred to in the Acts of the Apostles 27:7, when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. Thus traditional exegesis supposes that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia, passing Crete by the way, and that there he left Titus &quot;to set in order the things that were wanting&quot;. Thence he would have gone to Ephesus, where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he wrote the First Epistle to Timothy, and thence, according to the subscription of this epistle, to &quot;Nicopolis of Macedonia&quot;, from which place he wrote to Titus, about 66 or 67.

Recent scholarship has revived the theory that Paul used an amanuensis, or secretaries, in writing his letters (e.g. Romans 16:22), but possibly Luke for the pastorals. This was a common practice in ancient letter writing, even for the biblical writers.

==Epimenides paradox==
One of the secular peculiarities of the Epistle to Titus is the reference to the Epimenides paradox: &quot;One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, &#x27;Cretans are always liars&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="9954" wikidata="Q276" url="?curid=9954" title="Eurovision Song Contest">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest (), often known simply as Eurovision, is an international song competition organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union. Each participating country submits an original song to be performed live and transmitted to national broadcasters via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks, with competing countries then casting votes for the other countries&#x27; songs to determine a winner.

The contest was inspired by and based on Italy&#x27;s national Sanremo Music Festival, held in the Italian Riviera since 1951. Eurovision has been held annually since 1956 (except for due to the COVID-19 restrictions), making it the longest-running international music competition on television and one of the world&#x27;s longest-running television programmes. Active members of the EBU and invited associate members are eligible to compete; 52 countries have participated at least once. Each participating broadcaster sends an original song of three minutes duration or less to be performed live by a singer or group of up to six people aged 16 or older. Each country awards 1–8, 10 and 12 points to their ten favourite songs, based on the views of an assembled group of music professionals and the country&#x27;s viewing public, with the song receiving the most points declared the winner. Other performances feature alongside the competition, including a specially-commissioned opening and interval act and guest performances by musicians and other personalities, with past acts including Cirque du Soleil, Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Mika, Rita Ora and the first performance of &quot;Riverdance&quot;. Originally consisting of a single evening event, the contest has expanded as new countries joined (including countries outside of Europe, such as and ), leading to the introduction of relegation procedures in the 1990s, before the creation of semi-finals in the 2000s. has competed more times than any other country, having participated in all but one edition, while and both hold the record for the most victories, with seven wins each in total.

Traditionally held in the country that won the preceding year&#x27;s event, the contest provides an opportunity to promote the host country and city as a tourist destination. Thousands of spectators attend each year, along with journalists who cover all aspects of the contest, including rehearsals in venue, press conferences with the competing acts, in addition to other related events and performances in the host city. Alongside the generic Eurovision logo, a unique theme is typically developed for each event. The contest has aired in countries across all continents; it has been available online via the official Eurovision website since 2001. Eurovision ranks among the world&#x27;s most watched non-sporting events every year, with hundreds of millions of viewers globally. Performing at the contest has often provided artists with a local career boost and in some cases long-lasting international success. Several of the best-selling music artists in the world have competed in past editions, including ABBA, Celine Dion, Julio Iglesias, Cliff Richard and Olivia Newton-John; some of the world&#x27;s best-selling singles have received their first international performance on the Eurovision stage.

While having gained popularity with the viewing public in both participating and non-participating countries, the contest has also been the subject of criticism for its artistic quality as well as a perceived political aspect to the event. Concerns have been raised regarding political friendships and rivalries between countries potentially having an impact on the results. Controversial moments have included participating countries withdrawing at a late stage, censorship of broadcast segments by broadcasters, as well as political events impacting participation. The contest has also been criticised for an over-abundance of elaborate stage shows at the cost of artistic merit. Eurovision has, however, gained popularity for its camp appeal, its musical span of ethnic and international styles, as well as emergence as part of LGBT culture, resulting in a large, active fanbase and an influence on popular culture. The popularity of the contest has led to the creation of several similar events, either organised by the EBU or created by external organisations; several special events have been organised by the EBU to celebrate select anniversaries or as a replacement due to cancellation.

== Origins and history ==
The Eurovision Song Contest was developed by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as an experiment in live television broadcasting and a way to produce cheaper programming for national broadcasting organisations. The word &quot;Eurovision&quot; was first used by British journalist George Campey in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; in 1951, when he referred to a BBC programme being relayed by Dutch television. Following several events broadcast internationally via the Eurovision transmission network in the early 1950s, including the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, an EBU committee, headed by Marcel Bezençon, was formed in January 1955 to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters, which approved for further study a European song competition from an idea initially proposed by RAI manager Sergio Pugliese. The EBU&#x27;s general assembly agreed to the organising of the song contest in October 1955, under the initial title of the &quot;European Grand Prix&quot;, and accepted a proposal by the Swiss delegation to host the event in Lugano in the spring of 1956. The Italian Sanremo Music Festival, held since 1951, was used as a basis for the initial planning of the contest, with several amendments and additions given its international nature.

Seven countries participated in the , with each country represented by two songs; the only time in which multiple entries per country were permitted. The winning song was &quot;Refrain&quot;, representing the host country Switzerland and performed by Lys Assia. Voting during the first contest was held behind closed doors, with only the winner being announced on stage; the use of a scoreboard and public announcement of the voting, inspired by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs&quot;, began in 1957. The tradition of the winning country hosting the following year&#x27;s contest, which has since become a standard feature of the event, began in 1958. Technological developments have transformed the contest: colour broadcasts began in ; satellite broadcasts in ; and streaming in . Broadcasts in widescreen began in 2005 and in high-definition since 2007, with ultra-high-definition tested for the first time in 2022.

By the 1960s, between 16 and 18 countries were regularly competing each year. Countries from outside the traditional boundaries of Europe began entering the contest, and countries in Western Asia and North Africa started competing in the 1970s and 1980s. Apart from Yugoslavia (a member of the non-aligned movement and not seen as part of the Eastern Bloc at the time) no socialist or communist country ever participated. However, the Intervision Song Contest which held four editions in the 1970s and 1980s (and a one-off revival in 2008) saw the participation of NATO and EEC members – including some from outside Europe like Canada – in addition to the Eastern Bloc countries of Intervision that had set up the contest. Only after the end of the Cold War did other countries from Central and Eastern Europe participate for the first time – some of those countries having gained or regained their independence in the course of the breakup of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union. As a consequence, more countries were now applying than could feasibly participate in a one-night-event of reasonable length. Numerous solutions to this problem were tried out over the years. The included a contest called Kvalifikacija za Millstreet which was a pre-qualifying round for seven of these new countries, and from , relegation systems were introduced to manage the number of competing entries, with the poorest performing countries barred from entering the following year&#x27;s contest. From 2004, the contest expanded to become a multi-programme event, with a semi-final at the allowing all interested countries to compete each year; a second semi-final was added to each edition from 2008.

There have been 68 contests making Eurovision the longest-running annual international televised music competition as determined by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The contest has been listed as one of the longest-running television programmes in the world and among the world&#x27;s most watched non-sporting events. A total of 52 countries have taken part in at least one edition, with a record 43 countries participating in a single contest, first in and subsequently in and . Australia became the first non-EBU member country to compete following an invitation by the EBU ahead of the contest&#x27;s in 2015; initially announced as a &quot;one-off&quot; for the anniversary edition, the country was invited back the following year and has subsequently participated every year since.

Eurovision had been held every year until 2020, when was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. No competitive event was able to take place due to uncertainty caused by the spread of the virus in Europe and the various restrictions imposed by the governments of the participating countries. In its place a special broadcast, &quot;&quot;, was produced by the organisers, which honoured the songs and artists that would have competed in 2020 in a non-competitive format.

=== Naming ===
The contest has been known by different names in various languages. The first contest was officially named the in Italian, the in French, and the &quot;Grand Prix of the Eurovision Song Competition&quot; in English, Similar variations, such as in Swedish or in Dutch, were unofficially used in some editions. The names &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; and in French became a standard in subsequent decades. The contest was briefly rebranded as &quot;Eurosong&quot; in English for the , but this was reverted the following year. The names were not standardised until 2004, when the contest was rebranded. The official brand guidelines specify that translations of the name may be used depending on national tradition and brand recognition in the competing countries, but that the official name &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; is always preferred.

On only four occasions has the name used for the official logo of the contest not been in English or French: the Italian names and were used when Italy hosted the and contests respectively; and the Dutch name was used when the Netherlands hosted in and .

== Format ==
Original songs representing participating countries are performed in a live television programme broadcast via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks simultaneously to all countries. A &quot;country&quot; as a participant is represented by one television broadcaster from that country, a member of the European Broadcasting Union, and is typically that country&#x27;s national public broadcasting organisation. The programme is staged by one of the participant countries and is broadcast from an auditorium in the selected host city. Since 2008, each contest is typically formed of three live television shows held over one week: two semi-finals are held on the Tuesday and Thursday, followed by a final on the Saturday. All participating countries compete in one of the two semi-finals, except for the host country of that year&#x27;s contest and the contest&#x27;s biggest financial contributors known as the &quot;Big Five&quot;—, , , and the . The remaining countries are split between the two semi-finals, and the 10 highest-scoring entries in each qualify to produce 26 countries competing in the final. Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, and are the only countries outside of the &quot;Big Five&quot; to have qualified for the final of every contest they have competed in.

Each participating broadcaster has sole discretion over the process it may employ to select its entry for the contest. Typical methods in which participants are selected include a televised national final using a jury and/or public vote; an internal selection by a committee appointed by the broadcaster; and a mixed format where some decisions are made internally and the public are engaged in others. Among the most successful televised selection shows is Sweden&#x27;s , first established in 1959 and now one of Sweden&#x27;s most watched television shows each year.
Each show typically begins with an opening act consisting of music and/or dance performances by invited artists, which contributes to a unique theme and identity created for that year&#x27;s event; since 2013, the opening of the contest&#x27;s final has included a &quot;Flag Parade&quot;, with competing artists entering the stage behind their country&#x27;s flag in a similar manner to the procession of competing athletes at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Viewers are welcomed by one or more presenters who provide key updates during the show, conduct interviews with competing acts from the green room, and guide the voting procedure in English and French. Competing acts perform sequentially, and after all songs have been performed, viewers are invited to vote for their favourite performances—except for the performance of their own country—via telephone, SMS and the official Eurovision app. The public vote comprises 50% of the final result alongside the views of a jury of music industry professionals from each country. An interval act is invariably featured during this voting period, which on several occasions has included a well-known personality from the host country or an internationally recognised figure. The results of the voting are subsequently announced; in the semi-finals, the 10 highest-ranked countries are announced in a random order, with the full results undisclosed until after the final. In the final, the presenters call upon a representative spokesperson for each country in turn who announces their jury&#x27;s points, while the results of the public vote are subsequently announced by the presenters. In recent years, it has been tradition that the first country to announce its jury points is the previous host, whereas the last country is the current host (with the exception of , when the United Kingdom hosted the contest on behalf of Ukraine, which went first). The qualifying acts in the semi-finals, and the winning delegation in the final are invited back on stage; in the final, a trophy is awarded to the winning performers and songwriters by the previous year&#x27;s winner, followed by a reprise of the winning song. The full results of the competition, including detailed results of the jury and public vote, are released online shortly after the final, and the participating broadcaster of the winning entry is traditionally given the honour of organising the following year&#x27;s event.

== Participation ==

Active members (as opposed to associate members) of the European Broadcasting Union are eligible to participate; active members are those who are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe. Active members include media organisations whose broadcasts are often made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions. Associate member broadcasters may be eligible to compete, dependent on approval by the contest&#x27;s reference group.

The European Broadcasting Area is defined by the International Telecommunication Union as encompassing the geographical area between the boundary of ITU Region 1 in the west, the meridian 40° East of Greenwich in the east, and parallel 30° North in the south. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and the parts of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Ukraine lying outside these limits are also included in the European Broadcasting Area.

Eligibility to participate in the contest is therefore not limited to countries in Europe, as several states geographically outside the boundaries of the continent or which span more than one continent are included in the Broadcasting Area. Countries from these groups have taken part in past editions, including countries in Western Asia such as Israel and Cyprus, countries which span Europe and Asia like Russia and Turkey, and North African countries such as Morocco. Australia became the first country to participate from outside the European Broadcasting Area in 2015, following an invitation by the contest&#x27;s reference group.

EBU members who wish to participate must fulfil conditions as laid down in the rules of the contest, a separate copy of which is drafted annually. A maximum of 44 countries can take part in any one contest. Broadcasters must have paid the EBU a participation fee in advance of the deadline specified in the rules for the year in which they wish to participate; this fee is different for each country based on its size and viewership.

Fifty-two countries have participated at least once. These are listed here alongside the year in which they made their debut:

== Hosting ==
The winning country traditionally hosts the following year&#x27;s event, with some exceptions since . Hosting the contest can be seen as a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination and can provide benefits to the local economy and tourism sectors of the host city. However, there is a perception reflected in popular culture that some countries wish to avoid the costly burden of hostingsometimes resulting in them sending deliberately subpar entries with no chance of winning. This belief is mentioned in &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot; (2020) and a plot point in the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; (1996). Preparations for each year&#x27;s contest typically begin at the conclusion of the previous year&#x27;s contest, with the winning country&#x27;s head of delegation receiving a welcome package of information related to hosting the contest at the winner&#x27;s press conference. Eurovision is a non-profit event, and financing is typically achieved through a fee from each participating broadcaster, contributions from the host broadcaster and the host city, and commercial revenues from sponsorships, ticket sales, televoting and merchandise.

The host broadcaster will subsequently select a host city, typically a national or regional capital city, which must meet certain criteria set out in the contest&#x27;s rules. The host venue must be able to accommodate at least 10,000 spectators, a press centre for 1,500 journalists, should be within easy reach of an international airport and with hotel accommodation available for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators. A variety of different venues have been used for past editions, from small theatres and television studios to large arenas and stadiums. The largest host venue is Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, which was attended by almost 38,000 spectators in . With a population of 1,500 at the time of the , Millstreet, Ireland remains the smallest hosting settlement, although its Green Glens Arena is capable of hosting up to 8,000 spectators.

Unlike the Olympic Games or FIFA World Cup, whose host venues are announced several years in advance, there is usually no purpose-built infrastructure whose construction is justified with the needs of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest. However, the , hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, was held at Baku Crystal Hall, a venue that had not existed when Azerbaijan won the previous year. Most other editions have been held in pre-existing venues, but renovations or modifications have sometimes been undertaken in the year prior to the contest which are justified with the needs of Eurovision.

=== Eurovision logo and theme ===
Until 2004, each edition of the contest used its own logo and visual identity as determined by the respective host broadcaster. To create a consistent visual identity, a generic logo was introduced ahead of the . This is typically accompanied by a unique theme artwork designed for each individual contest by the host broadcaster, with the flag of the host country placed prominently in the centre of the Eurovision heart. The original logo was designed by the London-based agency JM International, and received a revamp in 2014 by the Amsterdam-based Cityzen Agency for the contest&#x27;s .

An individual theme is utilised by contest producers when constructing the visual identity of each edition of the contest, including the stage design, the opening and interval acts, and the &quot;postcards&quot;. The short video postcards are interspersed between the entries and were first introduced in 1970, initially as an attempt to &quot;bulk up&quot; the contest after a number of countries decided not to compete, but has since become a regular part of the show and usually highlight the host country and introduce the competing acts. A unique slogan for each edition, first introduced in , was also an integral part of each contest&#x27;s visual identity, which was replaced by a permanent slogan from onwards. The permanent slogan, &quot;United by Music&quot;, had previously served as the slogan for the before being retained for all future editions as part of the contest&#x27;s global brand strategy.

=== Preparations ===
Preparations in the host venue typically begin approximately six weeks before the final, to accommodate building works and technical rehearsals before the arrival of the competing artists. Delegations will typically arrive in the host city two to three weeks before the live show, and each participating broadcaster nominates a head of delegation, responsible for coordinating the movements of their delegation and being that country&#x27;s representative to the EBU. Members of each country&#x27;s delegation include performers, composers, lyricists, members of the press, and—in the years where a live orchestra was present—a conductor. Present if desired is a commentator, who provides commentary of the event for their country&#x27;s radio and/or television feed in their country&#x27;s own language in dedicated booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.

Each country conducts two individual rehearsals behind closed doors, the first for 30 minutes and the second for 20 minutes. Individual rehearsals for the semi-finalists commence the week before the live shows, with countries typically rehearsing in the order in which they will perform during the contest; rehearsals for the host country and the &quot;Big Five&quot; automatic finalists are held towards the end of the week. Following rehearsals, delegations meet with the show&#x27;s production team to review footage of the rehearsal and raise any special requirements or changes. &quot;Meet and greet&quot; sessions with accredited fans and press are held during these rehearsal weeks. Each live show is preceded by three dress rehearsals, where the whole show is run in the same way as it will be presented on TV. The second dress rehearsal, alternatively called the &quot;jury show&quot; or &quot;evening preview show&quot; and held the night before the broadcast, is used as a recorded back-up in case of technological failure, and performances during this show are used by each country&#x27;s professional jury to determine their votes. The delegations from the qualifying countries in each semi-final attend a qualifiers&#x27; press conference after their respective semi-final, and the winning delegation attends a winners&#x27; press conference following the final.

A welcome reception is typically held at a venue in the host city on the Sunday preceding the live shows, which includes a red carpet ceremony for all the participating countries and is usually broadcast online. Accredited delegates, press and fans have access to an official nightclub, the &quot;EuroClub&quot;, and some delegations will hold their own parties. The &quot;Eurovision Village&quot; is an official fan zone open to the public free of charge, with live performances by the contest&#x27;s artists and screenings of the live shows on big screens.

== Rules ==

The contest is organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), together with the participating broadcaster of the host country. The event is monitored by an executive supervisor appointed by the EBU, and by the Reference Group which represents all participating broadcasters, who are each represented by a nominated head of delegation. The current executive supervisor is Martin Österdahl, who took over the role from Jon Ola Sand in May 2020. A detailed set of rules is written by the EBU for each contest and approved by the reference group. These rules have changed over time, and typically outline, among other points, the eligibility of the competing songs, the format of the contest, and the voting system to be used to determine the winner and how the results will be presented.

=== Song eligibility and languages ===
All competing songs must have a duration of three minutes or less. This rule applies only to the version performed during the live shows. In order to be considered eligible, competing songs in a given year&#x27;s contest must not have been released commercially before the first day of September of the previous year. All competing entries must include vocals and lyrics of some kind; a cappella songs and purely instrumental pieces are not allowed. Competing entries may be performed in any language, be that natural or constructed, and participating broadcasters are free to decide the language in which their entry may be performed.

Rules specifying in which language a song may be performed have changed over time. No restrictions were originally enacted when the contest was first founded; however, following criticism over the being performed in English, a new rule was introduced for the restricting songs to be performed only in an official language of the country it represented. This rule was first abolished in , and subsequently reinstated for most countries in , with only and permitted freedom of language as their selection processes for that year&#x27;s contest had already commenced. The language rule was once again abolished ahead of the .

There is no restriction on the national origin, country of residence or age of the songwriter(s). Furthermore, unlike performers who may only represent one country in any given year, songwriters are free to enter multiple songs in a single year sung by different acts. For example, in the 1980 edition, both Germany&#x27;s and Luxembourg&#x27;s entry were (co-)written by Ralph Siegel, who – in a career spanning over 40 years – was involved in some form in the writing of dozens of entries — both advancing to the final and failing to make it past the national selection, including the winning entry in 1982.

=== Artist eligibility and performances ===
The rules for the first contest specified that only solo performers were permitted to enter; this criterion was changed the following year to permit duos to compete, and groups were subsequently permitted for the first time in . Currently the number of people permitted on stage during competing performances is limited to a maximum of six, and no live animals are allowed. Since , all contestants must be aged 16 or over on the day of the live show in which they perform. Sandra Kim, the winner in at the age of 13, shall remain the contest&#x27;s youngest winner while this rule remains in place. There is no limit on the nationality or country of birth of the competing artists, and participating broadcasters are free to select an artist from any country; several winning artists have subsequently held a different nationality or were born in a different country to that which they represented. No performer may compete for more than one country in a given year. There is no restriction regarding performers who have participated in past events competing again – whether for the same country or a different one. It is even possible for a winning performer to try and defend their title in the next edition, as happened when 2010 winner Lena competed again in 2011. However, in the history of the contest only two individuals have won more than once as a performerJohnny Logan in 1980 and 1987 for Ireland, and Loreen in 2012 and 2023 for Sweden.

The orchestra was a prominent aspect of the contest from 1956 to 1998. Pre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed for competing acts in 1973, but any pre-recorded instruments were required to be seen being &quot;performed&quot; on stage. In 1997, all instrumental music was allowed to be pre-recorded, although the host country was still required to provide an orchestra. In 1999, the rules were changed again, making the orchestra an optional requirement; the host broadcaster of , Israel&#x27;s IBA, subsequently decided not to provide an orchestra, resulting in all entries using backing tracks for the first time. Since then all instrumental music for competing entries has been pre-recorded.

The main vocals of competing songs must be performed live during the contest. Previously live backing vocals were also required; since these may optionally be pre-recordedthis change has been implemented in an effort to introduce flexibility following the cancellation of the 2020 edition and to facilitate modernisation.

=== Running order ===
Since , the order in which the competing countries perform has been determined by the contest&#x27;s producers, and submitted to the executive supervisor and reference group for approval before public announcement. This was changed from a random draw used in previous years in order to provide a better experience for television viewers and ensure all countries stand out by avoiding instances where songs of a similar style or tempo are performed in sequence.

Since the creation of a second semi-final in , a semi-final allocation draw is held each year. Countries are placed into pots based on their geographical location and voting history in recent contests, and are assigned to compete in one of the two semi-finals through a random draw. Countries are then randomly assigned to compete in either the first or second half of their respective semi-final, and once all competing songs have been selected the producers then determine the running order for the semi-finals. The automatic qualifiers are assigned at random to a semi-final for the purposes of voting rights.

Semi-final qualifiers make a draw at random during the qualifiers&#x27; press conference to determine whether they will perform during the first, second half, or a producer-determined position in the final, while the automatic finalists randomly draw their competing half or producer-determined position in the run-up to the final, except for the host country, whose exact performance position is determined in a separate draw. The running order for the final is then decided following the second semi-final by the producers. The running orders are decided with the competing songs&#x27; musical qualities, stage performance, prop and lighting set-up, and other production considerations taken into account.

=== Voting ===

Since 2023, the voting system used to determine the results of the contest has worked on the basis of positional voting. Each country awards 1–8, 10 and 12 points to the ten favourite songs as voted for by that country&#x27;s general public or assembled jury, with the most preferred song receiving 12 points. In the semi-finals, each country awards one set of points, based primarily on the votes cast by that country&#x27;s viewing public via telephone, SMS or the official Eurovision app, while in the final, each country awards two sets of points, with one set awarded by the viewers and another awarded by a jury panel comprising five music professionals from that country. Since 2023, viewers in non-participating countries have also been able to vote during the contest, with those viewers able to cast votes via an online platform, which are then aggregated and awarded as one set of points from an &quot;extra country&quot; for the overall public vote. This system is a modification of that used since 1975, when the &quot;12 points&quot; system was first introduced but with one set of points per country, and a similar system used since 2016 where two sets of points were awarded in both the semi-finals and final. National juries and the public in each country are not allowed to vote for their own country, a rule first introduced in 1957.

Historically, each country&#x27;s points were determined by a jury, consisting at various times of members of the public, music professionals, or both in combination. With advances in telecommunication technology, televoting was first introduced to the contest in on a trial basis, with broadcasters in five countries allowing the viewing public to determine their votes for the first time. From , televoting was extended to almost all competing countries, and subsequently became mandatory from . A jury was reintroduced for the final in , with each country&#x27;s points comprising both the votes of the jury and public in an equal split; this mix of jury and public voting was expanded into the semi-finals from 2010, and was used until 2023, when full public voting was reintroduced to determine the results of the semi-finals. The mix of jury and public voting continues to be used in the final.

Should two or more countries finish with the same number of points, a tie-break procedure is employed to determine the final placings. a combined national televoting and jury result is calculated for each country, and the country which has obtained more points from the public voting following this calculation is deemed to have placed higher.

==== Presentation of the votes ====
Since 1957, each country&#x27;s votes have been announced during a special voting segment as part of the contest&#x27;s broadcast, with a selected spokesperson assigned to announce the results of their country&#x27;s vote. This spokesperson is typically well known in their country; previous spokespersons have included former Eurovision artists and presenters. Historically, the announcements were made through telephone lines from the countries of origin, with satellite links employed for the first time in , allowing the spokespersons to be seen visually by the audience and TV spectators.

Scoring is done by both a national jury and a national televote. Each country&#x27;s jury votes are consecutively added to the totals scoreboard as they are called upon by the contest presenter(s). The scoreboard was historically placed at the side of the stage and updated manually as each country gave their votes; in a computer graphics scoreboard was introduced. The jury points from 1–8 and 10 are displayed on screen and added automatically to the scoreboard, then the country&#x27;s spokesperson announces which country will receive the 12 points. Once jury points from all countries have been announced, the presenter(s) announce the total public points received for each finalist, with the votes for each country being consolidated and announced as a single value. Since , the public points have been revealed in ascending order based on the jury vote, with the country that received the fewest points from the jury being the first to receive their public points. A full breakdown of the results across all shows is published on the official Eurovision website after the final, including each country&#x27;s televoting ranking and the votes of its jury and individual jury members. Each country&#x27;s individual televoting points in the final are typically displayed on-screen by that country&#x27;s broadcaster following the announcement of the winner.

=== Broadcasting ===
Participating broadcasters are required to air live the semi-final in which they compete, or in the case of the automatic finalists the semi-final in which they are required to vote, and the final, in its entirety; this includes all competing songs, the voting recap containing short clips of the performances, the voting procedure or semi-final qualification reveal, and the reprise of the winning song in the final. Since 1999, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to provide advertising during short, non-essential hiatuses in the show&#x27;s schedule. In exceptional circumstances, such as due to developing emergency situations, participating broadcasters may delay or postpone broadcast of the event. Should a broadcaster fail to air a show as expected in any other scenario they may be subject to sanctions by the EBU. Several broadcasters in countries that are unable to compete have previously aired the contest in their markets.

As national broadcasters join and leave the Eurovision feed transmitted by the EBU, the EBU/Eurovision network logo ident (not to be confused with the logo of the song contest itself) is displayed. The accompanying music (used on other Eurovision broadcasts) is the Prelude &quot;(Marche en rondeau)&quot; to Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot;. Originally, the same logo was used for both the Eurovision network and the European Broadcasting Union, but they now have two different logos; the latest Eurovision network logo was introduced in 2012, and when the ident is transmitted at the start and end of programmes it is this Eurovision network logo that appears.

The EBU now holds the recordings of all but two editions of the contest in its archives, following a project initiated in 2011 to collate footage and related materials of all editions ahead of the event&#x27;s 60th edition in 2015. Although cameras were present to practice pan-European broadcasting for the first contest in 1956 to the few Europeans who had television sets, its audience was primarily over the radio. The only footage available is a Kinescope recording of Lys Assia&#x27;s reprise of her winning song. No full recording of the exists, with conflicting reports of the fate of any copies that may have survived. Audio recordings of both contests do, however, exist, and some short pieces of footage from both events have survived. Until 2004, the host broadcaster owned the copyright of the contest that they produced, with the EBU owning the copyright of all subsequent editions.

== Expansion of the contest ==
From the original seven countries which entered the first contest in 1956, the number of competing countries has steadily grown over time. 18 countries participated in the contest&#x27;s tenth edition in 1965, and by 1990, 22 countries were regularly competing each year.

Besides slight modifications to the voting system and other contest rules, no fundamental changes to the contest&#x27;s format were introduced until the early 1990s, when events in Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the breakup of Yugoslavia, with the subsequent admission into the EBU of the broadcasters of the countries that emerged from the breakup, and to the merger in 1993 of the EBU with its Eastern European counterpart, the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), which further expanded the number of broadcasters by including those from countries of the former Eastern Bloc. These events impacted the contest as they expanded the number of broadcasters eligible to participate with those from new countries.

=== Pre-selections and relegation ===
29 countries registered to take part in the 1993 contest, a figure the EBU considered unable to fit reasonably into a single TV show. A pre-selection method was subsequently introduced for the first time in order to reduce the number of competing entries, with seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe participating in &quot;Kvalifikacija za Millstreet&quot;, held in Ljubljana, Slovenia one month before the event. Following a vote amongst the seven competing countries, , and were chosen to head to the contest in Millstreet, Ireland, whilst , , and were forced to wait another year before being allowed to compete. A new relegation system was introduced for entry into the 1994 contest, with the lowest-placed countries being forced to sit out the following year&#x27;s event to be replaced by countries which had not competed in the previous contest. The bottom seven countries in 1993 were required to miss the following year&#x27;s contest, and were replaced by the four unsuccessful countries in &quot;Kvalifikacija za Millstreet&quot; and new entries from , and .

This system was used again in 1994 for qualification for the , but a new system was introduced for the , when an audio-only qualification round was held in the months before the contest in Oslo, Norway; this system was primarily introduced in an attempt to appease Germany, one of Eurovision&#x27;s biggest markets and financial contributors, which would have otherwise been relegated under the previous system. 29 countries competed for 22 places in the main contest alongside the automatically qualified Norwegian hosts. However, Germany would ultimately still miss out, and joined Hungary, Romania, Russia, , , and as one of the seven countries to be absent from the Oslo contest. this is the only ESC Germany has not participated in. For the , a similar relegation system to that used between 1993 and 1995 was introduced, with each country&#x27;s average scores in the preceding five contests being used as a measure to determine which countries would be relegated. This was subsequently changed again in 2001, back to the same system used between 1993 and 1995 where only the results from that year&#x27;s contest would count towards relegation.

=== The &quot;Big Five&quot; ===
In 1999, an exemption from relegation was introduced for France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, giving them an automatic right to compete in the 2000 contest and in all subsequent editions. This group, as the highest-paying EBU members which significantly fund the contest each year, subsequently became known as the &quot;Big Four&quot; countries. This group was expanded in 2011 when Italy began competing again, becoming the &quot;Big Five&quot;. Originally brought in to ensure that the financial contributions of the contest&#x27;s biggest financial backers would not be missed, since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 the &quot;Big Five&quot; countries have now automatically qualified for the final alongside the host country, and have not been required to compete in the semi-finals. 

There remains debate on whether this status prejudices the countries&#x27; results, based on reported antipathy over their automatic qualification and the potential disadvantage of having spent less time on stage through not competing in the semi-finals; however, this status appears to be more complex given that the results of the &quot;Big Five&quot; countries can vary widely. This status has caused consternation from other competing countries, and was cited, among other aspects, as a reason why had ceased participating after . In response to the criticism on less stage time from these countries, since the entries from the &quot;Big Five&quot; countries, along with the host country, have been performed live in one of the two semi-finals outside of the competition for qualification, a change which was announced as giving these countries &quot;a fairer playing field&quot; in the final.

=== Introduction of semi-finals ===

An influx of new countries applying for the resulted in the introduction of a semi-final from 2004, with the contest becoming a two-day event. The top 10 countries in each year&#x27;s final would qualify automatically to the following year&#x27;s final, alongside the &quot;Big Four&quot;, meaning all other countries would compete in the semi-final to compete for 10 qualification spots. The saw a record 36 countries competing, with new entries from , , and and the return of previously relegated countries. The format of this semi-final remained similar to the final proper, taking place a few days before the final; following the performances and the voting window, the names of the 10 countries with the highest number of points, which would therefore qualify for the final, were announced at the end of the show, revealed in a random order by the contest&#x27;s presenters.

The single semi-final continued to be held between 2005 and 2007; however, with 42 countries competing in the , that year&#x27;s semi-final had 28 entries competing for 10 spots in the final. Following criticism over the mainly Central and Eastern European qualifiers at the 2007 event and the poor performance of entries from Western European countries, a second semi-final was subsequently introduced for the , with all countries now competing in one of the two semi-finals, with only the host country and the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and subsequently the &quot;Big Five&quot; from 2011, qualifying automatically. 10 qualification spots would be available in each of the semi-finals, and a new system to split the competing countries between the two semi-finals was introduced based on their geographic location and previous voting patterns, in an attempt to reduce the impact of bloc voting and to make the outcome less predictable.

== Entries and participants ==

 The contest has been used as a launching point for artists who went on to achieve worldwide fame, and several of the world&#x27;s best-selling artists are counted among past Eurovision Song Contest participants and winning artists. ABBA, the winners for Sweden, have sold an estimated 380 million albums and singles since their contest win brought them to worldwide attention, with their winning song &quot;Waterloo&quot; selling over five million records. Celine Dion&#x27;s win for Switzerland in helped launch her international career, particularly in the anglophone market, and she would go on to sell an estimated 200 million records worldwide. Julio Iglesias was relatively unknown when he represented Spain in and placed fourth, but worldwide success followed his Eurovision appearance, with an estimated 100 million records sold during his career. Australian-British singer Olivia Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in 1974, placing fourth behind ABBA, but went on to sell an estimated 100 million records, win four Grammy Awards, and star in the critically and commercially successful musical film &quot;Grease&quot;.

A number of performers have competed in the contest after having already achieved considerable success. These include winning artists Lulu, Toto Cutugno, and Katrina and the Waves, and acts that failed to win such as Nana Mouskouri, Cliff Richard, Baccara, Umberto Tozzi, Plastic Bertrand, t.A.T.u., Las Ketchup, Patricia Kaas, Engelbert Humperdinck, Bonnie Tyler, and Flo Rida. Many well-known composers and lyricists have penned entries of varying success over the years, including Serge Gainsbourg, Goran Bregović, Diane Warren, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Pete Waterman, and Tony Iommi, as well as producers Timbaland and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.

Past participants have contributed to other fields in addition to their music careers. The Netherlands&#x27; Annie M. G. Schmidt, lyricist of the first entry performed at Eurovision, has gained a worldwide reputation for her stories and earned the Hans Christian Andersen Award for children&#x27;s literature. French &quot;yé-yé girls&quot; Françoise Hardy and contest winner France Gall are household names of 1960s pop culture, with Hardy also being a pioneer of street style fashion trends and an inspiration for the global youthquake movement. Figures who carved a career in politics and gained international acclaim for humanitarian achievements include contest winner Dana as a two-time Irish presidential candidate and Member of the European Parliament (MEP); Nana Mouskouri as Greek MEP and a UNICEF international goodwill ambassador; contest winner Ruslana as member of Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament and a figure of the Orange Revolution and Euromaidan protests, who gained global honours for leadership and courage; and North Macedonia&#x27;s Esma Redžepova as member of political parties and a two-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee.

Competing songs have occasionally gone on to become successes for their original performers and other artists, and some of the best-selling singles globally received their first international performances at Eurovision. &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;, the winning song in for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Brotherhood of Man, went on to sell over six million singles, more than any other winning song. &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&quot;, also known as &quot;Volare&quot;, Italy&#x27;s third-placed song in performed by Domenico Modugno, is the only Eurovision entry to win a Grammy Award. It was the first Grammy winner for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year and it has since been recorded by various artists, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States and achieved combined sales of over 22 million copies worldwide. &quot;Eres tú&quot;, performed by Spain&#x27;s Mocedades and runner-up in , became the first Spanish-language song to reach the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the Grammy-nominated &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;, which came eighth in for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Gina G, sold 790,000 records and achieved success across Europe and the US, reaching #1 on the UK Singles Chart and peaking at #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The turn of the century has also seen numerous competing songs becoming successes. &quot;Euphoria&quot;, Loreen&#x27;s winning song for Sweden in , achieved Europe-wide success, reaching number one in several countries and by 2014 had become the most downloaded Eurovision song to date. The video for &quot;Occidentali&#x27;s Karma&quot; by Francesco Gabbani, which placed sixth for Italy in , became the first Eurovision song to reach more than 200 million views on YouTube, while &quot;Soldi&quot; by Mahmood, the Italian runner-up in , was the most-streamed Eurovision song on Spotify until it was overtaken by that year&#x27;s winner for the Netherlands, &quot;Arcade&quot; by Duncan Laurence, following viral success on TikTok in late 2020 and early 2021; &quot;Arcade&quot; later became the first Eurovision song since &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot; and the first Eurovision winning song since &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, eventually peaking at #30. The saw the next major breakthrough success from Eurovision, with Måneskin, that year&#x27;s winners for Italy with &quot;&quot;, attracting worldwide attention across their repertoire immediately following their victory.

Johnny Logan was the first artist to have won multiple contests as a performer, winning for Ireland in with &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;, written by Shay Healy, and in with the self-penned &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;. Logan was also the winning songwriter in for the Irish winner, &quot;Why Me?&quot; performed by Linda Martin, and has therefore achieved three contest victories as either a performer or writer. Four further songwriters have each written two contest-winning songs: Willy van Hemert, Yves Dessca, Rolf Løvland, and Brendan Graham. Following their introduction in , Alexander Rybak became the first artist to win multiple Eurovision semi-finals, finishing in first at the second semi-finals in and ; he remains the only entrant to have done so to date.

=== Winners ===
71 songs from 27 countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest and have recorded the most wins with seven each, followed by , , the and the with five each. Of the 52 countries to have taken part, 24 have yet to win. Only one contest has featured multiple winners in a single year: in , four countries finished the contest with an equal number of points and were all declared winners due to the lack of tiebreak rules at the time. A majority of winning songs have been performed in English, particularly since the rule requiring native-language songs was abolished in 1999: since then, only seven winning songs have been performed either fully or partially in a language other than English.

Two countries have won the contest on their first appearance: , by virtue of winning the inaugural contest in 1956; and , which won in 2007 with its first participation as an independent country, following previous entries in union with now-defunct countries and . Other countries have had relatively short waits before winning their first contest, with winning on its second appearance in and winning with its third entry in . Conversely, some countries have had considerable gaps between their debut entry and their first win: recorded its first win in , 31 years after its first appearance, while ended a 45-year losing streak in . holds the record for the most contest entries prior to its first win in , coming 53 years after it first competed. Other countries have also had large gaps between their winning entries: Switzerland went 32 years between winning in 1956 and , and a further 36 years between then and winning in ; had a 37-year gap between its wins in and ; the Netherlands had a 44-year gap between its wins in and ; and achieved its second win in , 48 years after its first in .

The United Kingdom holds the record for runner-up placements, having finished second sixteen times. has finished last on a record twelve occasions, including scoring &quot;nul points&quot; four times; it shares the record for receiving this score with Austria. Countries have recorded back-to-back wins on four occasions: in and 1969; Luxembourg in and ; Israel in and ; and Ireland in , and , becoming the first and only country to date to win three times in a row. Additionally, Ireland later won the , giving it a record four wins in the span of five years.
The winning artists and songwriters receive a trophy, which since 2008 has followed a standard design: a handmade piece of sandblasted glass with painted details in the shape of a 1950s-style microphone, designed by Kjell Engman of the Swedish-based glassworks Kosta Boda. The trophy is typically presented by the previous year&#x27;s winner; others who have handed out the award in the past include representatives from the host broadcaster or the EBU, and politicians; in 2007, the fictional character Joulupukki (original Santa Claus from Finland) presented the award to the winner Marija Šerifović.

== Interval acts and guest appearances ==
Alongside the song contest and appearances from local and international personalities, performances from non-competing artists and musicians have been included since the first edition, and have become a staple of the live show. These performances have varied widely, previously featuring music, art, dance and circus performances, and past participants are regularly invited to perform, with the reigning champion traditionally returning each year to perform the previous year&#x27;s winning song.

The contest&#x27;s opening performance and the main interval act, held following the final competing song and before the announcement of the voting results, has become a memorable part of the contest and has included both internationally known artists and local stars. Contest organisers have previously used these performances as a way to explore their country&#x27;s culture and history, such as in &quot;4,000 Years of Greek Song&quot; at the held in Greece; other performances have been more comedic in nature, featuring parody and humour, as was the case with &quot;Love Love Peace Peace&quot; in , a humorous ode to the history and spectacle of the contest itself. &quot;Riverdance&quot;, which later became one of the most successful dance productions in the world, first began as the interval performance at the 1994 contest in Ireland; the seven-minute performance of traditional Irish music and dance was later expanded into a full stage show that has been seen by over 25 million people worldwide and provided a launchpad for its lead dancers Michael Flatley and Jean Butler.

Among other artists who have performed in a non-competitive manner are Danish Europop group Aqua in , Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica in 2007, Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. in , and American entertainers Justin Timberlake and Madonna in and respectively. Other notable artists, including Cirque du Soleil (), Alexandrov Ensemble (), Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir ( and ) and Fire of Anatolia (), also performed on the Eurovision stage, and there have been guest appearances from well-known faces from outside the world of music, including actors, athletes, and serving astronauts and cosmonauts. Guest performances have been used as a channel in response to global events happening concurrently with the contest. The in Israel closed with all competing acts performing a rendition of Israel&#x27;s winning song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; as a tribute to the victims of the war in the Balkans, a dance performance entitled &quot;The Grey People&quot; in 2016&#x27;s first semi-final was devoted to the European migrant crisis, the featured known anti-war songs &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;People Have the Power&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that same year, and an interval act in &#x27;s first semi-final alluded to the refugee crisis caused by the aforementioned invasion.

== Criticism and controversy ==
The contest has been the subject of considerable criticism regarding both its musical content and what has been reported to be a political element to the event, and several controversial moments have been witnessed over the course of its history. British historian Tony Judt wrote in 2006 that Eurovision became in the 1970s and 1980s &quot;the most widely celebrated object of ridicule&quot; on public television because it &quot;was so stunningly banal in conception and execution as to defy parody.&quot; Judt dismissed the singers as &quot;a stream of inept performers&quot; who would in most cases return to &quot;the obscurity from whence they briefly emerged.&quot;

=== Musical style and presentation ===
Criticism has been levied against the musical quality of past competing entries, with a perception that certain music styles seen as being presented more often than others in an attempt to appeal to as many potential voters as possible among the international audience. Power ballads, folk rhythms and bubblegum pop have been considered staples of the contest in recent years, leading to allegations that the event has become formulaic. Other traits in past competing entries which have regularly been mocked by media and viewers include an abundance of key changes and lyrics about love and/or peace, as well as the pronunciation of English by non-native users of the language. Given Eurovision is principally a television show, over the years competing performances have attempted to attract the viewers&#x27; attention through means other than music, and elaborate lighting displays, pyrotechnics, and extravagant on-stage theatrics and costumes having become a common sight at recent contests; criticism of these tactics have been levied as being a method of distracting the viewer from the weak musical quality of some of the competing entries.

While many of these traits are ridiculed in the media and elsewhere, for others these traits are celebrated and considered an integral part of what makes the contest appealing. Although many of the competing acts each year will fall into some of the categories above, the contest has seen a diverse range of musical styles in its history, including rock, heavy metal, jazz, country, electronic, R&amp;B, hip hop and avant-garde.

=== Political controversies ===
As artists and songs ultimately represent a country, the contest has seen several controversial moments where political tensions between competing countries as a result of frozen conflicts, and in some cases open warfare, are reflected in the performances and voting.

The conflict between and has affected the contest on numerous occasions. Conflicts between the two countries at Eurovision escalated quickly since both countries began competing in the late 2000s, resulting in fines and disciplinary action for both countries&#x27; broadcasters over political stunts, and a forced change of title for one competing song due to allegations of political subtext. Interactions between and in the contest had originally been positive, but as political relations soured between the two countries so, too, have relations at Eurovision become more complex. Complaints were levied against &#x27;s winning song in , &quot;1944&quot;, whose lyrics referenced the deportation of the Crimean Tatars, but which the claimed had a greater political meaning in light of Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea. As prepared to host the , Russia&#x27;s selected representative, Yuliya Samoylova, was barred from entering the country due to having previously entered Crimea illegally according to Ukrainian law. Russia eventually pulled out of the contest after offers for Samoylova to perform remotely were refused by Russia&#x27;s broadcaster, Channel One Russia, resulting in the EBU reprimanding the Ukrainian broadcaster, . In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent protests from other participating countries, was barred from competing in the , which went on to win. &#x27;s planned entry for the in Moscow, Russia, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Wanna Put In&quot;, caused controversy as the lyrics appeared to criticise Vladimir Putin, in a move seen as opposition to the then-Russian prime minister in the aftermath of the Russo-Georgian War. After requests by the EBU for changes to the lyrics were refused, Georgia&#x27;s broadcaster GPB subsequently withdrew from the event. &#x27; planned entry in , &quot;Ya nauchu tebya (I&#x27;ll Teach You)&quot;, also caused controversy in the wake of demonstrations against disputed election results, resulting in the country&#x27;s disqualification when the aforementioned song and another potential song were deemed to breach the contest&#x27;s rules on neutrality and politicisation.

&#x27;s participation in the contest has resulted in several controversial moments in the past, with the country&#x27;s first appearance in , less than a year after the Munich massacre, resulting in an increased security presence at the venue in Luxembourg City. &#x27;s first win in proved controversial for Arab states broadcasting the contest which would typically cut to advertisements when Israel performed due to a lack of recognition of the country, and when it became apparent Israel would win, many of these broadcasters cut the feed before the end of the voting. Arab states which are eligible to compete have declined to participate due to Israel&#x27;s presence, with the only Arab state to have entered Eurovision, competing for the first, and the only time, in when Israel was absent. Israeli participation has been criticised by those who oppose current government policies in the state, with calls raised by various political groups for a boycott ahead of the in Tel Aviv, including proponents of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in response to the country&#x27;s policies towards Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as groups who take issue with perceived pinkwashing in Israel. Others campaigned against a boycott, asserting that any cultural boycott would be antithetical to advancing peace in the region. Israel&#x27;s participation in the contest was again put into question following the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, with renewed calls for the nation&#x27;s exclusion ahead of the . Israel&#x27;s entry for that year&#x27;s contest was, however, accepted by the EBU, although it was required to undergo rewrites as the EBU objected to the political nature of the original lyrics, which made reference to the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel.

=== Political and geographical voting ===
The contest has been described as containing political elements in its voting process, a perception that countries will give votes more frequently and in higher quantities to other countries based on political relationships, rather than the musical merits of the songs themselves. Numerous studies and academic papers have been written on this subject, which have corroborated that certain countries form &quot;clusters&quot; or &quot;cliques&quot; by frequently voting in the same way; one study concludes that voting blocs can play a crucial role in deciding the winner of the contest, with evidence that on at least two occasions bloc voting was a pivotal factor in the vote for the winning song. Other views on these &quot;blocs&quot; argue that certain countries will allocate high points to others based on similar musical tastes, shared cultural links and a high degree of similarity and mutual intelligibility between languages, and are therefore more likely to appreciate and vote for the competing songs from these countries based on these factors, rather than political relationships specifically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spierdijk/Vellekoop&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis on other voting patterns have revealed examples which indicate voting preferences among countries based on shared religion, as well as &quot;patriotic voting&quot;, particularly since the introduction of televoting in , where foreign nationals vote for their country of origin.

Voting patterns in the contest have been reported by news publishers, including &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;BBC News&quot;. Criticism of the voting system was at its highest in the mid-2000s, resulting in a number of calls for countries to boycott the contest over reported voting biases, particularly following the where Eastern European countries occupied the top 15 places in the final and dominated the qualifying spaces. The poor performance of the entries from more traditional Eurovision countries had subsequently been discussed in European national parliaments, and the developments in the voting was cited as among the reasons for the resignation of Terry Wogan as commentator for the UK, a role he had performed at every contest from . In response to this criticism, the EBU introduced a second semi-final in , with countries split based on geographic proximity and voting history, and juries of music professionals were reintroduced in , in an effort to reduce the impacts of bloc voting.

=== LGBT visibility ===
Eurovision has had a long-held fan base in the LGBT community, and contest organisers have actively worked to include these fans in the event since the 1990s. Paul Oscar became the contest&#x27;s first openly gay artist to compete when he represented in . &#x27;s Dana International, the contest&#x27;s first trans performer, became the first LGBT artist to win in . In , Nikkie de Jager became the first trans person to host the contest.

Several open members of the LGBT community have since gone on to compete and win: Conchita Wurst, the drag persona of openly gay Thomas Neuwirth, won the for . Marija Šerifović, who won the 2007 contest for , subsequently came out publicly as a lesbian in 2013. Openly bisexual performer Duncan Laurence was the winner of the 2019 contest for the ; and rock band Måneskin, winners of the 2021 contest for , features openly bisexual Victoria De Angelis as its bassist. Nemo, the entrant in , was the first non-binary winner.

Past competing songs and performances have included references and allusions to same-sex relationships; &quot;Nous les amoureux&quot;, the winning song, contained references to the difficulties faced by a homosexual relationship; Krista Siegfrids&#x27; performance of &quot;Marry Me&quot; at the included a same-sex kiss with one of her female backing dancers; and the stage show of &#x27;s Ryan O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s &quot;Together&quot; in had two male dancers portraying a same-sex relationship. Drag performers, such as &#x27;s Verka Serduchka, &#x27;s DQ and &#x27;s Sestre, have appeared, including Wurst winning in 2014.

In recent years, various political ideologies across Europe have clashed in the Eurovision setting, particularly on LGBT rights. Dana International&#x27;s selection for the 1998 contest in Birmingham was marked by objections and death threats from orthodox religious sections of Israeli society, and at the contest her accommodation was reportedly in the only hotel in Birmingham with bulletproof windows. , once a regular participant and a one-time winner, first pulled out of the contest in , citing dissatisfaction in the voting rules and more recently Turkish broadcaster TRT have cited LGBT performances as another reason for their continued boycott, refusing to broadcast the 2013 event over &#x27;s same sex kiss. LGBT visibility in the contest has been cited as a deciding factor for &#x27;s non-participation since , although no official reason was given by the Hungarian broadcaster MTVA. The rise of anti-LGBTQ sentiment in Europe has led to a marked increase in booing from contest audiences, particularly since the introduction of a &quot;gay propaganda&quot; law in Russia in 2013. Conchita Wurst&#x27;s win was met with criticism on the Russian political stage, with several conservative politicians voicing displeasure in the result. Clashes on LGBT visibility in the contest have occurred in countries which do not compete, such as in , where broadcasting rights were terminated during the 2018 contest due to censorship of &quot;abnormal sexual relationships and behaviours&quot; that went against Chinese broadcasting guidelines.

== Cultural influence ==

The Eurovision Song Contest has amassed a global following and sees annual audience figures of between 100 and 600 million. The contest has become a cultural influence worldwide since its first years. It is regularly described as having kitsch appeal, and is included as a topic of parody in television sketches and in stage performances at the Edinburgh Fringe and Melbourne Comedy festivals amongst others. Several films have been created which celebrate the contest, including Eytan Fox&#x27;s 2013 Israeli comedy &quot;Cupcakes&quot;, and the Netflix 2020 musical comedy, &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot;, produced with backing from the EBU and starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams.

Eurovision has a large online following and multiple independent websites, news blogs and fan clubs are dedicated to the event. One of the oldest and largest Eurovision fan clubs is OGAE, founded in 1984 in Finland and currently a network of over 40 national branches across the world. National branches regularly host events to promote and celebrate Eurovision, and several participating broadcasters work closely with these branches when preparing their entries.

In the run-up to each year&#x27;s contest, several countries regularly host smaller events between the conclusion of the national selection shows in March and the contest proper in May, known as the &quot;pre-parties&quot;. These events typically feature the artists which will go on to compete at that year&#x27;s contest, and consist of performances at a venue and meet-and-greets with fans and the press. &quot;Eurovision in Concert&quot;, held annually in Amsterdam, was one of the first of these events to be created, holding its first edition in 2008. Other events held regularly include the &quot;London Eurovision Party&quot;, &quot;PrePartyES&quot; in Madrid, and &quot;Israel Calling&quot; in Tel Aviv. Several community events have been held virtually, particularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in 2020, among these &quot;EurovisionAgain&quot;, an initiative where fans watched and discussed past contests in sync on YouTube and other social media platforms. Launched during the first COVID-19 lockdowns, the event subsequently became a top trend on Twitter across Europe and facilitated over in donations for UK-based LGBTQ+ charities.

== Special events and related competitions ==

Several anniversary events, and related contests under the &quot;Eurovision Live Events&quot; brand, have been organised by the EBU with its member broadcasters. In addition, participating broadcasters have occasionally commissioned special Eurovision programmes for their home audiences, and a number of other imitator contests have been developed outside of the EBU framework, on both a national and international level.

The EBU has held several events to mark selected anniversaries in the contest&#x27;s history: &quot;Songs of Europe&quot;, held in 1981 to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary, had live performances and video recordings of all Eurovision Song Contest winners up to 1981; &quot;&quot; was organised in 2005 to celebrate the event&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, and featured a contest to determine the most popular song from among 14 selected entries from the contest&#x27;s first 50 years; and in 2015 the event&#x27;s sixtieth anniversary was marked by &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, a concert of performances by past Eurovision artists and video montages of performances and footage from previous contests. Following the cancellation of the , the EBU organised a special non-competitive broadcast, &quot;&quot;, which provided a showcase for the songs that would have taken part in the competition.

Other contests organised by the EBU include Eurovision Young Musicians, a classical music competition for European musicians between the ages of 12 and 21; Eurovision Young Dancers, a dance competition for non-professional performers between the ages of 16 and 21; Eurovision Choir, a choral competition for non-professional European choirs produced in partnership with the and modelled after the World Choir Games; and the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, a similar song contest for singers aged between 9 and 14 representing primarily European countries. The Eurovision Dance Contest was an event featuring pairs of dancers performing ballroom and Latin dancing, which took place for two editions, in 2007 and 2008.

Similar international music competitions have been organised externally to the EBU. The Sopot International Song Festival has been held annually since 1961; between 1977 and 1980, under the patronage of the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), an Eastern European broadcasting union similar to the EBU, it was rebranded as the Intervision Song Contest. An Ibero-American contest, the OTI Festival, was held by the Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana (OTI) between 1972 and 2000 among hispanophone and lusophone broadcasters in Europe and the Americas; and a contest for countries and autonomous regions with Turkic links, the Turkvision Song Contest, has been organised since 2013. Similarly, an adaption of the contest for artists in the United States, the &quot;American Song Contest&quot;, was held in 2022 and featured songs representing U.S. states and territories. Adaptions of the contest for artists in Canada and Latin America are in development, though development on the former has been halted.

<doc id="9955" wikidata="Q898391" url="?curid=9955" title="Nitrox">
<text>Nitrox refers to any gas mixture composed (excepting trace gases) of nitrogen and oxygen that contains less than 78% nitrogen. In the usual application, underwater diving, nitrox is normally distinguished from air and handled differently. The most common use of nitrox mixtures containing oxygen in higher proportions than atmospheric air is in scuba diving, where the reduced partial pressure of nitrogen is advantageous in reducing nitrogen uptake in the body&#x27;s tissues, thereby extending the practicable underwater dive time by reducing the decompression requirement, or reducing the risk of decompression sickness (also known as &quot;the bends&quot;). The two most common recreational diving nitrox mixes are 32% and 36% oxygen, which have maximum operating depths of about 110 feet (34 meters) and 95 feet (29 meters) respectively.

Nitrox is used to a lesser extent in surface-supplied diving, as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risks of oxygen toxicity and fire.

Though not generally referred to as nitrox, an oxygen-enriched air mixture is routinely provided at normal surface ambient pressure as oxygen therapy to patients with compromised respiration and circulation.

==Physiological effects under pressure==
===Decompression benefits===

Reducing the proportion of nitrogen by increasing the proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of decompression sickness for the same dive profile, or allows extended dive times without increasing the need for decompression stops for the same risk. The significant aspect of extended no-stop time when using nitrox mixtures is reduced risk in a situation where breathing gas supply is compromised, as the diver can make a direct ascent to the surface with an acceptably low risk of decompression sickness. The exact values of the extended no-stop times vary depending on the decompression model used to derive the tables, but as an approximation, it is based on the partial pressure of nitrogen at the dive depth. This principle can be used to calculate an equivalent air depth (EAD) with the same partial pressure of nitrogen as the mix to be used, and this depth is less than the actual dive depth for oxygen enriched mixtures. The equivalent air depth is used with air decompression tables to calculate decompression obligation and no-stop times. The Goldman decompression model predicts a significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).

===Nitrogen narcosis===

Controlled tests have not shown breathing nitrox to reduce the effects of nitrogen narcosis, as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only to the use of nitrox. Nonetheless, there are people in the diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox. This may be due to a dissociation of the subjective and behavioural effects of narcosis. Although oxygen appears chemically more narcotic at the surface, relative narcotic effects at depth have never been studied in detail, but it is known that different gases produce different narcotic effects as depth increases. Helium has no narcotic effect, but results in HPNS when breathed at high pressures, which does not happen with gases that have greater narcotic potency. However, because of risks associated with oxygen toxicity, divers do not usually use nitrox at greater depths where more pronounced narcosis symptoms are more likely to occur. For deep diving, trimix or heliox gases are typically used; these gases contain helium to reduce the amount of narcotic gases in the mixture.

===Oxygen toxicity===

Diving with and handling nitrox raise a number of potentially fatal dangers due to the high partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2). Nitrox is not a deep-diving gas mixture owing to the increased proportion of oxygen, which becomes toxic when breathed at high pressure. For example, the maximum operating depth of nitrox with 36% oxygen, a popular recreational diving mix, is to ensure a maximum ppO2 of no more than . The exact value of the maximum allowed ppO2 and maximum operating depth varies depending on factors such as the training agency, the type of dive, the breathing equipment and the level of surface support, with professional divers sometimes being allowed to breathe higher ppO2 than those recommended to recreational divers.

To dive safely with nitrox, the diver must learn good buoyancy control, a vital part of scuba diving in its own right, and a disciplined approach to preparing, planning and executing a dive to ensure that the ppO2 is known, and the maximum operating depth is not exceeded. Many dive shops, dive operators, and gas blenders (individuals trained to blend gases) require the diver to present a nitrox certification card before selling nitrox to divers. Additionally, it is strongly encouraged for divers to confirm the percentage of oxygen in their tank before every dive, regardless of the specified amount on their tank. This is done by expelling a small amount of air from the diver&#x27;s tank into an oxygen analyzer. This is to further limit the possibility of oxygen toxicity due to errors in previous testing.

Some training agencies, such as PADI and Technical Diving International, teach the use of two depth limits to protect against oxygen toxicity. The shallower depth is called the &quot;maximum operating depth&quot; and is reached when the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas reaches . The deeper depth, called the &quot;contingency depth&quot;, is reached when the partial pressure reaches . Diving at or beyond this level exposes the diver to a greater risk of central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity. This can be extremely dangerous since its onset is often without warning and can lead to drowning, as the regulator may be spat out during convulsions, which occur in conjunction with sudden unconsciousness (general seizure induced by oxygen toxicity).

Divers trained to use nitrox may memorise the acronym VENTID-C or sometimes ConVENTID, (which stands for Vision (blurriness), Ears (ringing sound), Nausea, Twitching, Irritability, Dizziness, and Convulsions). However, evidence from non-fatal oxygen convulsions indicates that most convulsions are not preceded by any warning symptoms at all. Further, many of the suggested warning signs are also symptoms of nitrogen narcosis, and so may lead to misdiagnosis by a diver. A solution to either is to ascend to a shallower depth.

===Carbon dioxide retention===
Use of nitrox may cause a reduced ventilatory response, and when breathing dense gas at the deeper limits of the usable range, this may result in carbon dioxide retention when exercise levels are high, with an increased risk of loss of consciousness.

===Other effects===
There is anecdotal evidence that the use of nitrox reduces post-dive fatigue, particularly in older and or obese divers; however a double-blind study to test this found no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue. There was, however, some suggestion that post-dive fatigue is due to sub-clinical decompression sickness (DCS) (i.e. micro bubbles in the blood insufficient to cause symptoms of DCS); the fact that the study mentioned was conducted in a dry chamber with an ideal decompression profile may have been sufficient to reduce sub-clinical DCS and prevent fatigue in both nitrox and air divers. In 2008, a study was published using wet divers at the same depth no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue was seen.

Further studies with a number of different dive profiles, and also different levels of exertion, would be necessary to fully investigate this issue. For example, there is much better scientific evidence that breathing high-oxygen gases increases exercise tolerance, during aerobic exertion. Though even moderate exertion while breathing from the regulator is a relatively uncommon occurrence in recreational scuba, as divers usually try to minimize it in order to conserve gas, episodes of exertion while regulator-breathing do occasionally occur in recreational diving. Examples are surface-swimming a distance to a boat or beach after surfacing, where residual &quot;safety&quot; cylinder gas is often used freely, since the remainder will be wasted anyway when the dive is completed, and unplanned contingencies due to currents or buoyancy problems. It is possible that these so-far un-studied situations have contributed to some of the positive reputation of nitrox.

A 2010 study using critical flicker fusion frequency and perceived fatigue criteria found that diver alertness after a dive on nitrox was significantly better than after an air dive.

==Uses==
===Underwater diving===

Enriched Air Nitrox, nitrox with an oxygen content above 21%, is mainly used in scuba diving to reduce the proportion of nitrogen in the breathing gas mixture. The main benefit is reduced decompression risk. To a considerably lesser extent it is also used in surface supplied diving, where the logistics are relatively complex, similar to the use of other diving gas mixtures like heliox and trimix.

====Training and certification====

 (Nitrox diver) allows the diver to use a single nitrox gas mixture with 40% or less oxygen by volume on a dive without obligatory decompression. The reason for using nitrox on this type of dive profile can be to extend the no-decompression limit, and for shorter dives, to reduce the decompression stress. The course is short, with a theory module on the risks of oxygen toxicity and the calculation of maximum operating depth, and a practical module of generally two dives using nitrox. It is one of the most popular further training programmes for entry level divers as it makes longer dives possible at a large number of popular sites. Gases suitable for this application may be referred to as recreational nitrox.

Advanced nitrox certification () requires competence to carry two nitrox mixtures in separate scuba sets, and to use the richer mix for accelerated decompression at the end of the dive, switching gases underwater at the correct planned depth and selecting the new gas on the dive computer if one is carried. For the purposes of the certification any mixture from air to nominally 100% oxygen may be used, though at least one agency prefers to limit oxygen fraction to 80% as they consider this has a lower risk for acute oxygen toxicity.

===Therapeutic recompression===

Nitrox50 is used as one of the options in the first stages of therapeutic recompression using the Comex therapeutic table CX 30 for treatment of vestibular or general decompression sickness. Nitrox is breathed at 30 msw and 24 msw and the ascents from these depths to the next stop. At 18 m the gas is switched to oxygen for the rest of the treatment.

===Medicine, mountaineering and unpressurised aircraft===
The use of oxygen at high altitudes or as oxygen therapy may be as supplementary oxygen, added to the inspired air, which would technically be a use of nitrox, blended on site, but this is not normally referred to as such, as the gas provided for the purpose is oxygen.

==Terminology==
Nitrox is known by many names: Enriched Air Nitrox, Oxygen Enriched Air, Nitrox, EANx or Safe Air. Since the word is a compound contraction or coined word and not an acronym, it should not be written in all upper case characters as &quot;NITROX&quot;, but may be initially capitalized when referring to specific mixtures such as Nitrox32, which contains 68% nitrogen and 32% oxygen. When one figure is stated, it refers to the oxygen percentage, not the nitrogen percentage. The original convention, Nitrox68/32 became shortened as the first figure is redundant.

The term &quot;nitrox&quot; was originally used to refer to the breathing gas in a seafloor habitat where the oxygen has to be kept to a lower fraction than in air to avoid long term oxygen toxicity problems. It was later used by Dr Morgan Wells of NOAA for mixtures with an oxygen fraction higher than air, and has become a generic term for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen with any oxygen fraction, and in the context of recreational and technical diving, now usually refers to a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with more than 21% oxygen. &quot;Enriched Air Nitrox&quot; or &quot;EAN&quot;, and &quot;Oxygen Enriched Air&quot; are used to emphasize richer than air mixtures. In &quot;EANx&quot;, the &quot;x&quot; was originally the x of nitrox, but has come to indicate the percentage of oxygen in the mix and is replaced by a number when the percentage is known; for example, a 40% oxygen mix is called EAN40. The two most popular blends are EAN32 and EAN36, developed by NOAA for scientific diving, and also named Nitrox I and Nitrox II, respectively, or Nitrox68/32 and Nitrox64/36. These two mixtures were first utilized to the depth and oxygen limits for scientific diving designated by NOAA at the time.

The term Oxygen Enriched Air (OEN) was accepted by the (American) scientific diving community, but although it is probably the most unambiguous and simply descriptive term yet proposed, it was resisted by the recreational diving community, sometimes in favour of less appropriate terminology.

In its early days of introduction to non-technical divers, nitrox has occasionally also been known by detractors by less complimentary terms, such as &quot;devil gas&quot; or &quot;voodoo gas&quot; (a term now sometimes used with pride).

American Nitrox Divers International (ANDI) uses the term &quot;SafeAir&quot;, which they define as any oxygen-enriched air mixture with O2 concentrations between 22% and 50% that meet their gas quality and handling specifications, and specifically claim that these mixtures are safer than normally produced breathing air for the end user not envolved to the mix production which. Considering the complexities and hazards of mixing, handling, analyzing, and using oxygen-enriched air, this name is considered inappropriate by those who consider that it is not inherently &quot;safe&quot;, but merely has decompression advantages.

===MOD===

Maximum Operating Depth (MOD) is the maximum safe depth at which a given nitrox mixture can be used. MOD depends on the allowed partial pressure of oxygen, which is related to exposure time and the acceptable risk assumed for central nervous system oxygen toxicity. Acceptable maximum ppO2 varies depending on the application:
* 1.2 is often used in closed circuit rebreathers.
* 1.4 is recommended by several recreational training agencies for ordinary scuba diving.
* 1.5 is allowed for commercial diving in some jurisdictions.
* 1.6 is allowed for technical diving decompression stops, and is the recommended maximum according to NOAA
Higher values are used by commercial and military divers in special circumstances, often when the diver uses surface supplied breathing apparatus, or for treatment in a chamber, where the airway is relatively secure.

==Equipment==
==Choice of mixture==
The two most common recreational diving nitrox mixes contain 32% and 36% oxygen, which have maximum operating depths (MODs) of and respectively when limited to a maximum partial pressure of oxygen of . Divers may calculate an equivalent air depth to determine their decompression requirements or may use nitrox tables or a nitrox-capable dive computer.

Nitrox with more than 40% oxygen is uncommon within recreational diving. There are two main reasons for this: the first is that all pieces of diving equipment that come into contact with mixes containing higher proportions of oxygen, particularly at high pressure, need special cleaning and servicing to reduce the risk of fire. The second reason is that richer mixes extend the time the diver can stay underwater without needing decompression stops far further than the duration permitted by the capacity of typical diving cylinders. For example, based on the PADI nitrox recommendations, the maximum operating depth for EAN45 would be and the maximum dive time available at this depth even with EAN36 is nearly 1 hour 15 minutes: a diver with a breathing rate of 20 litres per minute using twin 10-litre, 230-bar (about double 85 cu. ft.) cylinders would have completely emptied the cylinders after 1 hour 14 minutes at this depth.

Use of nitrox mixtures containing 50% to 80% oxygen is common in technical diving as decompression gas, which by virtue of its lower partial pressure of inert gases such as nitrogen and helium, allows for more efficient (faster) elimination of these gases from the tissues than leaner oxygen mixtures.

In deep open circuit technical diving, where hypoxic gases are breathed during the bottom portion of the dive, a Nitrox mix with 50% or less oxygen called a &quot;travel mix&quot; is sometimes breathed during the beginning of the descent in order to avoid hypoxia. Normally, however, the most oxygen-lean of the diver&#x27;s decompression gases would be used for this purpose, since descent time spent reaching a depth where bottom mix is no longer hypoxic is normally small, and the distance between this depth and the MOD of any nitrox decompression gas is likely to be very short, if it occurs at all.

===Best mix===
The composition of a nitrox mix can be optimized for a given planned dive profile. This is termed &quot;Best mix&quot;, for the dive, and provides the maximum no-decompression time compatible with acceptable oxygen exposure. An acceptable maximum partial pressure of oxygen is selected based on depth and planned bottom time, and this value is used to calculate the oxygen content of the best mix for the dive:

:formula_1

==Production==
There are several methods of production:
* Mixing by partial pressure: a measured pressure of oxygen is decanted into the cylinder and cylinder is &quot;topped up&quot; with air from the diving air compressor. This method is very versatile and requires relatively little additional equipment if a suitable compressor is available, but it is labour-intensive, and high partial pressures of oxygen are relatively hazardous.
* Pre-mix decanting: the gas supplier provides large cylinders with popular mixes such as 32% and 36%. These may be further diluted with air to provide a larger range of mixtures.
* Mixing by continuous blending: measured quantities of oxygen are introduced to air and mixed with it before it reaches the compressor inlet. Concentration of oxygen is commonly monitored as partial pressure using an oxygen cell. The compressor and particularly the compressor oil, must be suitable for this service. If the resulting oxygen fraction is less than 40%, the cylinder and valve may not be required to be cleaned for oxygen service. Relatively efficient and quick compared to partial pressure blending, but requires a suitable compressor, and the range of mixes may be limited by the compressor specification.
* Mixing by mass fraction: oxygen and air or nitrogen are added to a cylinder that is accurately weighed until the required mix is achieved. This method requires fairly large and highly accurate scales, otherwise it is similar to partial pressure blending, but insensitive to temperature variations.
* Mixing by gas separation: a nitrogen permeable membrane is used to remove some of the nitrogen molecules from air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor. A limited range of mixes is possible, but the equipment is quick and easy to operate and relatively safe, as there is never high partial pressure oxygen involved. A supply of clean low-pressure air at a constant temperature is required for consistent results. This may be supplied from a low pressure compressor or a regulated supply from high pressure storage or compressor. The air must be free of contaminants that could clog the membrane, and at a constant inlet temperature and pressure to produce a consistent delivered partial pressure of oxygen. The air must be of breathing quality, other contaminants must be filtered out independently. The input air pressure is regulated and pressure over the membrane controlled to adjust the product oxygen fraction. CGA Grade D or E air quality is suitable for supply gas, and is commonly heated to a constant inlet temperature. Heating also reduces the chance of high humidity causing wetting of the membrane. In a typical system supply air enters the thousands of hollow fibres of the membrane at one end, and oxygen preferentially permeates the fibre walls, leaving mostly nitrogen at the discharge end, which is vented from the system as waste.
* Pressure swing adsorption requires relatively complex equipment, otherwise the advantages are similar to membrane separation. PSA is a technology used to separate gases from a mixture under pressure according to the molecular characteristics and affinity for an adsorbent material of the gases at near-ambient temperatures. Specific adsorbent materials are used as a trap, preferentially adsorbing the target gases at high pressure. The process then swings to low pressure to desorb the adsorbed material and flush the adsorbent container so that it can be reused.

==Cylinder markings to identify contents==
Any diving cylinder containing a blend of gasses other than standard air is required by most diver training organizations, and some national governments, to be clearly marked to indicate the current gas mixture. In practice it is common to use a printed adhesive label to indicate the type of gas (in this case nitrox), and to add a temporary label to specify the analysis of the current mix.

==Regional standards and conventions==

===European Union===
Within the EU, valves with M26x2 outlet thread are recommended for cylinders with increased oxygen content. Regulators for use with these cylinders require compatible connectors, and are not directly connectable with cylinders for compressed air.

===Germany===
A nitrox cylinder is specially cleaned and identified. According to EN 144-3 the cylinder colour is overall white with the letter N on opposite sides of the cylinder. The fraction of oxygen in the bottle is checked after filling and marked on the cylinder.

===South Africa===
South African National Standard 10019:2008 specifies the colour of all scuba cylinders as Golden yellow with French gray shoulder. This applies to all underwater breathing gases except medical oxygen, which must be carried in cylinders that are Black with a White shoulder. Nitrox cylinders must be identified by a transparent, self-adhesive label with green lettering, fitted below the shoulder. In effect this is green lettering on a yellow cylinder, with a gray shoulder. The composition of the gas must also be specified on the label. In practice this is done by a small additional self-adhesive label marked with the measured oxygen fraction, which is changed when a new mix is filled.

The 2021 revision of SANS 10019 changed the colour specification to Light navy grey for the shoulder, and a different label specification which includes hazard symbols for high pressure and oxidising materials.

===United States===

Every nitrox cylinder should also have a sticker stating whether or not the cylinder is &quot;oxygen clean&quot; and suitable for partial pressure blending. Any oxygen-clean cylinder may have any mix up to 100% oxygen inside. If by some accident an oxygen-clean cylinder is filled at a station that does not supply gas to oxygen-clean standards it is then considered contaminated and must be re-cleaned before a gas containing more than 40% oxygen may again be added. Cylinders marked as &#x27;not oxygen clean&#x27; may only be filled with oxygen-enriched air mixtures from membrane or stick blending systems where the gas is mixed before being added to the cylinder, and to an oxygen fraction not exceeding 40% by volume.

==Hazards==
Nitrox can be a hazard to the blender and to the user, for different reasons.

===Fire and toxic cylinder contamination from oxygen reactions===
Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen decanted into the cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute a relatively high fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen is often used to provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.

Any gas which contains a significantly larger percentage of oxygen than air is a fire hazard, and such gases can react with hydrocarbons or lubricants and sealing materials inside the filling system to produce toxic gases, even if a fire is not apparent. Some organisations exempt equipment from oxygen-clean standards if the oxygen fraction is limited to 40% or less.

Among recreational training agencies, only ANDI subscribes to the guideline of requiring oxygen cleaning for equipment used with more than 23% oxygen fraction. The USCG, NOAA, U.S. Navy, OSHA, and the other recreational training agencies accept the limit as 40% as no accident or incident has been known to occur when this guideline has been properly applied. Tens of thousands of recreational divers are trained each year and the overwhelming majority of these divers are taught the &quot;over 40% rule&quot;. Most nitrox fill stations which supply pre-mixed nitrox will fill cylinders with mixtures below 40% without certification of cleanliness for oxygen service. Luxfer cylinders specify oxygen cleaning for all mixtures exceeding 23.5% oxygen.

The following references for oxygen cleaning specifically cite the &quot;over 40%&quot; guideline that has been in widespread use since the 1960s, and consensus at the 1992 Enriched Air Workshop was to accept that guideline and continue the status quo.
* Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.430 (i) – Commercial Diving Operations
* OSHA Oxygen Specifications 1910.420 (1)
* NOAA Oxygen Specifications (appendix D)
* U.S. Navy Oxygen Specifications U.S. MIL-STD-777E (SH) Note K-6-4, Cat. K.6
* U.S. Coast Guard Oxygen Specifications Title 46: Shipping, revisions through 10-1-92. 197.452 Oxygen Cleaning 46 CFR 197.451

Much of the confusion appears to be a result of misapplying PVHO (pressure vessel for human occupancy) guidelines which prescribe a maximum ambient oxygen content of 25% when a human is sealed into a pressure vessel (chamber). The concern here is for a fire hazard to a living person who could be trapped in an oxygen-rich burning environment.

Of the three commonly applied methods of producing enriched air mixes – continuous blending, partial pressure blending, and membrane separation systems – only partial pressure blending would require the valve and cylinder components to be oxygen cleaned for mixtures with less than 40% oxygen. The other two methods ensure that the equipment is never subjected to greater than 40% oxygen content.

In a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. If the vessel contents are ignitable or a contaminant is present this event may result in a &quot;fireball&quot;.

===Incorrect gas mix===
Use of a gas mix that differs from the planned mix introduces an increased risk of decompression sickness or an increased risk of oxygen toxicity, depending on the error. It may be possible to simply recalculate the dive plan or set the dive computer accordingly, but in some cases the planned dive may not be practicable.

Many training agencies such as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the planned mix, the diver must either recalculate the dive plan with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a blended gas records book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen fraction by percentage, the calculated maximum operating depth for that mix, and the signature of the receiving diver, who should have personally measured the oxygen fraction before taking delivery. All of these steps reduce risk but increase complexity of operations as each diver must use the specific cylinder they have checked out. In South Africa, the national standard for handling and filling portable cylinders with pressurised gases (SANS 10019) requires that the cylinder be labelled with a sticker identifying the contents as nitrox, and specifying the oxygen fraction. Similar requirements may apply in other countries.

==History==
In 1874, Henry Fleuss made what was possibly the first Nitrox dive using a rebreather.

In 1911, Draeger of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a standard diving suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m.

Christian J. Lambertsen proposed calculations for nitrogen addition to prevent oxygen toxicity in divers utilizing nitrogen–oxygen rebreather diving.

In World War II or soon after, British commando frogmen and clearance divers started occasionally diving with oxygen rebreathers adapted for semi-closed-circuit nitrox (which they called &quot;mixture&quot;) diving by fitting larger cylinders and carefully setting the gas flow rate using a flow meter. These developments were kept secret until independently duplicated by civilians in the 1960s.

Lambertson published a paper on nitrox in 1947.

In the 1950s, the United States Navy (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the US Navy Diving Manual.

In 1955, E. Lanphier described the use of nitrogen–oxygen diving mixtures, and the equivalent air depth method for calculating decompression from air tables.

In the 1960s, A. Galerne used on-line blending for commercial diving.

In 1970, Morgan Wells, who was the first director of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. He introduced the concept of Equivalent Air Depth (EAD). He also developed a process for mixing oxygen and air which he called a continuous blending system. For many years Wells&#x27; invention was the only practical alternative to partial pressure blending. In 1979 NOAA published Wells&#x27; procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual.

In 1985 Dick Rutkowski, a former NOAA diving safety officer, formed IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community.

In 1989, the Harbor Branch Oceanographic institution workshop addressed blending, oxygen limits and decompression issues.

In 1991, Bove, Bennett and &quot;Skin Diver&quot; magazine took a stand against nitrox use for recreational diving. &quot;Skin Diver&quot; editor Bill Gleason dubbed nitrox the &quot;Voodoo Gas&quot;. The annual DEMA show (held in Houston, Texas that year) banned nitrox training providers from the show. This caused a backlash, and when DEMA relented, a number of organizations took the opportunity to present nitrox workshops outside the show.

In 1992, the Scuba Diving Resources Group organised a workshop where some guidelines were established, and some misconceptions addressed.

In 1992, BSAC banned its members from using nitrox during BSAC activities. IAND&#x27;s name was changed to the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD), the T being added when the European Association of Technical Divers (EATD) merged with IAND. In the early 1990s, these agencies were teaching nitrox, but the main scuba agencies were not. Additional new organizations, including the American Nitrox Divers International (ANDI) – which invented the term &quot;Safe Air&quot; for marketing purposes – and Technical Diving International (TDI) were begun. NAUI became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox.

In 1993, the Sub-Aqua Association was the first UK recreational diving training agency to acknowledge and endorse the Nitrox training their members had undertaken with one of the tech agencies. The SAA&#x27;s first recreational Nitrox qualification was issued in April 1993. The SAA&#x27;s first Nitrox instructor was Vic Bonfante and he was certified in September 1993.

Meanwhile, diving stores were finding a purely economic reason to offer nitrox: not only was an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. With the new dive computers which could be programmed to allow for the longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased.

In 1993, &quot;Skin Diver&quot; magazine, the leading recreational diving publication at the time, published a three-part series arguing that nitrox was unsafe for sport divers. DiveRite manufactured the first nitrox-compatible dive computer, called the Bridge, the aquaCorps TEK93 conference was held in San Francisco, and a practicable oil limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for oxygen compatible air was set. The Canadian armed forces issued EAD tables with an upper PO2 of 1.5 ATA.

In 1994, John Lamb and Vandagraph launched the first oxygen analyzer built specifically for Nitrox and mixed-gas divers, at the Birmingham Dive Show.

In 1994, BSAC reversed its policy on Nitrox and announced BSAC nitrox training to start in 1995.

In 1996, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox. While other mainline scuba organizations had announced their support of nitrox earlier, it was PADI&#x27;s endorsement that established nitrox as a standard recreational diving option.

In 1997, ProTec started with Nitrox 1 (recreational) and Nitrox 2 (technical). A German ProTec Nitrox manual (ref to the 6th edition) has been published.

In 1999, a survey by R.W. Hamilton showed that over hundreds of thousands of nitrox dives, the DCS record is good. Nitrox had become popular with recreational divers, but not used much by commercial divers who tend to use surface supplied breathing apparatus. The OSHA accepted a petition for a variance from the commercial diving regulations for recreational scuba instructors.

The 2001 edition of the &quot;NOAA Diving Manual&quot; included a chapter intended for Nitrox training.

==In nature==
At times in the geological past, the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contained much more than 20% oxygen: e.g. up to 35% in the Upper Carboniferous period. This let animals absorb oxygen more easily and influenced their evolutionary patterns.

<text>Eric Alfred Leslie Satie (17 May 18661 July 1925), who signed his name Erik Satie after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. He was the son of a French father and a British mother. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, but was an undistinguished student and obtained no diploma. In the 1880s he worked as a pianist in café-cabaret in Montmartre, Paris, and began composing works, mostly for solo piano, such as his &quot;Gymnopédies&quot; and &quot;Gnossiennes&quot;. He also wrote music for a Rosicrucian sect to which he was briefly attached.

After a spell in which he composed little, Satie entered Paris&#x27;s second music academy, the Schola Cantorum, as a mature student. His studies there were more successful than those at the Conservatoire. From about 1910 he became the focus of successive groups of young composers attracted by his unconventionality and originality. Among them were the group known as Les Six. A meeting with Jean Cocteau in 1915 led to the creation of the ballet &quot;Parade&quot; (1917) for Serge Diaghilev, with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine.

Satie&#x27;s example guided a new generation of French composers away from post-Wagnerian impressionism towards a sparer, terser style. Among those influenced by him during his lifetime were Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, and Francis Poulenc, and he is seen as an influence on more recent composers such as John Cage and John Adams. His harmony is often characterised by unresolved chords, he sometimes dispensed with bar-lines, as in his &quot;Gnossiennes&quot;, and his melodies are generally simple and often reflect his love of old church music. He gave some of his later works absurd titles, such as &quot;Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien)&quot; (&quot;True Flabby Preludes (for a Dog)&quot;, 1912), &quot;Croquis et agaceries d&#x27;un gros bonhomme en bois&quot; (&quot;Sketches and Exasperations of a Big Wooden Man&quot;, 1913) and &quot;Sonatine bureaucratique&quot; (&quot;Bureaucratic Sonatina&quot;, 1917). Most of his works are brief, and the majority are for solo piano. Exceptions include his &quot;symphonic drama&quot; &quot;Socrate&quot; (1919) and two late ballets &quot;Mercure&quot; and &quot;Relâche&quot; (1924).

Satie never married, and his home for most of his adult life was a single small room, first in Montmartre and, from 1898 to his death, in Arcueil, a suburb of Paris. He adopted various images over the years, including a period in quasi-priestly dress, another in which he always wore identically coloured velvet suits, and is known for his last persona, in neat bourgeois costume, with bowler hat, wing collar, and umbrella. He was a lifelong heavy drinker, and died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 59.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Satie was born on 17 May 1866 in Honfleur, Normandy, the first child of Alfred Satie and his wife Jane Leslie (&quot;née&quot; Anton). Jane Satie was an English Protestant of Scottish descent; Alfred Satie, a shipping broker, was a Roman Catholic anglophobe. A year later, the Saties had a daughter, Olga, and in 1869 a second son, Conrad. The children were baptised in the Anglican church.

After the Franco-Prussian War Alfred Satie sold his business and the family moved to Paris, where he eventually set up as a music publisher. In 1872 Jane Satie died and Eric and his brother were sent back to Honfleur to be brought up by Alfred&#x27;s parents. The boys were rebaptised as Roman Catholics and educated at a local boarding school, where Satie excelled in history and Latin but nothing else. In 1874 he began taking music lessons with a local organist, Gustave Vinot, a former pupil of Louis Niedermeyer. Vinot stimulated Satie&#x27;s love of old church music, and in particular Gregorian chant.

In 1878 Satie&#x27;s grandmother died, and the two boys returned to Paris to be informally educated by their father. Satie did not attend a school, but his father took him to lectures at the and engaged a tutor to teach Eric Latin and Greek. Before the boys returned to Paris from Honfleur, Alfred had met a piano teacher and salon composer, Eugénie Barnetche, whom he married in January 1879, to the dismay of the twelve-year-old Satie, who did not like her.

Eugénie Satie resolved that her elder stepson should become a professional musician, and in November 1879 enrolled him in the preparatory piano class at the Paris Conservatoire. Satie strongly disliked the Conservatoire, which he described as &quot;a vast, very uncomfortable, and rather ugly building; a sort of district prison with no beauty on the inside – nor on the outside, for that matter&quot;. He studied solfeggio with Albert Lavignac and piano with Émile Decombes, who had been a pupil of Frédéric Chopin. In 1880 Satie took his first examinations as a pianist: he was described as &quot;gifted but indolent&quot;. The following year Decombes called him &quot;the laziest student in the Conservatoire&quot;. In 1882 he was expelled from the Conservatoire for his unsatisfactory performance.

In 1884 Satie wrote his first known composition, a short Allegro for piano, written while on holiday in Honfleur. He signed himself &quot;Erik&quot; on this and subsequent compositions, though continuing to use &quot;Eric&quot; on other documents until 1906. In 1885, he was readmitted to the Conservatoire, in the intermediate piano class of his stepmother&#x27;s former teacher, Georges Mathias. He made little progress: Mathias described his playing as &quot;Insignificant and laborious&quot; and Satie himself &quot;Worthless. Three months just to learn the piece. Cannot sight-read properly&quot;. Satie became fascinated by aspects of religion. He spent much time in Notre-Dame de Paris contemplating the stained glass windows and in the National Library examining obscure medieval manuscripts. His friend Alphonse Allais later dubbed him &quot;Esotérik Satie&quot;. From this period comes &quot;Ogives&quot;, a set of four piano pieces inspired by Gregorian chant and Gothic church architecture.

Keen to leave the Conservatoire, Satie volunteered for military service, and joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment in November 1886. He quickly found army life no more to his liking than the Conservatoire, and deliberately contracted acute bronchitis by standing in the open, bare-chested, on a winter night. After three months&#x27; convalescence he was invalided out of the army.

===Montmartre===
In 1887, at the age of 21, Satie moved from his father&#x27;s residence to lodgings in the 9th arrondissement. By this time he had started what was to be an enduring friendship with the romantic poet Contamine de Latour, whose verse he set in some of his early compositions, which Satie senior published. His lodgings were close to the popular cabaret on the southern edge of Montmartre where he became an habitué and then a resident pianist. The Chat Noir was known as the &quot;temple de la &#x27;convention farfelue&#x27;&quot; – the temple of zany convention, and as the biographer Robert Orledge puts it, Satie, &quot;free from his restrictive upbringing … enthusiastically embraced the reckless bohemian lifestyle and created for himself a new persona as a long-haired man-about-town in frock coat and top hat&quot;. This was the first of several personas that Satie invented for himself over the years.

In the late 1880s Satie styled himself on at least one occasion &quot;Erik Satie – gymnopédiste&quot;, and his works from this period include the three &quot;Gymnopédies&quot; (1888) and the first &quot;Gnossiennes&quot; (1889 and 1890). He earned a modest living as pianist and conductor at the Chat Noir, before falling out with the proprietor and moving to become second pianist at the nearby Auberge du Clou. There he became a close friend of Claude Debussy, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition. Both were bohemians, enjoying the same café society and struggling to survive financially. At the Auberge du Clou Satie first encountered the flamboyant, self-styled &quot;Sâr&quot; Joséphin Péladan, for whose mystic sect, the Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique du Temple et du Graal, he was appointed composer. This gave him scope for experiment, and Péladan&#x27;s salons at the fashionable Galerie Durand-Ruel gained Satie his first public hearings. Frequently short of money, Satie moved from his lodgings in the 9th arrondissement to a small room in the rue Cortot not far from Sacre-Coeur, so high up the Butte Montmartre that he said he could see from his window all the way to the Belgian border.

By mid-1892, Satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own making (&#x27;), provided incidental music to a chivalric esoteric play (two &#x27;), had a hoax published (announcing the premiere of his non-existent &quot;, an anti-Wagnerian opera), and broken away from Péladan, starting that autumn with the &quot;Uspud&quot;&quot; project, a &quot;Christian Ballet&quot;, in collaboration with Latour. He challenged the musical establishment by proposing himself – unsuccessfully – for the seat in the Académie des Beaux-Arts made vacant by the death of Ernest Guiraud. Between 1893 and 1895, Satie, affecting a quasi-priestly dress, was the founder and only member of the Eglise Métropolitaine d&#x27;Art de Jésus Conducteur. From his &quot;Abbatiale&quot; in the rue Cortot, he published scathing attacks on his artistic enemies.

In 1893 Satie had what is believed to be his only love affair, a five-month liaison with the painter Suzanne Valadon. After their first night together, he proposed marriage. The two did not marry, but Valadon moved to a room next to Satie&#x27;s at the rue Cortot. Satie became obsessed with her, calling her his Biqui and writing impassioned notes about &quot;her whole being, lovely eyes, gentle hands, and tiny feet&quot;. During their relationship Satie composed the &quot;Danses gothiques&quot; as a means of calming his mind, and Valadon painted his portrait, which she gave him. After five months she moved away, leaving him devastated. He said later that he was left with &quot;nothing but an icy loneliness that fills the head with emptiness and the heart with sadness&quot;.

In 1895 Satie attempted to change his image once again: this time to that of &quot;the Velvet Gentleman&quot;. From the proceeds of a small legacy, he bought seven identical dun-coloured suits. Orledge comments that this change &quot;marked the end of his Rose+Croix period and the start of a long search for a new artistic direction&quot;.

===Move to Arcueil===

In 1898, in search of somewhere cheaper and quieter than Montmartre, Satie moved to a room in the southern suburbs, in the commune of Arcueil-Cachan, eight kilometres (five miles) from the centre of Paris. This remained his home for the rest of his life. No visitors were ever admitted. He joined a radical socialist party (he later switched his membership to the Communist Party), but adopted a thoroughly bourgeois image: the biographer Pierre-Daniel Templier, writes, &quot;With his umbrella and bowler hat, he resembled a quiet school teacher. Although a Bohemian, he looked very dignified, almost ceremonious&quot;.

Satie earned a living as a cabaret pianist, adapting more than a hundred compositions of popular music for piano or piano and voice, adding some of his own. The most popular of these were &#x27;, text by Henry Pacory; &#x27;, text by Vincent Hyspa; &#x27;, a waltz; &quot;La Diva de l&#x27;Empire&quot;, text by Dominique Bonnaud/Numa Blès; &#x27;, a march; &#x27;, text by Contamine de Latour (lost, but the music later reappears in &#x27;); and others. In his later years Satie rejected all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature. Only a few compositions that he took seriously remain from this period: &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;, music to a pantomime by Jules Depaquit (called a &quot;&quot; by Satie); &#x27;, a short comic opera to a text by &quot;Lord Cheminot&quot; (Latour); &#x27; (&quot;The Dreamy Fish&quot;), piano music to accompany a lost tale by Cheminot, and a few others that were mostly incomplete. Few were presented, and none published at the time.
A decisive change in Satie&#x27;s musical outlook came after he heard the premiere of Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in 1902. He found it &quot;absolutely astounding&quot;, and he re-evaluated his own music. In a determined attempt to improve his technique, and against Debussy&#x27;s advice, he enrolled as a mature student at Paris&#x27;s second main music academy, the Schola Cantorum in October 1905, continuing his studies there until 1912. The institution was run by Vincent d&#x27;Indy, who emphasised orthodox technique rather than creative originality. Satie studied counterpoint with Albert Roussel and composition with d&#x27;Indy, and was a much more conscientious and successful student than he had been at the Conservatoire in his youth.

It was not until 1911, when he was in his mid-forties, that Satie came to the notice of the musical public in general. In January of that year Maurice Ravel played some early Satie works at a concert by the Société musicale indépendante, a forward-looking group set up by Ravel and others as a rival to the conservative Société nationale de musique. Satie was suddenly seen as &quot;the precursor and apostle of the musical revolution now taking place&quot;; he became a focus for young composers. Debussy, having orchestrated the first and third &quot;Gymnopédies&quot;, conducted them in concert. The publisher Demets asked for new works from Satie, who was finally able to give up his cabaret work and devote himself to composition. Works such as the cycle &quot;Sports et divertissements&quot; (1914) were published in de luxe editions. The press began to write about Satie&#x27;s music, and a leading pianist, Ricardo Viñes, took him up, giving celebrated first performances of some Satie pieces.
===Last years===
Satie became the focus of successive groups of young composers, whom he first encouraged and then distanced himself from, sometimes rancorously, when their popularity threatened to eclipse his or they otherwise displeased him. First were the &quot;jeunes&quot; – those associated with Ravel – and then a group known at first as the &quot;nouveaux jeunes&quot;, later called Les Six, including Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, and Germaine Tailleferre, joined later by Francis Poulenc and Darius Milhaud. Satie dissociated himself from the second group in 1918, and in the 1920s he became the focal point of another set of young composers including Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, Roger Désormière, Maxime Jacob and Henri Sauguet, who became known as the &quot;Arcueil School&quot;. In addition to turning against Ravel, Auric and Poulenc in particular, Satie quarrelled with his old friend Debussy in 1917, resentful of the latter&#x27;s failure to appreciate the more recent Satie compositions. The rupture lasted for the remaining months of Debussy&#x27;s life, and when he died the following year, Satie refused to attend the funeral. A few of his protégés escaped his displeasure, and Milhaud and Désormière were among those who remained friends with him to the last.

The First World War restricted concert-giving to some extent, but Orledge comments that the war years brought &quot;Satie&#x27;s second lucky break&quot;, when Jean Cocteau heard Viñes and Satie perform the &quot;Trois morceaux&quot; in 1916. This led to the commissioning of the ballet &quot;Parade&quot;, premiered in 1917 by Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine. This was a &quot;succès de scandale&quot;, with jazz rhythms and instrumentation including parts for typewriter, steamship whistle and siren. It firmly established Satie&#x27;s name before the public, and thereafter his career centred on the theatre, writing mainly to commission.

In October 1916 Satie received a commission from the Princesse de Polignac that resulted in what Orledge rates as the composer&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Socrate&quot;, two years later. Satie set translations from Plato&#x27;s Dialogues as a &quot;symphonic drama&quot;. Its composition was interrupted in 1917 by a libel suit brought against him by a music critic, Jean Poueigh, which nearly resulted in a jail sentence for Satie. When &quot;Socrate&quot; was premiered, Satie called it &quot;a return to classical simplicity with a modern sensibility&quot;, and among those who admired the work was Igor Stravinsky, a composer whom Satie regarded with awe.

In his later years Satie became known for his prose. He was in demand as a journalist, making contributions to the &quot;Revue musicale&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit nouveau&quot;, the &quot;Paris-Journal&quot; and other publications from the Dadaist &quot;391&quot; to the English-language magazines &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The Transatlantic Review&quot;. As he contributed anonymously or under pen names to some publications it is not certain how many titles he wrote for, but &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; lists 25. Satie&#x27;s habit of embellishing the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks became so established that he had to insist that they must not be read out during performances.

In 1920 there was a festival of Satie&#x27;s music at the Salle Erard in Paris. In 1924 the ballets &quot;Mercure&quot; (with choreography by Massine and décor by Picasso) and &quot;Relâche&quot; (&quot;Cancelled&quot;) (in collaboration with Francis Picabia and René Clair), both provoked headlines with their first night scandals. 

Despite being a musical iconoclast, and encourager of modernism, Satie was uninterested to the point of antipathy about innovations such as the telephone, the gramophone and the radio. He made no recordings, and as far as is known heard only a single radio broadcast (of Milhaud&#x27;s music) and made only one telephone call. Although his personal appearance was customarily immaculate, his room at Arcueil was in Orledge&#x27;s word &quot;squalid&quot;, and after his death the scores of several important works believed lost were found among the accumulated rubbish. He was incompetent with money. Having depended to a considerable extent on the generosity of friends in his early years, he was little better off when he began to earn a good income from his compositions, as he spent or gave away money as soon as he received it. He liked children, and they liked him, but his relations with adults were seldom straightforward. One of his last collaborators, Picabia, said of him:

Throughout his adult life Satie was a heavy drinker, and in 1925 his health collapsed. He was taken to the Hôpital Saint-Joseph in Paris, diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. He died there at 8.00 p.m. on 1 July, at the age of 59. He was buried in the cemetery at Arcueil.

==Works==

===Music===

In the view of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Music&quot;, Satie&#x27;s importance lay in &quot;directing a new generation of French composers away from Wagner‐influenced impressionism towards a leaner, more epigrammatic style&quot;. Debussy christened him &quot;the precursor&quot; because of his early harmonic innovations. Satie summed up his musical philosophy in 1917:


Among his earliest compositions were sets of three &quot;Gymnopédies&quot; (1888) and his &quot;Gnossiennes&quot; (1889 onwards) for piano. They evoke the ancient world by what the critics Roger Nichols and Paul Griffiths describe as &quot;pure simplicity, monotonous repetition, and highly original modal harmonies&quot;.
It is possible that their simplicity and originality were influenced by Debussy; it is also possible that it was Satie who influenced Debussy. During the brief spell when Satie was composer to Péladan&#x27;s sect he adopted a similarly austere manner.

While Satie was earning his living as a café pianist in Montmartre he contributed songs and little waltzes. After moving to Arcueil he began to write works with quirky titles, such as the seven-movement suite &quot;Trois morceaux en forme de poire&quot; (&quot;Three Pear-shaped Pieces&quot;) for piano four-hands (1903), simply-phrased music that Nichols and Griffiths describe as &quot;a résumé of his music since 1890&quot; – reusing some of his earlier work as well as popular songs of the time. He struggled to find his own musical voice. Orledge writes that this was partly because of his &quot;trying to ape his illustrious peers … we find bits of Ravel in his miniature opera &quot;Geneviève de Brabant&quot; and echoes of both Fauré and Debussy in the &quot;Nouvelles pièces froides&quot; of 1907&quot;.

After concluding his studies at the Schola Cantorum in 1912 Satie composed with greater confidence and more prolifically. Orchestration, despite his studies with d&#x27;Indy, was never his strongest suit, but his grasp of counterpoint is evident in the opening bars of &quot;Parade&quot;, and from the outset of his composing career he had original and distinctive ideas about harmony. In his later years he composed sets of short instrumental works with absurd titles, including &quot;Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien)&quot; (&quot;True Flabby Preludes (for a Dog)&quot;, 1912), &quot;Croquis et agaceries d&#x27;un gros bonhomme en bois&quot; (&quot;Sketches and Exasperations of a Big Wooden Man&quot;, 1913) and &quot;Sonatine bureaucratique&quot; (&quot;Bureaucratic Sonata&quot;, 1917). 
In his neat, calligraphic hand, Satie would write extensive instructions for his performers, and although his words appear at first sight to be humorous and deliberately nonsensical, Nichols and Griffiths comment, &quot;a sensitive pianist can make much of injunctions such as &#x27;arm yourself with clairvoyance&#x27; and &#x27;with the end of your thought&#x27;&quot;. His &quot;Sonatine bureaucratique&quot; anticipates the neoclassicism soon adopted by Stravinsky. Despite his rancorous falling out with Debussy, Satie commemorated his long-time friend in 1920, two years after Debussy&#x27;s death, in the anguished &quot;Elégie&quot;, the first of the miniature song cycle &quot;Quatre petites mélodies&quot;. Orledge rates the cycle as the finest, though least known, of the four sets of short songs of Satie&#x27;s last decade.

Satie invented what he called &quot;Musique d&#x27;ameublement&quot; – &quot;furniture music&quot; – a kind of background not to be listened to consciously. &quot;Cinéma&quot;, composed for the René Clair film &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot;, shown between the acts of &quot;Relâche&quot; (1924), is an example of early film music designed to be unconsciously absorbed rather than carefully listened to.

Satie is regarded by some writers as an influence on minimalism, which developed in the 1960s and later. The musicologist Mark Bennett and the composer Humphrey Searle have said that John Cage&#x27;s music shows Satie&#x27;s influence, and Searle and the writer Edward Strickland have used the term &quot;minimalism&quot; in connection with Satie&#x27;s &quot;Vexations&quot;, which the composer implied in his manuscript should be played over and over again 840 times. John Adams included a specific homage to Satie&#x27;s music in his 1996 &quot;Century Rolls&quot;.

===Writings===

Satie wrote extensively for the press, but unlike his professional colleagues such as Debussy and Dukas he did not write primarily as a music critic. Much of his writing is connected to music tangentially if at all. His biographer Caroline Potter describes him as &quot;an experimental creative writer, a &quot;blagueur&quot; who provoked, mystified and amused his readers&quot;. He wrote &quot;jeux d&#x27;esprit&quot; claiming to eat dinner in four minutes with a diet of exclusively white food (including bones and fruit mould), or to drink boiled wine mixed with fuchsia juice, or to be woken by a servant hourly throughout the night to have his temperature taken; he wrote in praise of Beethoven&#x27;s non-existent but &quot;sumptuous&quot; Tenth Symphony, and the family of instruments known as the cephalophones, &quot;which have a compass of thirty octaves and are absolutely unplayable&quot;.

Satie grouped some of these writings under the general headings &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;un mammifère&quot; (A Mammal&#x27;s Notebook) and &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un amnésique&quot; (Memoirs of an Amnesiac), indicating, as Potter comments, that &quot;these are not autobiographical writings in the conventional manner&quot;. He claimed the major influence on his humour was Oliver Cromwell, adding &quot;I also owe much to Christopher Columbus, because the American spirit has occasionally tapped me on the shoulder and I have been delighted to feel its ironically glacial bite&quot;.

His published writings include:
* &quot;A Mammal&#x27;s Notebook: Collected Writings of Erik Satie&quot; (Serpent&#x27;s Tail; Atlas Arkhive, No 5, 1997) (with introduction and notes by Ornella Volta, translations by Anthony Melville, contains several drawings by Satie)
* &quot;&quot; (Paris: Fayard/Imes, 2000; 1265 pages) (an almost complete edition of Satie&#x27;s letters, in French)

<text>In integral calculus, an elliptic integral is one of a number of related functions defined as the value of certain integrals, which were first studied by Giulio Fagnano and Leonhard Euler (). Their name originates from their originally arising in connection with the problem of finding the arc length of an ellipse.

Modern mathematics defines an &quot;elliptic integral&quot; as any function which can be expressed in the form

formula_1

where is a rational function of its two arguments, is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4 with no repeated roots, and is a constant.

In general, integrals in this form cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Exceptions to this general rule are when has repeated roots, or when contains no odd powers of or if the integral is pseudo-elliptic. However, with the appropriate reduction formula, every elliptic integral can be brought into a form that involves integrals over rational functions and the three Legendre canonical forms, also known as the elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind.

Besides the Legendre form given below, the elliptic integrals may also be expressed in Carlson symmetric form. Additional insight into the theory of the elliptic integral may be gained through the study of the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping. Historically, elliptic functions were discovered as inverse functions of elliptic integrals.

==Argument notation==
&quot;Incomplete elliptic integrals&quot; are functions of two arguments; &quot;complete elliptic integrals&quot; are functions of a single argument. These arguments are expressed in a variety of different but equivalent ways as they give the same elliptic integral. Most texts adhere to a canonical naming scheme, using the following naming conventions.

For expressing one argument:
* , the &quot;modular angle&quot;
* , the &quot;elliptic modulus&quot; or &quot;eccentricity&quot;
* , the &quot;parameter&quot;

Each of the above three quantities is completely determined by any of the others (given that they are non-negative). Thus, they can be used interchangeably.

The other argument can likewise be expressed as , the &quot;amplitude&quot;, or as or , where and is one of the Jacobian elliptic functions.

Specifying the value of any one of these quantities determines the others. Note that also depends on . Some additional relationships involving include
formula_2

The latter is sometimes called the &quot;delta amplitude&quot; and written as . Sometimes the literature also refers to the &quot;complementary parameter&quot;, the &quot;complementary modulus,&quot; or the &quot;complementary modular angle&quot;. These are further defined in the article on quarter periods.

In this notation, the use of a vertical bar as delimiter indicates that the argument following it is the &quot;parameter&quot; (as defined above), while the backslash indicates that it is the modular angle. The use of a semicolon implies that the argument preceding it is the sine of the amplitude:
formula_3
This potentially confusing use of different argument delimiters is traditional in elliptic integrals and much of the notation is compatible with that used in the reference book by Abramowitz and Stegun and that used in the integral tables by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik.

There are still other conventions for the notation of elliptic integrals employed in the literature. The notation with interchanged arguments, , is often encountered; and similarly for the integral of the second kind. Abramowitz and Stegun substitute the integral of the first kind, , for the argument in their definition of the integrals of the second and third kinds, unless this argument is followed by a vertical bar: i.e. for . Moreover, their complete integrals employ the &quot;parameter&quot; as argument in place of the modulus , i.e. rather than . And the integral of the third kind defined by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, , puts the amplitude first and not the &quot;characteristic&quot; .

Thus one must be careful with the notation when using these functions, because various reputable references and software packages use different conventions in the definitions of the elliptic functions. For example, Wolfram&#x27;s Mathematica software and Wolfram Alpha define the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in terms of the parameter , instead of the elliptic modulus .

==Incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind==
The incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined as

formula_4

This is Legendre&#x27;s trigonometric form of the elliptic integral; substituting and , one obtains Jacobi&#x27;s algebraic form:

formula_5

Equivalently, in terms of the amplitude and modular angle one has:
formula_6

With one has:
formula_7
demonstrating that this Jacobian elliptic function is a simple inverse of the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind.

The incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind has following addition theorem:
formula_8

The elliptic modulus can be transformed that way:
formula_9

==Incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind==
The incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind in Legendre&#x27;s trigonometric form is

formula_10

Substituting and , one obtains Jacobi&#x27;s algebraic form:

formula_11

Equivalently, in terms of the amplitude and modular angle:
formula_12

Relations with the Jacobi elliptic functions include
formula_13

The meridian arc length from the equator to latitude is written in terms of :
formula_14
where is the semi-major axis, and is the eccentricity.

The incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind has following addition theorem:
formula_15

The elliptic modulus can be transformed that way:
formula_16

==Incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind==
The incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind is 
formula_17

or

formula_18

The number is called the characteristic and can take on any value, independently of the other arguments. Note though that the value is infinite, for any .

A relation with the Jacobian elliptic functions is
formula_19

The meridian arc length from the equator to latitude is also related to a special case of :

formula_20

==Complete elliptic integral of the first kind==
Elliptic Integrals are said to be &#x27;complete&#x27; when the amplitude and therefore . The complete elliptic integral of the first kind may thus be defined as
formula_21
or more compactly in terms of the incomplete integral of the first kind as
formula_22

It can be expressed as a power series
formula_23

where is the Legendre polynomials, which is equivalent to

formula_24

where denotes the double factorial. In terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind can be expressed as

formula_25

The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is sometimes called the quarter period. It can be computed very efficiently in terms of the arithmetic–geometric mean:
formula_26

Therefore, the modulus can be transformed as:

formula_27

This expression is valid for all formula_28 and :

formula_29

===Relation to the gamma function===
If and formula_30 (where is the modular lambda function), then is expressible in closed form in terms of the gamma function. For example, , and give, respectively,

formula_31

and

formula_32

and

formula_33

More generally, the condition that
formula_34
be in an imaginary quadratic field is sufficient. For instance, if , then and

formula_35

===Asymptotic expressions===
formula_36
This approximation has a relative precision better than for . Keeping only the first two terms is correct to 0.01 precision for .

===Differential equation===
The differential equation for the elliptic integral of the first kind is
formula_37

A second solution to this equation is formula_38. This solution satisfies the relation
formula_39

===Continued fraction===
A continued fraction expansion is: 
formula_40
where the nome is formula_41 in its definition.

===Inverting the period ratio===
Here, we use the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with the &quot;parameter&quot; formula_42 instead, because the squaring function introduces problems when inverting in the complex plane. So let
:formula_43
and let
:formula_44
:formula_45
be the theta functions.

The equation
:formula_46
can then be solved (provided that a solution formula_42 exists) by
:formula_48
which is in fact the modular lambda function.

For the purposes of computation, the error analysis is given by
:formula_49
:formula_50
where formula_51 and formula_52.

Also
:formula_53
where formula_54.

==Complete elliptic integral of the second kind==


The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as

formula_55

or more compactly in terms of the incomplete integral of the second kind as

formula_56

For an ellipse with semi-major axis and semi-minor axis and eccentricity , the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is equal to one quarter of the circumference of the ellipse measured in units of the semi-major axis . In other words:

formula_57

The complete elliptic integral of the second kind can be expressed as a power series

formula_58

which is equivalent to

formula_59

In terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function, the complete elliptic integral of the second kind can be expressed as

formula_60

The modulus can be transformed that way:
formula_61

===Computation===

Like the integral of the first kind, the complete elliptic integral of the second kind can be computed very efficiently using the arithmetic–geometric mean.

Define sequences and , where , and the recurrence relations , hold. Furthermore, define
formula_62

By definition,

formula_63

Also

formula_64

Then

formula_65

In practice, the arithmetic-geometric mean would simply be computed up to some limit. This formula converges quadratically for all . To speed up computation further, the relation can be used.

Furthermore, if and formula_30 (where is the modular lambda function), then is expressible in closed form in terms of
formula_67
and hence can be computed without the need for the infinite summation term. For example, , and give, respectively,

formula_68

and

formula_69

and

formula_70

===Derivative and differential equation===
formula_71
formula_72

A second solution to this equation is .

==Complete elliptic integral of the third kind==

The complete elliptic integral of the third kind can be defined as

formula_73

Note that sometimes the elliptic integral of the third kind is defined with an inverse sign for the &quot;characteristic&quot; ,
formula_74

Just like the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, the complete elliptic integral of the third kind can be computed very efficiently using the arithmetic-geometric mean.

===Partial derivatives===
formula_75

==Jacobi zeta function==
In 1829, Jacobi defined the Jacobi zeta function:
formula_76
It is periodic in formula_77 with minimal period formula_78. It is related to the Jacobi zn function by formula_79. In the literature (e.g. Whittaker and Watson (1927)), sometimes formula_80 means Wikipedia&#x27;s formula_81. Some authors (e.g. King (1924)) use formula_80 for both Wikipedia&#x27;s formula_80 and formula_81.

==Legendre&#x27;s relation==

The Legendre&#x27;s relation or &quot;Legendre Identity&quot; shows the relation of the integrals K and E of an elliptic modulus and its anti-related counterpart in an integral equation of second degree:

For two modules that are Pythagorean counterparts to each other, this relation is valid:

formula_85

For example:
: formula_86

And for two modules that are tangential counterparts to each other, the following relationship is valid:

: formula_87

For example:
: formula_88

The Legendre&#x27;s relation for tangential modular counterparts results directly from the Legendre&#x27;s identity for Pythagorean modular counterparts by using the Landen modular transformation on the Pythagorean counter modulus.

=== Special identity for the lemniscatic case ===
For the lemniscatic case, the elliptic modulus or specific eccentricity ε is equal to half the square root of two. Legendre&#x27;s identity for the lemniscatic case can be proved as follows:

According to the Chain rule these derivatives hold:

: formula_89
: formula_90

By using the Fundamental theorem of calculus these formulas can be generated:

: formula_91
: formula_92

The Linear combination of the two now mentioned integrals leads to the following formula:

: formula_93
: formula_94

By forming the original antiderivative related to x from the function now shown using the Product rule this formula results:

: formula_95
: formula_96

If the value formula_97 is inserted in this integral identity, then the following identity emerges:

: formula_98

: formula_99

This is how this lemniscatic excerpt from Legendre&#x27;s identity appears:

=== Generalization for the overall case ===
Now the modular general case is worked out. For this purpose, the derivatives of the complete elliptic integrals are derived after the modulus formula_101 and then they are combined. And then the Legendre&#x27;s identity balance is determined.

Because the derivative of the &quot;circle function&quot; is the negative product of the &quot;identical mapping function&quot; and the reciprocal of the circle function:

: formula_102

These are the derivatives of K and E shown in this article in the sections above:

: formula_103
: formula_104

In combination with the derivative of the circle function these derivatives are valid then:

: formula_105
: formula_106

Legendre&#x27;s identity includes products of any two complete elliptic integrals. For the derivation of the function side from the equation scale of Legendre&#x27;s identity, the Product rule is now applied in the following:

: formula_107
: formula_108
: formula_109

Of these three equations, adding the top two equations and subtracting the bottom equation gives this result:

: formula_110

In relation to the formula_101 the equation balance constantly gives the value zero.

The previously determined result shall be combined with the Legendre equation to the modulus formula_112 that is worked out in the section before:

: formula_100

The combination of the last two formulas gives the following result:

: formula_114

Because if the derivative of a continuous function constantly takes the value zero, then the concerned function is a constant function. This means that this function results in the same function value for each abscissa value formula_101 and the associated function graph is therefore a horizontal straight line.

<doc id="9961" wikidata="Q48203" url="?curid=9961" title="Epistle to the Romans">
<text>The Epistle to the Romans is the sixth book in the New Testament, and the longest of the thirteen Pauline epistles. Biblical scholars agree that it was composed by Paul the Apostle to explain that salvation is offered through the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Romans was likely written while Paul was staying in the house of Gaius in Corinth. The epistle was probably transcribed by Paul&#x27;s amanuensis Tertius and is dated AD late 55 to early 57. Ultimately consisting of 16 chapters, versions of the epistle with only the first 14 or 15 chapters circulated early. Some of these recensions lacked all reference to the original audience of Christians in Rome, making it very general in nature. Other textual variants include subscripts explicitly mentioning Corinth as the place of composition and name Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, as the messenger who took the epistle to Rome.

Prior to composing the epistle, Paul had evangelized the areas surrounding the Aegean Sea and was eager to take the gospel farther to Spain, a journey that would allow him to visit Rome on the way. The epistle can consequently be understood as a document outlining his reasons for the trip and preparing the church in Rome for his visit. Christians in Rome would have been of both Jewish and Gentile background and it is possible that the church suffered from internal strife between these two groups. Paul – a Hellenistic Jew and former Pharisee – shifts his argument to cater to both audiences and the church as a whole. Because the work contains material intended both for specific recipients as well as the general Christian public in Rome, scholars have had difficulty categorizing it as either a private letter or a public epistle.

Although sometimes considered a treatise of (systematic) theology, Romans remains silent on many issues that Paul addresses elsewhere, but is nonetheless generally considered substantial, especially on justification and salvation. Proponents of both &quot;sola fide&quot; and the Roman Catholic position of the necessity of both faith and works find support in Romans. Martin Luther in his translation of the Bible controversially added the word &quot;alone&quot; ( in German) to Romans so that it read: &quot;thus, we hold, then, that man is justified without doing the works of the law, through faith&quot;.

== General presentation ==
In the opinion of Jesuit biblical scholar Joseph Fitzmyer, the book &quot;overwhelms the reader by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of the justification and salvation of Jew and Greek alike by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, revealing the uprightness and love of God the Father.&quot;

Anglican bishop N. T. Wright notes that Romans is:
== Authorship and dating ==
The scholarly consensus is that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Romans. C. E. B. Cranfield, in the introduction to his commentary on Romans, says:

The letter was most probably written while Paul was in Corinth, probably while he was staying in the house of Gaius, and transcribed by Tertius, his amanuensis. There are a number of reasons why Corinth is considered most plausible. Paul was about to travel to Jerusalem on writing the letter, which matches Acts where it is reported that Paul stayed for three months in Greece. This probably implies Corinth as it was the location of Paul&#x27;s greatest missionary success in Greece. Additionally, Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, a port to the east of Corinth, and would have been able to convey the letter to Rome after passing through Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth&#x27;s west port. Erastus, mentioned in Romans 16:23, also lived in Corinth, being the city&#x27;s commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in Corinth.

The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the collection for Jerusalem had been assembled and Paul was about to &quot;go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints&quot;, that is, at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city. The majority of scholars writing on Romans propose the letter was written in late 55/early 56 or late 56/early 57. Early 55 and early 58 both have some support, while German New Testament scholar Gerd Lüdemann argues for a date as early as 51/52 (or 54/55), following on from Knox, who proposed 53/54. Lüdemann is the only serious challenge to the consensus of mid to late 50s.

== Textual variants ==
=== Fourteen-chapter form ===
There is strong, albeit indirect, evidence that a recension of Romans that lacked chapters 15 and 16 was widely used in the western half of the Roman Empire until the mid-4th century. This conclusion is partially based on the fact that a variety of Church Fathers, such as Origen and Tertullian, refer to a fourteen-chapter edition of Romans, either directly or indirectly. The fact that Paul&#x27;s doxology is placed in various different places in different manuscripts of Romans only strengthens the case for an early fourteen-chapter recension. While there is some uncertainty, Harry Gamble concludes that the canonical sixteen-chapter recension is likely the earlier version of the text.

The Codex Boernerianus lacks the explicit references to the Roman church as the audience of the epistle found in Romans 1:7 and 1:15. There is evidence from patristic commentaries indicating that Boernerianus is not unique in this regard; many early, no longer extant manuscripts also lacked an explicit Roman addressee in chapter 1. It is notable that, when this textual variant is combined with the omission of chapters 15 and 16, there is no longer any clear reference to the Roman church throughout the entire epistle. Harry Gamble speculates that 1:7, 1:15, and chapters 15 and 16 may have been removed by a scribe in order to make the epistle more suitable for a &quot;general&quot; audience.

=== Fifteen-chapter form ===
It is quite possible that a fifteen-chapter form of Romans, omitting chapter 16, may have existed at an early date. Several scholars have argued, largely on the basis of internal evidence, that Chapter 16 represents a separate letter of Paul – possibly addressed to Ephesus – that was later appended to Romans.

There are a few different arguments for this conclusion. First of all, there is a concluding peace benediction at 15:33, which reads like the other Pauline benedictions that conclude their respective letters. Secondly, Paul greets a large number of people and families in chapter 16, in a way that suggests he was already familiar with them, whereas the material of chapters 1–15 presupposes that Paul has never met anyone from the Roman church. The fact that Papyrus 46 places Paul&#x27;s doxology at the end of chapter 15 can also be interpreted as evidence for the existence of a fifteen-chapter recension of the epistle.

=== Subscript ===
Some manuscripts have a subscript at the end of the Epistle:
* (&quot;to the Romans&quot;) is found in these manuscripts: Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, Codex Claromontanus;
* (&quot;to the Romans it was written from Corinth&quot;): B, D (P);
* (&quot;to the Romans it was written from Corinth by Phoebe the deacon&quot;): 42, 90, 216, 339, 462, 466*, 642;
* (&quot;the epistle to the Romans was written by Tertius and was sent by Phoebe from the Corinthians of the church in Cenchreae&quot;): only in 337;
* (&quot;to the Romans it was written from Corinth by Phoebe the deacon of the church in Cenchreae&quot;): 101, 241, 460, 466, 469, 602, 603, 605, 618, 1923, 1924, 1927, 1932, followed by Textus Receptus.

== Paul&#x27;s life in relation to his epistle ==

For ten years before writing the letter ( AD), Paul had traveled around the territories bordering the Aegean Sea evangelizing. Churches had been planted in the Roman provinces of Galatia, Macedonia, Achaia and Asia. Paul, considering his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in Spain, where he would not &quot;build upon another man&#x27;s foundation&quot;. This allowed him to visit Rome on the way, a long-time ambition of his. The letter to the Romans, in part, prepares them and gives reasons for his visit.

In addition to Paul&#x27;s geographic location, his religious views are important. First, Paul was a Hellenistic Jew with a Pharisaic background (see Gamaliel), integral to his identity (see Paul the Apostle and Judaism). His concern for his people is one part of the dialogue and runs throughout the letter. Second, the other side of the dialogue is Paul&#x27;s conversion and calling to follow Christ in the early 30s.

== The churches in Rome ==

The most probable ancient account of the beginning of Christianity in Rome is given by a 4th-century writer known as Ambrosiaster:

From Adam Clarke:
At this time, the Jews made up a substantial number in Rome, and their synagogues, frequented by many, enabled the Gentiles to become acquainted with the story of Jesus of Nazareth. Consequently, churches composed of both Jews and Gentiles were formed at Rome. According to Irenaeus, a 2nd-century Church Father, the church at Rome was founded directly by the apostles Peter and Paul. However, many modern scholars disagree with Irenaeus, holding that while little is known of the circumstances of the church&#x27;s founding, it was not founded by Paul:

The large number of names in Romans 16:3–15 of those then in Rome, and verses 5, 15 and 16, indicate there was more than one church assembly or company of believers in Rome. Verse 5 mentions a church that met in the house of Aquila and Priscilla. Verses 14 and 15 each mention groupings of believers and saints.

Jews were expelled from Rome because of disturbances around AD 49 by the edict of Claudius. Fitzmyer claims that both Jews and Jewish Christians were expelled as a result of their infighting. Claudius died around the year AD 54, and his successor, Emperor Nero, allowed the Jews back into Rome, but then, after the Great Fire of Rome of 64, Christians were persecuted. Fitzmyer argues that with the return of the Jews to Rome in 54 new conflict arose between the Gentile Christians and the Jewish Christians who had formerly been expelled. He also argues that this may be what Paul is referring to when he talks about the &quot;strong&quot; and the &quot;weak&quot; in Romans 15; this theory was originally put forth by W. Marxsen in &quot;Introduction to the New Testament: An Approach to its problems&quot; (1968) but is critiqued and modified by Fitzmyer. Fitzmyer&#x27;s main contention is that Paul seems to be purposefully vague. Paul could have been more specific if he wanted to address this problem specifically. Keck thinks Gentile Christians may have developed a dislike of or looked down on Jews (see also Antisemitism and Responsibility for the death of Jesus), because they theologically rationalized that Jews were no longer God&#x27;s people.

== Style ==
Scholars often have difficulty assessing whether Romans is a letter or an epistle, a relevant distinction in form-critical analysis:

Joseph Fitzmyer argues, from evidence put forth by Stirewalt, that the style of Romans is an &quot;essay-letter.&quot; Philip Melanchthon, a writer during the Reformation, suggested that Romans was (&quot;a summary of all Christian doctrine&quot;). While some scholars suggest, like Melanchthon, that it is a type of theological treatise, this view largely ignores chapters 14 and 15 of Romans. There are also many &quot;noteworthy elements&quot; missing from Romans that are included in other areas of the Pauline corpus. The breakdown of Romans as a treatise began with F.C. Baur in 1836 when he suggested &quot;this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical circumstances in which Paul wrote it.&quot;

Paul sometimes uses a style of writing common in his time called a diatribe. He appears to be responding to a critic (probably an imaginary one based on Paul&#x27;s encounters with real objections in his previous preaching), and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. In the flow of the letter, Paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the Jewish members of the church, sometimes the Gentile membership and sometimes the church as a whole.

== Purposes of writing ==
To review the current scholarly viewpoints on the purpose of Romans, along with a bibliography, see &quot;Dictionary of Paul and His Letters&quot;. For a 16th-century &quot;Lollard&quot; reformer view, see the work of William Tyndale. In his prologue to his translation of Romans, which was largely taken from the prologue of German Reformer Martin Luther, Tyndale writes that:
== Contents ==
=== Prologue (1:1–15) ===
====Greeting (1:1–7)====
The introduction provides some general notes about Paul. He introduces his apostleship here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to the church at Rome. Jesus&#x27; human line stems from David. Paul, however, does not limit his ministry to Jews. Paul&#x27;s goal is that the Gentiles would also hear the gospel.

====Prayer of Thanksgiving (1:8–15)====
He commends the Romans for faith. Paul also speaks of the past obstacles that have blocked his coming to Rome earlier.

=== Salvation in the Christ (1:16–8:39) ===

====Righteousness of God (1:16–17)====
Paul announces that he is not &quot;ashamed&quot; () of his gospel because it holds power (). These two verses form a backdrop of themes for the rest of the book; first, that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is speaking to the &quot;Jew first.&quot; There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship between Paul and Judaism is still debated, and scholars are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul&#x27;s former writings against the Judaizers in Galatians and 2 Corinthians, that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and Supersessionism). Paul may have used the &quot;Jew first&quot; approach to counter such a view.

====Condemnation: The Universal corruption of Gentiles and Jews (1:18–3:20)====
===== The judgment of God (1:18–32) =====
Paul begins with a summary of Hellenistic Jewish apologist discourse. His summary begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and wickedness for which there already is wrath from God. People have taken God&#x27;s invisible image and made him into an idol. Paul draws heavily here from the Wisdom of Solomon. This summary condemns &quot;unnatural sexual behavior&quot; and warns that such behavior has already resulted in a depraved body and mind (&quot;reprobate mind&quot; in the King James Version) and says that people who do such things (including murder and wickedness ) are worthy of death. Paul stands firmly against the idol worship system which was common in Rome. Several scholars believe the passage is a non-Pauline interpolation.

===== Paul&#x27;s warning of hypocrites (2:1–4) =====
On the traditional Protestant interpretation, Paul here calls out Jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they themselves are also not following the law. Stanley Stowers, however, has argued on rhetorical grounds that Paul is in these verses not addressing a Jew at all but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person (). Stowers writes, &quot;There is absolutely no justification for reading as Paul&#x27;s attack on &#x27;the hypocrisy of the Jew.&#x27; No one in the first century would have identified with Judaism. That popular interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later Christian characterizations of Jews as &#x27;hypocritical Pharisees. (See also Anti-Judaism).

==== Justification: The Gift of Grace and Forgiveness through Faith (3:21–5:11) ====
Paul says that a righteousness from God has made itself known apart from the law, to which the law and prophets testify, and this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe. He describes justification – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of God, and not the work of man (lest he might boast), but by faith.

==== Assurance of salvation (5–11) ====
In chapters five through eight, Paul argues that believers can be assured of their hope in salvation, having been freed from the bondage of sin. Paul teaches that through faith, the faithful have been joined with Jesus and freed from sin. Believers should celebrate in the assurance of salvation and be certain that no external force or party can take their salvation away from them. This promise is open to everyone since everyone has sinned, save the one who paid for all of them.

In , Paul says that humans are under the law while they live: &quot;Know ye not [...] that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?&quot; However, Jesus&#x27; death on the cross makes believers dead to the law (, &quot;Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the body of Christ&quot;), according to an antinomistic interpretation.

In Paul addresses the faithfulness of God to the Israelites, where he says that God has been faithful to his promise. Paul hopes that all Israelites will come to realize the truth, stating that &quot;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.&quot; Paul affirms that he himself is also an Israelite, and had in the past been a persecutor of Early Christians. In Paul talks about how the nation of Israel has not been cast away, and the conditions under which Israel will be God&#x27;s chosen nation again: when Israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief.

===Transformation of believers (12–15:13)===
From chapter 12 through the first part of chapter 15, Paul outlines how the gospel transforms believers and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. This transformation is described as a &quot;renewing of your mind&quot; (12:2), a transformation that Douglas J. Moo characterizes as &quot;the heart of the matter.&quot; It is a transformation so radical that it amounts to &quot;a transfiguration of your brain,&quot; a &quot;metanoia&quot;, a &quot;mental revolution.&quot;

Paul goes on to describe how believers should live. Christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of Moses, but under the grace of God (see Law and grace). Christians do not need to live under the law because to the extent that their minds have been renewed, they will know &quot;almost instinctively&quot; what God wants of them. The law then provides an &quot;objective standard&quot; for judging progress in the &quot;lifelong process&quot; of their mind&#x27;s renewal.

To the extent they have been set free from sin by renewed minds (Romans 6:18), believers are no longer bound to sin. Believers are free to live in obedience to God and love everybody. As Paul says in Romans 13:10, &quot;love () worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law&quot;.

==== Obedience to earthly powers (13:1–7) ====
The fragment in Romans 13:1–7 dealing with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example James Kallas, to be an interpolation. (See also the Great Commandment and Christianity and politics). Paul Tillich accepts the historical authenticity of Romans 13:1–7, but claims it has been misinterpreted by churches with an anti-revolutionary bias:
===Epilogue (15:1–16:23)===

* Admonition (15:1–7)
* Summary of the Epistle (15:8)

====Paul&#x27;s ministry and travel plans (16:14–27)====

The concluding verses contain a description of his travel plans, personal greetings and salutations. One-third of the twenty-one Christians identified in the greetings are women. Additionally, none of these Christians answer to the name Peter, although according to the Catholic tradition, he had been Pope in Rome for about 25 years. Possibly related was the Incident at Antioch between Paul and Cephas.
* Personal greetings (16:1–23 [24])
* Closing doxology (16:25–27)

== Hermeneutics ==
=== Catholic interpretation ===

Roman Catholics accept the necessity of faith for salvation but point to for the necessity of living a virtuous life as well:

Catholics would also look to the passage in Romans 8:13 for evidence that justification by faith is only valid so long as it is combined with obedient cooperation with The Holy Spirit, and the passage in Romans 11:22 to show that the Christian can lose their justification if they turn away from cooperating with The Holy Spirit and reject Christ through mortal sin.

=== Protestant interpretation ===
In the Protestant interpretation, the New Testament epistles (including Romans) describe salvation as coming from faith and not from righteous actions. For example, Romans (underlining added):

In the Protestant interpretation it is considered significant that in Romans , Paul says that God will reward those who follow the law and then goes on to say that follows the law perfectly (see also Sermon on the Mount: Interpretation) Romans :

Romans has been at the forefront of several major movements in Protestantism. Martin Luther&#x27;s lectures on Romans in 1515–1516 probably coincided with the development of his criticism of Roman Catholicism which led to the &quot;95 Theses&quot; of 1517. In the preface to his German translation of Romans, Luther described Paul&#x27;s letter to the Romans as &quot;the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian&#x27;s while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul&quot;. In 1738, while hearing Luther&#x27;s Preface to the Epistle to the Romans read at St. Botolph Church on Aldersgate Street in London, John Wesley famously felt his heart &quot;strangely warmed&quot;, a conversion experience which is often seen as the beginning of Methodism.

Luther controversially added the word &quot;alone&quot; ( in German) to Romans so that it read: &quot;thus, we hold, then, that man is justified without doing the works of the law, through faith&quot;. The word &quot;alone&quot; does not appear in the original Greek text, but Luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb &quot;alone&quot; was required both by idiomatic German and Paul&#x27;s intended meaning. This is a &quot;literalist view&quot; rather than a literal view of the Bible.

The &quot;Romans Road&quot; (or &quot;Roman Road&quot;) refers to a set of scriptures from Romans that Christian evangelists use to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation to each person, as all the verses are contained in one single book, making it easier for evangelism without going back and forth through the entire New Testament. The core verses used by nearly all groups using &quot;Romans Road&quot; are: Romans , , , , and .

<doc id="9962" wikidata="Q178525" url="?curid=9962" title="Eleanor of Aquitaine">
<text>Eleanor of Aquitaine (, , , ; – 1 April 1204) was Duchess of Aquitaine from 1137 to 1204, Queen of France from 1137 to 1152 as the wife of King Louis VII, and Queen of England from 1154 to 1189 as the wife of King Henry II. As the reigning duchess of Aquitaine, she ruled jointly with her husbands and two of her sons, the kings Richard I and John of England. As the heiress of the House of Poitiers, which controlled much of southwestern France, she was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Western Europe during the High Middle Ages.

The eldest child of William X, Duke of Aquitaine, and Aénor de Châtellerault, Eleanor became duchess upon her father&#x27;s death in 1137. Later that year, she married Louis, son of King Louis VI of France. Shortly afterwards, Eleanor&#x27;s father-in-law died and her husband became king, making her queen consort. Louis VII and Eleanor had two daughters, Marie and Alix. During the Second Crusade, Eleanor accompanied Louis to the Holy Land. An initial request in 1149 for an annulment of the marriage on grounds of consanguinity was rejected by Pope Eugene III. In 1152, after fifteen years of marriage, Eleanor had not borne a male heir, and the annulment was granted. Their daughters were declared legitimate, custody was awarded to Louis, and Eleanor&#x27;s lands were restored to her.

In the same year, Eleanor married Henry, Duke of Normandy. In 1154, following the death of King Stephen of England, Henry and Eleanor became king and queen of England. The couple had five sons and three daughters, but eventually became estranged. Henry imprisoned Eleanor for supporting the 1173 revolt against him by their sons Young Henry, Richard and Geoffrey. She was not released until 1189, when Henry II died and Richard I ascended the throne. As queen dowager, Eleanor acted as regent during Richard&#x27;s long absences from England and France. On Richard&#x27;s death in 1199, she successfully campaigned for his younger brother John to succeed him. After continuing turmoil between the French and English kings and the successive loss of the lands she and Henry II had once ruled over, she died in 1204 and was buried in Fontevraud Abbey in France.
== Life ==

Eleanor&#x27;s life can be considered as consisting of five distinct phases. Her early life extending to adolescence (1124–1137), marriage to Louis VII and Queen of France (1137–1152), marriage to Henry II and Queen of England (1152–1173), imprisonment to Henry&#x27;s death (1173–1189) and as a widow until her death (1189–1204).

=== Sources ===

There is a scarcity of primary sources on Eleanor&#x27;s life. There are no contemporary biographies, and modern biographies are largely drawn from annals and chronicles, generally written by clerics associated with the royal courts. There are very few surviving records from Aquitaine and she is barely mentioned in records of the French court, and appears to have been actively erased from memory. Consequently, accounts of Eleanor appear largely as a peripheral figure in chronicles of the men around her. Important secular sources from England and Wales include Roger of Howden (or Hoveden d. ), Walter Map (1130 – ), Ralph de Diceto (), Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis ) and Ralph Niger (). While some were relatively neutral, Map and Gerald were largely satirical polemic, while Niger&#x27;s criticisms are mainly directed at Henry II rather than Eleanor. Among the chroniclers are also clerical sources, including Gervase of Canterbury (), Ralph of Coggeshall (d. ), Richard of Devizes (fl. late 12th century), William of Newburgh (1136–1198) and Ranulf Higden (–1363 or 1364). The latter were mainly influenced by their revulsion at the murder of Thomas Becket (1170). Although Richard of Devizes admired Eleanor&#x27;s perseverance in supporting her son Richard, all of them expressed negative views about women in power and hinted at some darker attributes that eventually led to a &quot;Black Legend&quot; that became associated with her. Later, twentieth century writers such as Amy Kelly and Marion Meade would create an opposite myth that pervaded many subsequent accounts, of a feminist heroine, referred to as the &quot;Golden Myth&quot;, while in the French literature, similar treatment is seen in the work of Régine Pernoud. More recent scholarship has sought to correct both of these types of characterisation.

In the absence of reliable contemporary accounts, myth, legend and speculation have frequently been resorted to, to fill the gaps; &quot;rarely in the course of historical endeavor has so much been written, over so many centuries, about one woman of whom we know so little&quot;.

=== Childhood and adolescence (1124–1137) ===

==== Family origins and education ====

Eleanor was descended on her father&#x27;s side from a long dynastic line of Dukes of Aquitaine (all named William), dating back to the 10th century, who in turn succeeded the Carolingian monarchs of the Kingdom of Aquitaine. Twelfth century Aquitaine was a relatively vast and somewhat ill-defined area of modern-day France, stretching from the Loire in the north to the Pyrenees in the south, and from the Atlantic to the west to the Massif Central to the east. It was one of the wealthiest and most powerful vassal states within France at that time. In contrast, the French kings ruled over a relatively small area around the Île-de-France to the north-west, and the rulers of the surrounding duchies (&quot;s&quot;) and counties (&quot;s&quot;) gave only nominal allegiance to the French crown. While little is known of Eleanor&#x27;s early life or education, many biographers have speculated from what is known of aristocratic households of the era. Her year of birth is not known precisely, and the first mention of her occurs in July 1129. Tradition places her birth on one of her parents&#x27; visit to Bordeaux, likely at her father&#x27;s nearby castle at Belin. Other authors suggest Poitiers, Ombrière Palace, Bordeaux, or Nieul-sur-l&#x27;Autise. While the date of her birth was once given as 1122 or 1124, the latter is now generally accepted. A late 13th-century genealogy of her family listing her as 13 years old at her father&#x27;s death in the spring of 1137 provides the best evidence that Eleanor was born in 1124. However, some chronicles mention a fidelity oath of lords of Aquitaine on the occasion of Eleanor&#x27;s fourteenth birthday in 1136. Her parents are unlikely to have married before 1121. Her age at her death is thus stated as 80 or 82.

Eleanor (or Aliénor) was the oldest of three children born to William X, Duke of Aquitaine, and Aenor de Châtellerault. Her father was the son of Duke William IX of Aquitaine and Countess Philippa of Toulouse. Her mother was the daughter of Aimery I, Viscount of Châtellerault, and Dangereuse de l&#x27;Isle Bouchard. Dangereuse was also William IX&#x27;s longtime mistress, and she and William IX then arranged for their respective children to be married to each other. Eleanor had two siblings, Aélith (1125–1151) and Aigret (1126–1130).

Eleanor was named for her mother Aenor and baptised as &quot;Aliénor&quot; from the Latin &quot;alia Ænor&quot;, which means &quot;the other Aenor&quot;. It became &quot;Eléanor&quot; in the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; of northern France and &quot;Eleanor&quot; in English, but the exact spelling was never fixed in her lifetime.

Little, if anything, is known of Eleanor&#x27;s education. Eleanor&#x27;s mother died in 1130, when she was only six, and her younger brother also died in that year. The only contemporary record of her education comes from Bertran de Born, the troubadour, who states that she read the poetry of her native tongue.

Although the language of Bordeaux and Poitiers was Poitevin, a northern French (&quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;) dialect, Eleanor was soon exposed to Occitan (&quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;), the southern dialect and language of the poets and courtiers at the ducal court. With the death of her brother, Eleanor became the heir presumptive to her father&#x27;s domains. The Duchy of Aquitaine was the largest and richest province of France, covering an area corresponding to nineteen departments of modern France and about a third of what was then considered France.

==== Inheritance (1137) ====

In 1137, Duke William X left Poitiers for Bordeaux and took his daughters with him. Upon reaching Bordeaux, he left them at l&#x27;Ombrière Castle in the charge of Geoffroi du Louroux, archbishop of Bordeaux, a loyal vassal. William then set out for the Shrine of Saint James of Compostela in the company of other pilgrims. However, he died on Good Friday of that year (9April).

Eleanor, aged 13, then became the duchess of Aquitaine, and thus one of the richest and most eligible heiresses in Europe. Since kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for obtaining a title and lands, when William X knew that he was dying, he placed Eleanor in the care of King Louis VI of France as her guardian, since she would be orphaned. William requested of the King that he take care of both the lands and the duchess, and find her a suitable husband. However, until a husband was found, the King had the legal right to Eleanor&#x27;s lands. William also insisted to his companions that his death be kept a secret until Louis was informed; the men were to journey from Saint James of Compostela across the Pyrenees as quickly as possible to call at Bordeaux to notify the archbishop, then to make all speed to Paris to inform the King.

The King of France, known as Louis the Fat, who was in poor health, recognised an opportunity to realise a long-standing ambition to enlarge his dominions by the acquisition of Aquitaine. His eldest surviving son, Louis, had originally been destined for monastic life, but had become the heir apparent when the King&#x27;s eldest son, Philip, died after being thrown from his horse in 1131.

The death of Duke William, one of the King&#x27;s most powerful vassals, made available the most desirable duchy in France. Louis, who had long sought ways of increasing the relatively small part of France under his direct control, immediately saw the opportunities provided by his guardianship of Eleanor. He realised the dangers of not swiftly settling the succession of the Aquitainian duchy, while a marriage between his son and heir and Eleanor would add the considerable resources of Aquitaine to the Capetian holdings. Thus, he spent little time in dispatching the young Louis, accompanied by a large retinue, some 500 knights, along with Abbot Suger, Geoffrey II, Bishop of Chartres, Theobald II of Champagne and Raoul I of Vermandois to Bordeaux to secure the marriage.

=== Queen of France (1137–1152) ===

==== Marriage ====

Relatively little is known from the time that Eleanor was Queen of France. On 25 July 1137, Eleanor and Louis were married in the Cathedral of Saint-André in Bordeaux by the Archbishop of Bordeaux. Immediately after the wedding, the couple were enthroned as Duke and Duchess of Aquitaine. It was agreed that the duchy would remain independent of France until Eleanor&#x27;s oldest son became both king of France and duke of Aquitaine. Thus, her holdings would not be merged with France until the next generation. As a wedding present she gave Louis a rock crystal vase.

From Bordeaux, the couple proceeded to Poitiers, arriving on 1 August, where after a week of festivities they were invested as Count and Countess of Poitou on 8 August. Louis&#x27;s tenure as Count of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony lasted only a few days. On their way to Paris, a messenger arrived with the news that Louis VI had died on 1 August and therefore they were now King and Queen of France. Louis had already been crowned in the Capetian fashion in 1131 and on Christmas Day 1137, Eleanor was crowned Queen of France at Bourges.

Eleanor was not popular with some members of the court, including Abbot Suger and Louis&#x27;s mother Adelaide of Maurienne, who left the court shortly thereafter and remarried. Some courtiers made unfavourable reference to memories of another southerner, Constance of Arles, from Provence, third wife of Robert II, and ancestor of both Louis VII and Eleanor. Queen Constance had had a reputation for being indiscreet in both dress and language. Eleanor&#x27;s conduct was repeatedly criticised by church elders, particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Suger, as indecorous. Modifications were made to the austere Cité Palace in Paris for Eleanor&#x27;s sake and she was joined by her sister Aélith in Paris, who became known there as Petronilla.

==== Claim to Toulouse 1141 ====

The County of Toulouse had a complicated history of succession. Eleanor was descended from the Counts of Toulouse through her grandmother, Philippa, Countess of Toulouse. Philippa was the sole child of William IV of Toulouse, but following his death in 1093, it was his brother, Philippa&#x27;s uncle Raymond IV () who asserted a right to the title. Philippa then persuaded her husband, William IX of Aquitaine, to enforce her right, a struggle that lasted nearly 30 years, finally ending in 1123 with Raymond IV&#x27;s son, Alfonso Jordan (). During this time, control of Toulouse continually changed hands between William IX and his brother&#x27;s descendants. Philippa&#x27;s claim was passed on to Eleanor&#x27;s father then to Eleanor herself. Louis VII attempted to enforce her claim by marching on Toulouse, arriving at the walls on 21 June 1141. Although he laid siege to the city, he was unable to subjugate it and withdrew, after accepting the homage of Count Alfonso. Despite this setback, Eleanor continued to press her claims, with further expeditions in 1159 and throughout her life.

==== Conflict with the church ====

Louis soon came into conflict with the church and Pope Innocent II (1130–1143). In 1140 he intervened in the election to the see of Poitiers on finding that a new bishop, Grimoald, had been elected and consecrated without his consent. This was despite the fact that his father had granted the ecclesiastical province of Bordeaux the right to do so and that he himself had approved this. Louis then attempted to prohibit Grimoald from entering the city, thus drawing both the Pope and Bernard of Clairvaux into the dispute. The Pope issued an order to overrule the royal edict but Grimoald died, ending the dispute. The ecclesiastical authorities were aware of the unsuccessful attempt of both Eleanor&#x27;s father and grandfather to interfere in church matters. However, the Poitiers affair was soon followed by other attempts by Louis to exert his authority.

The most consequential of these occurred when the Archbishopric of Bourges became vacant in 1141. Louis put forward as a candidate his chancellor, Cadurc, while vetoing the one suitable candidate, Pierre de la Chatre, a monk who was promptly elected by the canons of Bourges and consecrated by the Pope in Rome. Louis accordingly bolted the gates of Bourges against the new archbishop on his return. The Pope, recalling similar attempts by William X to exile supporters of Innocent from Poitou and replace them with priests loyal to himself, may have blamed Eleanor for this, but stated that Louis was only &quot;a foolish schoolboy&quot; and should be taught not to meddle in such matters. Outraged, Louis swore upon relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. An interdict was thereupon imposed upon the royal household and lands, and Pierre was given refuge by Theobald II, Count of Champagne, further annoying the King.

Louis had been in a situation of increasing conflict with Theobald II, and the Bourges affair, together with a crisis in Theobald&#x27;s family, brought this to a head. In 1125 Theobald&#x27;s younger sister Eleanor had married Raoul I, Count of Vermandois and Seneschal of France, but Count Raoul had been forming a liaison with Petronilla, the Queen&#x27;s sister. Raoul eventually deserted his wife, seeking an annulment of their marriage on grounds of consanguinity, to which Louis acquiesced, finding three bishops who agreed that the marriage was invalid and then in 1142 officiated at the wedding of Petronilla and Raoul. Both Theobald, who had taken his sister under protection, and Bernard of Clairvaux protested to the Pope, who convened a council, voided both the annulment from Countess Eleanor and marriage to Petronilla, excommunicated one bishop and suspended the other two. Furthermore, Raoul was ordered to return to his wife. Upon his refusal, he and Petronilla were excommunicated and their lands placed under interdiction.

Eleanor&#x27;s assumed role in these affairs led to the first appearance of the Black legend that would be associated with her for centuries. Women, even queens, were not expected to concern themselves with such matters, and that therefore she might represent darker powers. Rumours began to associate her with mythical figures such as Melusine. Things took a more salacious turn when it was suggested she was having an affair with Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou.

Louis rejected the papal legate&#x27;s decision and ordered an invasion of Champagne, in a war that would last two years (1142–44) and ended with the occupation of Champagne by the royal army. For a year the royal army laid waste to the Champagne countryside, but since Theobald showed no signs of backing down, Louis took personal charge of the assault in 1143, which focused on the siege of the town of Vitry. More than a thousand people sought refuge in the cathedral, which caught fire, burning alive everyone inside. Horrified at the carnage, Louis returned to Paris, seeking to make peace with Theobald. In return, and with the support of the Pope, he demanded Raoul renounce Petronilla and the interdiction on Raoul and Petronilla was duly lifted, while Louis ordered a retreat. When Raoul refused the King&#x27;s demands, the royal forces once more invaded Champagne.

Public opinion was turning against the war and in particular Bernard of Clairvaux was very critical, while Suger advised settling the issues. Innocent II died in September 1143 and was succeeded by Celestine II (1143–1144), who once more lifted the interdiction in an offer of conciliation, at Bernard&#x27;s suggestion and Louis became more open to negotiation. It was about this time that questions of consanguinity were first raised about Louis and Eleanor&#x27;s marriage, since he had opposed a number of other marriages on these grounds, including that of Raoul and Eleanor of Champagne. Consequently, a number of negotiations took place over the winter of 1143–1144. Finally, Suger hosted a meeting at his newly built monastic church at Saint-Denis during a feast day on 22 April 1144, at which Bernard persuaded Eleanor that her efforts on behalf of her sister were hopeless, and peace was restored, although the couple continued to refuse to separate, and they remained excommunicated till 1148 when Raoul&#x27;s first marriage was once again invalidated and his second marriage validated. Also the Saint-Denis agreement included Louis withdrawing his opposition to the archbishop of Bourges. The discussion between Eleanor and Bernard also included reference to her apparent infertility (she had had one miscarriage in 1138), and a suggestion that she might be rewarded for her concessions with a child. In April 1145, Eleanor gave birth to a daughter, Marie. On Sunday, 11 June 1144, the King and Queen attended the dedication of Saint-Denis, at which time Louis donated Eleanor&#x27;s crystal vase.

==== Second Crusade (1145–1149) ====
===== Taking the Cross (1145–1147) =====
Louis remained obsessed over the massacre at Vitry and considered a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but events overtook this desire. The First Crusade (1096–1099) had succeeded in capturing the Holy Land from the Turks and establishing a system of four (largely Frankish) Crusader States to administer the region, known as the Outremer. But this was threatened, when on 24 December 1144, Zengi and the Saracen Turks captured Edessa, capital of one of the Frankish States, making the adjacent States of Antioch, Tripoli and Jerusalem vulnerable. Of these, Antioch was the most vulnerable, and of particular concern since the Prince of Antioch was Raymond of Poitiers, Eleanor&#x27;s uncle. In the autumn of 1145, Louis had received emissaries from the Outremer, and appeals were also sent to Pope Eugene III (1145–1153). On 1 December the Pope issued a bull requesting that Louis and all faithful Christians of France mount a crusade to rescue the remaining States. In exchange they would receive a remission of their sins. Louis and Eleanor were at Bourges when the message arrived and Louis responded enthusiastically on Christmas Day, that he would lead a crusade. Noting a lack of enthusiasm among the French nobility, Louis postponed further action till Easter 1146, having recruited Bernard of Clairveaux to deliver a message supporting his crusade at Vézelay on 31 March.

Queen Eleanor also formally took the cross during Bernard&#x27;s sermon, which meant leaving her daughter behind. Eleanor recruited some women of the Aquitainian nobility for the campaign as well as some 300 other women who volunteered to help. It was not unusual for women to take part in crusades. From Louis&#x27;s perspective, there were advantages in including her. As regent to an absent monarch, she could have created problems for Suger, Louis&#x27;s choice as his administrator, and he needed the support of the Aquitainian nobility. Furthermore, the crusade was ostensibly to come to the aid of her uncle. The presence of women was not without its critics, particularly among clerics, though this may have been influenced by hindsight, given that William of Newburgh&#x27;s account was written well after the actual crusade.

In February 1147, the planning process of the crusade was initiated at Étampes, where it was learned that Conrad III of Germany would be joining their venture, and requests for safe passages through adjacent lands were sent. Final planning took place at Saint-Denis over Easter that year, on 20 April, at which Pope Eugene attended. Louis delegated administration of his kingdom to Eugene, who appointed Suger regent, with Ralph of Vermandois as co-regent. Eleanor&#x27;s taking the cross provided the next opportunity for her detractors to construct her legend, with claims that she and her ladies set off for the crusades as Amazonian warriors.

===== Road to Ephesus (1147) =====

On 11 June some 25,000 to 50,000 crusaders and Pilgrims gathered at Saint-Denis and began their march, first to Metz and then crossing the Rhine at Worms, and pressing on to Regensburg and the Danube river. There they were met by envoys from Manuel Komnenos (), the Byzantine Emperor, and followed the river via Klosterneuburg and through Hungary, reaching Belgrade and the Eastern Empire by mid-August and then, crossing the Danube, to Adrianople and finally Constantinople, five days later, on 4 October 1147.

In Constantinople, the French crusaders were obliged to pause and await the arrival of those of their forces that were travelling by sea. While there they received the hospitality of the Emperor, Louis and Eleanor staying in the Philopation palace just outside the city walls. Meanwhile, the German crusaders had gone ahead and crossed the Bosphorus into Asia Minor. Once all their forces were gathered together, the French crossed into Asia on 15 October and proceeded south to their first stop at Nicaea. Continuing south down the Aegean coast, they discovered that the Germans, who had proceeded directly inland, had suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Turks, at the battle of Dorylaeum, and that the Emperor had been wounded. The French, together with the remnants of the Germans continued south on the safer coastal route to Ephesus, via Pergamus and Smyrna, which they reached on 20 December. After camping at Ephesus, Conrad and most of the Germans left them, returning to Constantinople by sea.

===== Ephesus to Jerusalem (1148–1149) =====

In January 1148, Louis decided to travel inland towards Laodicea in Phrygia, in order to reach Antalya on the south coast and thus Antioch more quickly. They reached Laodicea on 6 January and then their route took them across the mountains. On the day of their crossing of Mount Cadmus, Louis took charge of the rear of the column, where the unarmed pilgrims and the baggage trains were, while the vanguard was commanded by the Aquitainian, Geoffrey de Rancon, and instructed to set camp on the plateau before the next pass. They reached the summit of Cadmus, one of the highest in their path, but Rancon, in concert with Louis&#x27;s uncle Amadeus III, Count of Savoy and Maurienne, chose to continue on through the pass to the next valley, judging it a better campsite.

Accordingly, when the main part of the column arrived, and approached the pass, separated from both the vanguard and rearguard, they were attacked by the Turkish forces, lying in wait. In the ensuing Battle of Mount Cadmus, the Turks inflicted great losses on the French, while Louis himself, barely escaped. Odo of Deuil describes how he &quot;nimbly and bravely scaled a rock by making use of some tree roots which God had provided for his safety&quot; Others were not so fortunate: &quot;No aid came from Heaven, except that night fell.&quot;

The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.

Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. Official blame for the disaster was placed on Geoffrey de Rancon, who had made the decision to continue, and it was suggested that he be hanged, a suggestion which the King ignored. Since Geoffrey was Eleanor&#x27;s vassal, many believed that it was she who had been ultimately responsible for the change in plan, and thus the massacre. This suspicion of responsibility did nothing for her popularity in Christendom. She was also blamed for the size of the baggage train and the fact that her Aquitanian soldiers had marched at the front and thus were not involved in the fight. Eventually, the survivors reached Antalya on 20 January.


In Antalya, the crusaders found there was a limited number of ships available, and those that were required more money than they were willing to pay. Consequently, the royal party sailed from the port with a relatively small group of followers, arriving in Antioch on 19 March, well behind schedule. The remainder attempted to complete the journey with great hardship and much loss, only about half of them completing the journey.

While the crusaders were initially welcomed, tensions grew between them and Raymond. Raymond&#x27;s agenda was to attack Aleppo and regain control of Edessa, and hence gain some security, while Louis was determined to press on to Jerusalem, despite the original papal decree being to recapture Edessa. Louis was not keen to fight in northern Syria, and his forces were badly depleted. Furthermore, he had a personal agenda to journey in pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

Eleanor&#x27;s loyalty to her uncle created conflict between Louis and Eleanor. Eventually the French, now only a tenth of their original strength, left Antioch abruptly on 28 March, despite Eleanor&#x27;s protests and attempts to remain with Raymond. These conflicts once again led to the question of consanguinity being raised. According to John of Salisbury, it was Eleanor who prompted this. The crusaders reached Jerusalem in May, entering by the Jaffa Gate, where they were greeted by Queen Melisende and King Baldwin III. A conference was then held at Acre on 24 June, to discuss strategic plans. This resulted in the disastrous siege of Damascus on 24 July. The crusaders&#x27; forced withdrawal after only four days effectively ended the crusade and many of the survivors started making plans to return, but Louis vowed to celebrate Easter 1149 in the Holy Land, despite the pleas of Suger.

The sojourn in Antioch and the conflict between the rulers and the resulting rift between the royal couple led to chroniclers, such as John of Salisbury and William of Tyre, hinting at an adulterous and incestuous affair between Eleanor and Raymond, that would become an enduring part of her legend, which in some versions also depicted her as having an affair with a Saracen leader. Contemporary accounts suggest it was her attention to political affairs that was considered the greatest stain on her character.

===== Return to France (1149) =====

After celebrating Easter, Louis and Eleanor set sail from Acre for Italy in separate ships on 3 April but were delayed by both hostile naval forces off the Peloponnesus in May and storms which drove Eleanor&#x27;s ship as far south as the Barbary Coast, and for a while their whereabouts were unknown. Louis arrived in Calabria on 29 July and eventually discovered Eleanor had reached Palermo, Sicily, where she was sheltered by agents of King Roger II at his palace. It took some time before Eleanor and Louis could be reunited.

At King Roger&#x27;s court in Potenza, Eleanor had learned of the death of her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Nureddin&#x27;s (Nur ad-Din) Muslim forces at the Battle of Inab, on 29 June. Nureddin then overran most of Raymond&#x27;s territories in Antioch, setting back the goals of the crusade even further. Instead of returning directly to France, Louis and Eleanor headed north towards Rome and the Pope, stopping at the Abbey of Monte Cassino on 4 October after Eleanor fell ill. Pope Eugenius invited them to stay at his palace at Tusculum, south of Rome, where they arrived on 9 October. Eugenius had been informed by Suger of the couple&#x27;s marital problems, and that they were no longer having sexual relations. The question of consanguinity, and hence possible annulment was again raised, but was denied by Eugenius, who declared the marriage legitimate by canon law and urged reconciliation. It is likely that Eleanor&#x27;s second child was conceived at this time. From Tusculum, the couple travelled north through Italy, visiting Rome and then crossing the Alps to reach France and finally arriving in Paris around 11 November 1149, after an absence of two and a half years.

==== Annulment (1152) ====

In the summer of 1150, Eleanor gave birth to a second daughter, Alix (Adelicia). The lack of a male heir was unprecedented in the Capetian line, Eleanor was now twenty-six and had been married for thirteen years. Not only was the likelihood of a son being born to secure the succession seen as remote, but the lack of an heir was perceived as an omen. Suger had been a strong advocate for the political advantages of the marriage between Louis and Eleanor. When he died on 13 January 1151, the balance changed since Bernard of Clairvaux was a critic of the marriage&#x27;s consanguinity. A number of nobles and courtiers also advised the King to dissolve the marriage. Later that year, Henry, Count of Anjou, appeared at the court in Paris to pay homage as the new Duke of Normandy to King Louis. Chroniclers such as Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales), William of Newburgh and Walter Map later implied that something happened between Henry and Eleanor, eleven years his senior, that contributed to the dissolution of her marriage with Louis.

By this stage, her reputation badly damaged, Eleanor&#x27;s influence at court was waning. Any such dissolution would require a complex political realignment, separating the Aquitanian and Capetian possessions and jurisdictions, and in the autumn of 1151 the couple made a tour of the duchy during which much of the French presence, such as garrisons, was replaced with Eleanor&#x27;s people. On 11 March 1152, at the royal castle of Beaugency on the Loire, near Orléans, Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens and Primate of France, presided over a synod to consider the matter. Louis and Eleanor were both present, as were the archbishops of Reims, Bordeaux and Rouen and many other bishops and nobility. Archbishop Samson of Reims acted for Eleanor, who did not contest the action.

On 21 March, the four archbishops, with the approval of Pope Eugenius, granted an annulment on grounds of consanguinity within the fourth degree; Eleanor was Louis&#x27;s third cousin once removed, and shared common ancestry with Robert II of France and his wife Constance of Arles. Their two daughters were, however, declared legitimate. Children born to a marriage that was later annulled were not at risk of being &quot;bastardised,&quot; because &quot;[w]here the parties married in good faith, without knowledge of an impediment, the canonists held that the children of the marriage were legitimate and that the marriage itself was valid up to the day it was declared null&quot;. Custody of their daughters was awarded to King Louis, as both custom and law decreed. Louis assured Archbishop Samson that Eleanor&#x27;s lands would be restored to her.

While Eleanor stated that the reason for the annulment was &quot;for reasons of kinship with my Lord, Louis&quot;, the event fueled speculation as to her behaviour and added to the growing legend. Equally without evidence are accounts of a distraught discarded wife.

=== Queen of England (1154–1189) ===

==== Marriage, wars and family (1152–1154) ====

Once again a single woman with possessions, Eleanor was at risk of abduction and forced marriage to acquire her domains. This &quot;rapuit et abduxit&quot; was a common practice regarding heiresses, even in her own family. From Beaugency, she travelled south towards her court in Poitiers. On her route she narrowly evaded two attempts to kidnap her. The first was by Theobald V, Count of Blois and Chartres, on the night of 21 March as she passed through his lands at Blois, but she escaped by taking a boat down the Loire to Tours. Then Geoffrey of Anjou lay in wait for her at Port-de-Piles, on the border of Touraine and Poitou, but warned at Tours of the plot, she changed her route, avoiding the usual crossing of the Creuse river, she continued downstream to its confluence with the Vienne river, avoiding main roads, and arriving safely by boat at Poitiers.

As soon as she arrived in Poitiers, just before Easter, Eleanor sent envoys to Geoffrey of Anjou&#x27;s older brother, Henry, Duke of Normandy, asking him to come at once to marry her. Many authors conclude that this fulfilled a prior arrangement made at his earlier visit to the French court. While providing security for her Aquitaine lands, the choice of Henry also made political sense as Anjou lay on the northern border of Aquitaine, thus protecting it and enlarging her joint jurisdiction. She then set about revoking all acts and charters of Louis relating to Aquitaine, and replacing them with her own. The message reached Henry at Lisieux on 6 April. Henry arrived in Poitiers in mid May and on 18 May 1152 (Whit Sunday), eight weeks after her annulment, Eleanor married the much younger Henry in a quiet private ceremony at Poitiers Cathedral, thereby transferring her Aquitaine lands from Louis to Henry. The ceremony was described as being &quot;without the pomp and ceremony that befitted their rank&quot;. They had kept the arrangements secret, for fear that Louis, who regarded the growing power of Henry and the Angevins with anxiety, would prevent it.

Eleanor was related to Henry even more closely than she had been to Louis: they were cousins to the third degree through their common ancestor Ermengarde of Anjou (wife of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy and Geoffrey, Count of Gâtinais), and they were also descended from King Robert II of France. Her remarriage to Henry provided the next chapter of the legend of her scandalous behaviour, it being implied that she had a previous illicit relationship with him.

When Louis discovered Eleanor had married his archrival, and knowing Henry was also in line for succession to the throne of England, he was furious and immediately made preparations for war. He also refused to give up the title of Duke of Aquitaine, that he had acquired through marriage to Eleanor, and was now Henry&#x27;s by the same right, for if Eleanor bore a male heir, his daughters would be disinherited. His subsequent invasion of Normandy marked the beginning of an Angevin-Capetian conflict that would last more than fifty years.

Now, as Duchess of both Aquitaine and Normandy, Eleanor exercised independent power in her court and within her hereditary domains, striking new seals for her charters, both as Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitou, but also with the added titles of Duchess of the Normans and Countess of the Angevins. Within a month, Henry departed with the intention of pursuing his claim to the throne of England but now had to deal with Louis&#x27;s invasion of Normandy, which he easily repelled within six weeks, signing a truce, so that by the autumn of that year he was able to return to Aquitaine. To commemorate their marriage, Henry and Eleanor had a stained glass window installed at Poitiers Cathedral, in which they are represented, kneeling as donors. By late 1152, the couple moved to Rouen in Normandy and in January 1153 Henry finally set sail for England to challenge King Stephen&#x27;s claim to the throne. He did not return till March 1154, leaving the now pregnant Eleanor with his mother, the Empress Matilda, and his youngest brother, William. On 17 August 1153, Henry and Eleanor&#x27;s first child, William, was born, most likely at Angers.

In England, Henry had finally fought Stephen to a truce, and at the Treaty of Winchester in November 1153, it was agreed that Henry would be Stephen&#x27;s heir and successor, and this was ratified at Westminster at Christmas. Upon Henry&#x27;s return to his French domains, Eleanor again became pregnant. Meanwhile, Louis VII remarried, became reconciled with Henry and relinquished the title of Duke of Aquitaine.

==== Queen and regent (1154–1173) ====

===== Early years in England (1154–1158) =====

On 25 October 1154, King Stephen died. Although Henry was immediately summoned to England, it was not until 7 December that he and Eleanor were able to cross the channel from Barfleur, landing near Southampton on the 8th. They travelled first to Winchester to greet Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, who had been acting as regent. From Winchester, the royal party moved to London and were lodged at the royal palace at Bermondsey. On 19 December 1154, Archbishop Theobald crowned Henry as King Henry II in Westminster Abbey, with Eleanor beside him. It is unclear whether Eleanor was actually crowned or anointed as well, since she had already been crowned queen of France in 1137. This was the beginning of the House of Plantagenet that would rule England till the end of the fifteenth century.

As queen of England, Eleanor was provided for generously by Henry, including multiple dowerlands and regular settlements of money that made her one of the richest people in the kingdom, earning her the title of &quot;riche dame de riche rei&quot;. Relatively little is known about Eleanor during the reign of Henry II, in that the chroniclers barely mention her, other than to note when she was with the King, and biographies have been built on these itineraries and surviving official documents, including letters, writs and charters. She signed her official documents . This was not uncommon, in that the activities of women were not thought to be of sufficient importance to report, they were merely . Furthermore, the independence and authority of queens had been progressively eroded prior to her ascension to the role. She would, however participate with the King in ceremonial occasions such as the Easter or Christmas courts, though she never learned English.

Henry&#x27;s dominions stretched from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees, and he was frequently travelling through them, both in England and France and was absent from England far more than any of his predecessors. For much of his absences from court Eleanor acted as either regent or co-regent with the justiciar. Although she sometimes accompanied King Henry, she also travelled extensively throughout her domains on her own or with her children. While claims that she was an influential patron of the arts appear to be greatly exaggerated, many writers dedicated works to her, for a variety of reasons, chiefly their own advancement. These include Robert Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; () and William of Blois, while other writers such as Marie de France and the author of &quot;Roman de Thebes&quot; are believed to have been inspired by her. Some writers, such as Marie de France appear to associate her with the Arthurian Legends, while the more speculative Eleanor legends even associate her with the person of Guinevere.

On 28 February 1155, Eleanor gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second child, Henry, during the King&#x27;s absence. On 10 January 1156, King Henry left England for one of his many prolonged absences, leaving Eleanor pregnant again. It was during this absence, in the spring of 1156, that Prince William died and was buried at Reading Abbey, next to his great-grandfather Henry I. Shortly after, in June of that year, the couple&#x27;s third child Matilda was born and Eleanor and her children travelled to France to be with Henry in July, returning in February 1157. Henry joined her in England in April, and on 8 September their fourth child, Richard, was born at Beaumont Palace. After 1156, Eleanor&#x27;s autonomous rule of her duchy was much diminished, her name disappearing other than to confirm acts of Henry, for whom Aquitainians had little respect.

===== Toulouse Campaign (1159) =====

Meanwhile, Louis VII had remarried in 1154, and by 1157 had a third daughter, Marguerite. Noting a seeming inability of Louis to produce a male heir, Henry II conceived of a plan to eventually acquire the French throne by marrying his son Henry to Marguerite and began making plans in 1158, and travelling to France in August to negotiate the terms with Louis, and take the infant Marguerite into his care until she was old enough to marry. He would remain away for over four years. While Henry was away, Eleanor gave birth to a fourth son, Geoffrey on 23 September 1158, and shortly after rejoined Henry in France. In 1159, Henry, accompanied by Eleanor, made a further unsuccessful attempt at enforcing her claims to Toulouse through her grandmother, thereby alienating Louis VII again, since Raymond V, Count of Toulouse was both his vassal and now his relative. Although Henry had formed a coalition to conquer Toulouse, Louis came to Raymond&#x27;s aid. Amongst Henry&#x27;s allies was Raymond-Berengar IV, Prince of Aragon and Count of Barcelona. He symbolically tied the two dynasties by betrothing his son Richard to Raymond-Berengar&#x27;s daughter. But by September Henry had been forced to a temporary truce, although this was the beginning of forty years of war between England and France. Eleanor sailed to England on 29 December, obtained funds for Henry&#x27;s campaigns and escorted it to him in France before returning to England.

===== Later years in England (1159–1168) =====

It was not till September 1160 that Henry again summoned Eleanor and the children to be with him in France. Louis VII&#x27;s second wife had died that year, providing him with only two daughters but no male heir, and he promptly arranged a third marriage. Therefore, Henry II decided to immediately arrange for Prince Henry&#x27;s marriage to Marguerite, despite their being only children. For this he obtained a special dispensation from the church, and the marriage proceeded on 2 November, unbeknown to Louis. Eleanor remained in France and in September 1161 gave birth to their second daughter, Eleanor, at Domfront, Normandy. The number of years between the birth of Geoffrey (1158) and Eleanor (1161) compared to Queen Eleanor&#x27;s other pregnancies has given rise to speculation about the presence of another child. John Speed, in his &quot;History of Great Britain&quot; (1611), states that Eleanor had a son named Philip, born sometime between 1158 and 1162 and died young. His sources no longer exist, and he alone mentions this birth. Henry and Eleanor finally returned to England on 25 January 1163, after their prolonged absence, which also marked the end of her duties as regent in England.

February 1165 saw Henry back on the continent to arrange the marriages of their daughters, Matilda and Eleanor, to cement an alliance with Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Eleanor joined him on 1 May, acting as his regent in Anjou and Maine. It was there that another daughter, Joan, was born at Angers in October, although Henry was not there, having returned to England only two weeks after her arrival. During much of these times the royal couple saw very little of each other, Henry not joining her till she asked for his help in dealing with a potential revolt in March 1166. His conflict with the Breton nobles being settled by betrothing Prince Geoffrey to Constance, daughter of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany.

These long periods of separation would give rise to speculation and then rumours of Henry&#x27;s infidelities, and a resultant rift between him and Eleanor. The most notorious of these stories was that of an alleged affair, starting some time in 1165, with Rosamund Clifford. By late 1166, Henry&#x27;s affair had become known, and was acknowledged by 1174. Henry was by no means faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering; he fathered other, illegitimate, children throughout the marriage. Eleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. Geoffrey of York, for example, was an illegitimate son of Henry, but acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at Westminster in the care of the Queen.

Following the birth of Joanna, Eleanor remained at Angers. Henry did not join her for Christmas that year, only crossing to France in March 1166, where he would remain for another four years. The unprecedented separation at Christmas also led to speculation of discord, but Henry was with her by Easter that year, when she conceived their last child, John. After Easter, Eleanor returned to England, and Christmas 1166 was again spent apart, with John having been born on Christmas Eve. Eleanor, now 42 years old, did not join Henry in France till they spent Christmas 1167 together at Angers. This year also saw her bringing Matilda, then only eleven, to the continent in September in preparation for her marriage to the much older Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, which took place on 1 February 1168.

Henry II&#x27;s reign was marred by a bitter feud with Thomas Becket, which began in 1163. Becket was initially a close friend and adviser, then his chancellor and eventually Archbishop of Canterbury. There has been some speculation as to what role Eleanor may have played in this, but very little evidence. During his exile in France from 1164, Becket unsuccessfully sought her help. What little evidence exists though, suggests that she urged reconciliation.

In December 1167, Eleanor gathered her movable possessions in England and transported them on several ships to Argentan. Christmas was celebrated at the royal court there, and immediately afterward she left for her own city of Poitiers. Henry and his army went with her before attacking a castle belonging to the rebellious Lusignan family, who threatened to switch allegiance to Louis. Henry then went about his own business outside Aquitaine, leaving Patrick, Earl of Salisbury, his regional military commander, as her protective custodian. When Patrick was killed in a skirmish with the Lusignans, Eleanor, who proceeded to ransom his captured nephew, the young William Marshal, was left in control of her lands. There she would remain until 1173, a move that facilitated Henry&#x27;s control over a corner of his realm where the vassals were continually rebelling. This move also led to speculation of a marital breakdown. By 1168, Eleanor was 44 years old and had born eight children, including three future kings, and her childbearing years were now over.

By this time, Louis VII had finally been given a son, by his third wife. The birth of Philip Augustus, also known as Dieudonné—God-given, in 1165 ended Henry II&#x27;s attempts to add the throne of France to the Angevin empire through dynastic alliances.

===== Poitier years (1168–1173) =====

The separation of Eleanor and Henry during the next five years has been the subject of much speculation as to whether it was predominantly a matter of political expediency, an indication of a growing rift between the couple or both. Certainly Eleanor had fulfilled her queenly duties of providing both male heirs and daughters as commodities for alliances, but was now too old to provide further children. Also, she successfully set about restoring order in proverbially restless Aquitaine, and continued in her royal duties as Angevin queen, including acting as regent in various French territories. Richard of Devizes suggested it was Eleanor that initiated the separation and that Henry did not oppose it.

Although not much is known about Eleanor&#x27;s whereabouts during this period, Christmas 1168 was spent apart, Henry at Argentan and Eleanor at Poitiers. On 6 January 1169, Henry and his two eldest sons, met with Louis VII at Montmirail, Maine. The resulting Treaty of Montmirail was to have long term consequences for all the members of Henry&#x27;s family. In the treaty, Henry divided his domains between his sons and betrothed Prince Richard to Louis&#x27; daughter Alys. In addition to keeping his vassals in order and maintaining relations with the French king, Henry was busy creating domestic alliances. Geoffrey was betrothed to Constance of Brittany and negotiations were begun to marry Joanna to King William II of Sicily and John to Alicia, eldest daughter of Humbert III, Count of Savoy. To further secure a peaceful succession he sought to continue the Capetian tradition of crowning his heir, Prince Henry. Despite opposition from the Church, this took place on 14 June 1170, and from then on he was referred to as Henry the Young King. While Henry appeared to be in communication during this period, it is not evident that they actually saw much of each other, other than at some of the major feasts, such as Christmas at Bur-le-Roi, near Bayeux, in 1170 and at Chinon in 1172. While there were rumours of alienation between the couple, Eleanor did begin to exert increasing autonomy in ruling her duchy. For instance she changed her formal address to omit &quot;the king&#x27;s&quot;, merely stating &quot;to her faithful followers&quot;.

During this period, relations between Henry II and his young sons became increasingly fractious. Having been allocated portions of the Angevin empire at Montmirail, they were eager to assume their powers, rather than wait for their father&#x27;s death, as had been arranged. Louis VII was aware of this and now that the Young King was his son-in-law, saw an opportunity to exploit these divisions. In November 1172, Louis invited his daughter, Queen Marguerite, and the seventeen-year-old King Henry to Paris where he encouraged the former&#x27;s ambitions.

====== Courtly love, troubadours and the Golden Myth ======

Of all her influence on culture, Eleanor&#x27;s time in Poitiers between 1168 and 1173 has been claimed to be the most critical, yet very little is actually known about it. Henry II was occupied with his own affairs after escorting Eleanor there. For a long time, writers dealing with this period stated that her court was a center of chivalry and the troubadour culture. This evolved further into the tradition, that in conjunction with her daughter by Louis VII, Marie of Champagne, she presided over what became known as &quot;The Court of Love&quot;, where courtly love thrived. While troubadours both attended her court and praised her, the Court of Love was a later literary invention. This emerged from a late 12th century treatise known as &quot;The Art of Courtly Love&quot;, or &quot;Tractatus de amore et de amoris remedio&quot; by Andreas Capellanus (Andrew the Chaplain). Capellanus has been traditionally described as chaplain to Marie of Champagne in Troyes, and the work appeared long after the period of Eleanor&#x27;s court in Poitiers, and is largely satirical.

The &quot;Tractatus&quot; stated that Eleanor, together with Marie, Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne, Isabelle of Flanders and other ladies would sit and listen to the quarrels of lovers and act as a jury to the questions of the court that revolved around acts of romantic love. He records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true love can exist in marriage. According to Capellanus, the women decided that it was not at all likely. There is no evidence for any of Capellanus&#x27; claims, Marie never visited her mother and the court at which Capellanus wrote was hostile to Henry II and Eleanor. Despite this, many popular accounts, such as the biography by Polly Schoyer Brooks, continue to give credence to it, at least as some sort of &quot;parlor game&quot;.

There is no evidence to the claim that Eleanor invented &quot;courtly love&quot;, an expression that only appeared in the late nineteenth century. The concept of &quot;courtoisie&quot; (&quot;amour courtois&quot;, &quot;fin&#x27;amor&quot;) was a set of attitudes regarding love associated with the courts and praised by troubadours that had begun to grow before Eleanor&#x27;s Poitier period. Her paternal grandfather, William IX (1071–1126) was considered a troubadour who extolled the growing popularity of tales of love and chivalry, long before this. What can be said, is that this &quot;fin&#x27;amor&quot; first appeared in the south in the early twelfth century, became popular and spread north, and that there were troubadours at Eleanor&#x27;s court, such as Bernart de Ventadorn and Arnaut Guilhem de Marsan, as at other Occitan courts. The rest is merely conjecture. The legend of a court of love has formed an important element in what has been referred to as the &quot;Golden Myth&quot; of Eleanor&#x27;s life.

==== Revolt and imprisonment (1173–1189) ====
===== Revolt and arrest (1173–1174) =====

From 21 to 28 February 1173, Henry and Eleanor were together at Montferrand for the betrothal of Prince John to Alice of Maurienne. The occasion was marred by open conflict between the two Henrys over the delegation of powers. From Montferrat, the royal entourage moved to Limoges, where matters worsened. Henry and his son then headed north together in March to Chinon, where they arrived on the 5th. In the morning, Henry II discovered his son had escaped his custody and travelled to Paris and Louis VII. The latter then informed King Henry II that he was now supporting his son as the new reigning monarch. This was the beginning of the Revolt of 1173–1174.

Later chroniclers assigned much of the blame to Eleanor, adding to her deepening reputation and leading to much speculation regarding motive, despite lack of evidence, although they carefully added &quot;so it was said&quot; to their accounts. Other evidence implicates the Young King&#x27;s father-in-law, Louis VII. From Paris, William of Newburgh recounts, &quot;the younger Henry, devising evil against his father from every side by the advice of the French king, went secretly into Aquitaine where his two youthful brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, were living with their mother, and with her connivance, so it is said, he incited them to join him.&quot; Roger of Hoveden gives a somewhat different account, stating that Eleanor sent the younger sons to France and their older brother &quot;to join with him against their father the King.&quot; Young Henry and his brothers then returned to Paris in the spring and Eleanor encouraged her vassals to support her sons.

Later, in April, Eleanor too would set out to travel to Paris to join her sons. But she was seized on the road to Chartres and taken to Henry II in Rouen. The King did not announce the arrest publicly but had her confined, and for the next year the Queen&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown. Meanwhile, Louis held court in Paris, where the French nobles swore allegiance to the Young King. Of Henry II&#x27;s sons, only seven-year-old John remained with his father. Hostilities commenced in May, with the forces of Young Henry and Louis VII&#x27;s invading Normandy, although neither side prevailed during 1173. After a brief winter truce, Henry II entered Poitiers in May 1174, and took his daughter Joanna together with other noble ladies back to his stronghold in Normandy. On either 7 or 8 July 1174, Henry II, facing imminent invasion of England, took ship and sailed with Eleanor, John, Joanna and the other ladies from Barfleur to Southampton, from where Eleanor was taken to an unknown place of confinement.

===== Imprisonment (1173–1189) =====

While Henry II was ultimately victorious and made some concessions to his sons at the Treaty of Montlouis on 30 September 1174, Eleanor was confined to various degrees for the rest of Henry&#x27;s life in various locations in England, about which there is very little information, although pipe rolls refer to Ludgershall Castle in Wiltshire, to Buckinghamshire and various houses in Berkshire and Nottinghamshire. Gerald of Wales states that Henry considered having his marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity during 1175, requesting a visit from a papal legate to discuss the matter further, and meeting with Cardinal Pierlone at Winchester on 1 November, who dissuaded him from this course. In early 1176, he tried again, by persuading Eleanor to become a nun at Fontevrault. She then requested the Archbishop of Rouen to intervene and he supported her refusal, prompting Henry to once again attempt to seek papal approval, which was denied.

Meanwhile, Henry continued his use of his children to forge alliances. In the summer of 1176, Eleanor was at Winchester with Joanna, then eleven. As soon as plans for her marriage to William II of Sicily were concluded, she was sent there on 27 August, the marriage taking place on 13 February 1177. On 28 September 1176, John was betrothed to Isabella of Gloucester (also known as Hawise), who was his cousin and was three years old. In September 1177, Princess Eleanor left for Castille and was married to Alfonso VIII in Burgos, while Geoffrey was married to Constance of Brittany in July 1181.

While Eleanor remained confined, she was not strictly a prisoner, but rather in a form of &quot;house arrest&quot; although stripped of her revenues, and in the later part of this period enjoyed some greater freedoms from 1177 onwards and particularly after 1184, and would witness the death of two more of her sons (Henry and Geoffrey) and her daughter Matilda, but very little information exists about these years.

During her imprisonment, Eleanor became more and more distant from her sons, since Henry II could not afford having her in communication with them, and possibly plotting against him. This was especially so for Richard, her heir in Aquitaine, who had always been her favourite. She did not have the opportunity to see her sons very often during her imprisonment, though she was released for special occasions such as Easter 1176.

Rosamund Clifford died in 1176 or 1177 at Godstow, Oxfordshire. Henry erected a tomb in the abbey and gave gifts to the abbey in her memory. Her death would much later lead to myths concerning Eleanor&#x27;s putative involvement that grew more elaborate over the centuries, and for a long time were accepted as established facts, further building her Black Legend, despite virtually no contemporary evidence to support this.

Some chroniclers, including Gerald of Wales, Ralph Niger, Roger of Hoveden and Ranulf Higden state that Henry then began an affair with the sixteen-year-old Alys of France, a matter complicated by the fact that she was betrothed to his son Richard and was also the daughter of Louis VII, who became alarmed on hearing this news. In the meantime, Henry delayed the marriage, which Richard was now resisting and Alys bore Henry several children.

The years of Eleanor&#x27;s confinement were marked by almost constant warfare, between their sons and rebellious vassals – especially Aquitaine, between each other and with their father. The situation became further complicated by the death of the ailing Louis VII on 18 September 1180, and the succession of his son Philip II. Philip, who was the brother-in-law of Henry the Young the heir apparent, was even more determined than his father to regain the French lands of Henry and his sons, and to exploit the conflicts in that dysfunctional family.

During one of these campaigns, Eleanor&#x27;s son Henry died of dysentery on 11 June 1183, at Martel, Quercy, at the age of twenty-eight. His dying wishes included a plea for his mother to be set free and that his wife Marguerite be provided for. Henry II sent Thomas Agnell (Thomas of Early), Archdeacon of Wells, to Eleanor at Sarum to inform her of her son&#x27;s death. He later described how she told him she had a premonition in a dream. Many years later, in 1193, she related to Pope Celestine III how much she was tortured by her memories of the Young King. Henry&#x27;s death, as heir apparent, changed the family dynamics, leaving Richard as the new heir.

As a result of the Young King&#x27;s death and his wish for Marguerite&#x27;s lands to be protected, Henry II found himself in conflict with Philip II, Marguerite&#x27;s half-brother. Philip claimed that certain properties in Normandy and England belonged to Marguerite, but Henry insisted that they had once belonged to Eleanor and would revert to her upon her son&#x27;s death. It was therefore politically expedient that Eleanor be seen in the disputed territories and Henry summoned her to Normandy in the late summer of 1183. This marked the beginning of a loosening of the restrictions on her. Roger of Hovenden states that the King commanded she &quot;be freed and that she make a progress about her dowerlands&quot;. Her income also improved. Geoffroy du Brueil states that she remained in Normandy for about six months.

Young Henry&#x27;s death necessitated a renegotiation of the treaty of Montmirail and the contentious question of Richard&#x27;s betrothal to Alys, resulting in a further meeting of the English and French kings at Gisors, Normandy on 6 December 1183, at which time Henry revoked much of the land concessions he had made earlier. Eleanor returned to England in early 1184, where her daughter Matilda and son-in-law Henry (now in exile) were able to stay with her at Winchester and then Berkhamsted. At Winchester, Matilda gave birth to her fifth child, William. On 30 November at Westminster, Eleanor and Henry presided over another unsuccessful attempt to bring peace with their warring sons and settle their inheritance, and the family spent Christmas at Windsor. In early 1185, they journeyed to Normandy, where a further family council took place in May. She would remain in Normandy for nearly a year, the royal couple returning to Southampton from Barfleur England on 27 April 1186, spending the summer together at Winchester, though there is very little information on her whereabouts from then till 1189. However, even in Aquitaine affairs, it was clear she had little freedom to act, stating that her acts were &quot;with the assent and at the will of her lord Henry, King of England, and of Richard, Geoffrey and John, her sons&quot; The family situation changed further when Geoffrey died in Paris on 18 or 19 August 1186, leaving only Richard and John as heirs but conflict between them and with their father continued over their inheritance, and Richard made yet another attempt at adding Toulouse to the Aquitaine domain, bringing Henry and Philip into direct conflict once more, which would lead to twenty-seven years of intermittent war. This time Richard and Philip combined their forces against an ailing Henry, forcing him to relinquish much of his French possessions. After John joined this alliance against his father, Henry&#x27;s health deteriorated further and he died at Chinon on 6 July 1189, aged fifty-six. At around this time, Eleanor also received news of Matilda&#x27;s death.

Over the last few years Eleanor had often travelled with her husband and was sometimes associated with him in the government of the realm, but still had a custodian so that she was never fully free. Henry&#x27;s death ended a marriage which has been described as tumultuous and Eleanor&#x27;s long years of imprisonment.

=== Widow and queen mother (1189–1204) ===

==== Richard I (1189–1199) ====
===== Release from prison and regency (1189) =====

Upon the death of Henry II on 6 July 1189, Richard I was the undisputed heir. One of his first acts as king was to send William Marshal to England with orders to release the sixty-five-year-old Eleanor from prison; he found upon his arrival that her custodians had already released her, whereupon she assumed the powers of regent, bestowed upon her by Richard who was still in France. Eleanor then rode to Westminster and received the oaths of fealty from the lords and prelates on behalf of the new king. She ruled England in Richard&#x27;s name, now signing herself &quot;Eleanor, by the grace of God, Queen of England&quot;, and reversed many of Henry II&#x27;s acts.

===== Third Crusade and journey to Italy (1189–1191) =====

On 13 August 1189, Richard sailed from Barfleur to Portsmouth and was received with enthusiasm, proceeding from there to Winchester to meet Eleanor. At this time, Eleanor&#x27;s two surviving sons were unmarried, raising questions about succession. However, on 29 August, Prince John carried out his father&#x27;s wishes, marrying his cousin Isabella, to whom he had been betrothed in 1176. On 3 September Richard was crowned at Westminster Abbey, with Eleanor and John in attendance. Following the coronation, Richard was preoccupied with a long planned participation in the Third Crusade, and on his first absence from the kingdom in November on a pilgrimage, appointed Eleanor regent. On his return he made more formal arrangements, prior to his more prolonged departure for the crusade on 12 December, appointing as custodians his justiciar Hugh de Puiset together with William de Longchamp as &quot;summi justifiarii&quot;. Although Eleanor had no formal appointment in England during this time, they deferred to her authority. On 2 February 1190, Eleanor joined Richard at the Chateau of Bures, Normandy, where he continued to make preparations, and a family conclave was held at Nonancourt with John in attendance at which arrangements for the administration of England in the King&#x27;s absence were finalised.

Meanwhile, although John had married, the question of succession still remained, and in particular the problem of Alys to whom Richard was betrothed yet had been in a relationship with his father, but was also King Philip&#x27;s half-sister. It was during the spring of 1190 that negotiations began with the Navarrese House of Jiménez regarding Berengaria, daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre, though such an alliance would require the approval of Philip in breaking Richard&#x27;s betrothal. Such an alliance would serve the purpose of stabilising matters in Gascony. However, Richard and Philip finally departed on their crusade on 4 July 1190. Once Richard had set off, Eleanor sent Prince John to England while she travelled to Navarre, meeting the twenty-five-year-old Berengaria and her father at Pamplona. From there, she escorted Berengaria to Sicily, where Richard had arrived at Messina. In Messina, Richard found that his sister Joanna, widowed since November 1189, was being held prisoner. He was also in conflict with Philip, partly over the matter of Alys, as a result of which Eleanor&#x27;s ship was refused landing at Messina and had to proceed to Brindisi. By March 1191, Richard had secured Joanna&#x27;s release, and joined Eleanor and Berengaria at Reggio, from where the latter was placed in Joanna&#x27;s care. Richard then confronted Philip with the matter of Alys&#x27; relationship with Henry II as the reason for breaking the betrothal, and Philip promptly departed for the Holy Land prior to the arrival of Eleanor in Messina.

By the time Eleanor had reached Sicily, stories of misrule and conflict in England between Longchamp and Prince John had emerged. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was appointed to reestablish royal authority in England, and he and Eleanor began their return journey after only four days, departing on 2 April 1191 for Salerno. From there they travelled to Rome, arriving on the 14th to meet with the new Pope, Celestine III, to obtain his approval of appointing Walter de Coutances over William de Longchamp, who also served as a papal legate.

On 10 April 1191, Richard and Berengaria together with Joanna left Sicily, with the women on a separate ship, bound for Outremer, but storms diverted them to Cyprus where Richard and Berengaria were married on 12 May at Limasol, and Berengaria was crowned. They then sailed to the Holy land on 5 June, arriving at Acre on the 8th, which Richard captured. King Philip abandoned the Crusade on 2 July and returned to France, but in the meantime Richard had found himself in conflict with Duke Leopold of Austria, an event which would have serious consequences for him later.

===== Normandy and the struggle for power (1191–1192) =====

Once Eleanor reached Rouen, where she arrived on 24 June 1191, she was able to direct affairs in England better, although she spent the winter of 1191–1192 in France. Eleanor&#x27;s new role softened the criticisms she had accumulated. As regent, she demonstrated the qualities of a benevolent and statesmanlike ruler with Richard of Devizes describing her as &quot;incomparable&quot; and she began using the phrase &quot;teste me ipsa&quot; (as my own witness) on official documents. In England, while Coutance tried to restore order, Longchamp was eventually deposed and Prince John began to consolidate power, claiming he was the heir presumptive. Coutance was appointed head of a regency council and Longchamp fled to France, attempting unsuccessfully to recruit Eleanor to his cause. Her position became more complicated with the return of King Philip from the Holy Land in late 1191, who not only attempted to undermine Richard&#x27;s reputation but demanded the return of Alys, still in Eleanor&#x27;s care. In early 1192 Philip recruited Prince John to his cause, offering him lands and Alys, prompting Eleanor&#x27;s return to England on 11 February to prevent John&#x27;s invasion of Normandy, however she spent much of that year dealing with ecclesiastical disputes and successfully curbing the ambitions of Longchamp and John.

===== Raising a ransom and restoration of Richard I (1192–1194) =====

In the Holy Land, Richard made little progress in his quest to capture Jerusalem, and by late 1192 was forced to arrange a truce with Saladin, and sent Joanna and Berengaria back to Sicily in September, departing from Acre himself on 9 October. Following which his whereabouts were unknown till January 1193 when Eleanor learned that he had been taken prisoner by Duke Leopold, whom he had slighted on his arrival in Acre. Richard had travelled north from Trieste through Hungary, but when he crossed into Austria he was recognised, apprehended and taken to Dürnstein Castle. Leopold informed the Emperor, Henry VI who wrote to King Philip of France who in turn supported this turn of events. Eleanor only became aware of what had happened through Coutances&#x27; spies in France, but immediately assumed control of the government, while Prince John with Philip&#x27;s support, became emboldened once more in claiming the throne. Leopold handed over his prisoner to the Emperor in February, and he was moved to the castle of Trifels, while Eleanor unsuccessfully sought the intervention of the Pope. Eventually a truce was concluded with Prince John in April, but Eleanor also received a demand from the Emperor for 100,000 silver marks and the provision of hostages for Richard&#x27;s release. At the same time she received the first letter from him since his capture, urging her to accept the terms, and informing her that his conditions had much improved and that he had been transferred to Hagenau.

Eleanor and her council immediately set about trying to raise the ransom and arrange the hostages, a task to which Beregnaria, now in Poitou. contributed, largely through taxation of all of Richard&#x27;s territories and subjects. The first installment of 100,000 marks was delivered in October and the balance was raised by December. Having agreed to a date for Richard&#x27;s release on 17 January 1194, Eleanor and Coutances set off for Germany in December 1193, arriving at Speyer by the agreed day. There she discovered that King Philip and Prince John had outbid her in return for keeping Richard in custody. Further negotiations and offers, including an annual tribute, eventually led to him being released on 4 February. They immediately began their return, via Cologne, eventually arriving in Antwerp where they boarded the &quot;Trenchemer&quot; in the Scheldt, to avoid the French, landing in Sandwich on 12 March. Richard and Eleanor then made a triumphal entry into London on 23 March 1194.

===== Return to France and retirement (1194–1199) =====

Eleanor and Richard&#x27;s stay in England was relatively brief, since feeling the need to defend his French possessions from Philip, Richard departed from Portsmouth on 12 May 1194. Arriving in Barflueur, neither Richard nor Eleanor would return to England. There, they effected a reconciliation with Prince John that would last through the rest of Richard&#x27;s reign, leaving the latter free to defend his territory against Philip, while Eleanor, now seventy-two, retired to Fontevrault and there is very little information available about her for the next few years, though she made the abbey her principal residence for the rest of her life. The marriage of her daughter Joanna to Raymond VI of Toulouse in October 1196 finally ended Eleanor&#x27;s dynastic claims on Toulouse, which now passed to her daughter. Richard was in a state of almost perpetual war with the French King following his return to Normandy in 1194, and finally succumbed to a wound on 6 April 1199 at the age of forty-one, with Eleanor at his side.

Initially, prior to Richard arriving in England, he delegated authority to Eleanor &quot;statuendi quae vellet in regno&quot;, though this was not repeated. During Richard&#x27;s subsequent prolonged absences, royal authority in England was represented by a succession of chief justiciars. The justiciars included William de Longchamp (1190–1191), Hugh de Puiset (1189–1190), Walter de Coutances (1191–1193), and Hubert Walter (1193–1198). On Longchamp&#x27;s dismissal in 1191, government moved to a more conciliar mode (&quot;magnum concilium&quot; and &quot;communitas regni&quot;) under Coutance.

==== King John (1199–1204) ====

Richard and Berengaria had no children, and on Richard&#x27;s death, one of the first things Eleanor did was to warn John to flee from Brittany where he was with Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, Eleanor&#x27;s grandson, and secure Richard&#x27;s possessions. Arthur was the only son of Eleanor&#x27;s fourth son Geoffrey and his wife Constance. He had been considered to be Richard&#x27;s heir, being the son of John&#x27;s older brother, and hence had a claim on the throne, there being no other male heirs. Richard himself, though having considered Arthur, had declared John to be his successor prior to his death. King Philip was quick to exploit the possibility of an Angevin succession war, proclaiming the twelve-year-old Arthur as the new king, who in turn swore allegiance to Philip for his French possessions. Whereupon the Breton army advanced on Angers and captured it, followed by Anjou, Maine and Touraine declaring their allegiance to Arthur. Eleanor immediately acted to repel the Bretons, ordering the devastation of the lands of any vassal disloyal to John. Support for Arthur soon collapsed and he withdrew with Philip to Paris and John was officially invested as Duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199, while Eleanor toured all her domains raising support for John, whom she had declared the rightful heir and on 25 May 1199, John arrived in England and was crowned king on 27 May, although he was back in Normandy by 20 June where he concluded a truce.

At the same time, Eleanor also made peace with Philip and pledged her allegiance as a vassal. She had come to an arrangement with John, whereby she would officially declare him her heir and cede her French possessions to him, while retaining her right to them during her lifetime, as his &quot;domina&quot;. This helped to safeguard them from Philip in the event of her death. John and Isabella had no children, and he needed an heir to secure succession and in 1199, he had his marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity. In September that year Joanna died in childbirth, at Fontevrault, where she was buried, leaving Eleanor with only two surviving children, John of England and Eleanor of Castile. Despite their truce, conflict between John, Arthur and Philip continued intermittently, till a further arrangement was put in place at Le Mans sometime after Christmas 1199. Among other provisions, the new truce cemented dynastic alliances through the marriage of the twelve-year-old Louis, King Philip&#x27;s heir, to one of John&#x27;s nieces in Castile and the payment of 30,000 marks by John to Philip. This was formalised in the Treaty of Le Goulet of May 1200. Subsequently, John returned to England to raise the money, while Eleanor travelled to Castile to select a suitable bride. On the way she was kidnapped, just south of Poitiers, by Hugh IX of Lusignan, one of her vassals. Hugh demanded she cede him the county of La Marche, sold long ago by one of his ancestors to Henry II, which she acceded to so that she could complete her mission. She finally arrived in Castile by the end of January 1200.

Eleanor of Castile had two unmarried daughters, and of those Eleanor chose the younger, Blanche, then sixteen years old. She remained there till late March, to avoid Lent, during which marriages could not be solemnised, arriving in Bordeaux at Easter on 9 April. Travelling on to the Loire, she entrusted Blanche to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, who escorted her to meet King John, while Eleanor once more returned to Fontevrault. While there she undertook a major reconstruction of her ducal palace in Poitiers, originally Merovingian but now being rebuilt in the Angevin Style.

Blanche and Louis were married on 23 May 1200. She bore him 12 children, one of whom was the future Louis IX of France, ensuring that Eleanor&#x27;s descendants would be future rulers of France. John visited Eleanor at Fontevault in the early summer, hearing she was unwell. Amongst the advice she gave him was to secure the loyalty of her vassals, should she die, and in particular Hugh of Lusignan, to whom she had granted La Marche the previous year, making him the new count. John arrived at Lusignan Castle on 5 July, where he encountered the thirteen-year-old Isabelle of Angouleme and sought her hand in marriage from her parents, while breaking off negotiations with the Portuguese court. However, Isabelle was already betrothed to Hugh of Lusignan, whom he had dispatched to England. While there were potential political advantages to such an alliance, under the circumstances this was a mistake that would soon have serious consequences.

The marriage between John and Isabelle took place in secret in Bordeaux on 24 August, and they then proceeded to England, where she was crowned queen at Westminster Abbey on 8 October 1200. King John ignored the Lusignans&#x27; protests over the betrayal, whereupon they rose in rebellion in early 1201. Eleanor, though in ill health, once more intervened to restore peace in February and March, summoning Arthur as an intermediary with King Philip. But John continued to seek vengeance on the Lusignans, and conflict simmered throughout 1201.

On 28 April 1202, freed from some of his other commitments, Philip summoned John to his court, and upon his refusal declared him a traitor and in lieu of his lands. John&#x27;s position became more perilous when Philip betrothed his daughter Marie to the fifteen-year-old Arthur in July, and declared him to be the rightful lord of the Angevin possessions. Under Philip&#x27;s orders, Arthur proceeded to Poitou to seize his new inheritance. This prompted Eleanor to set out for Poitiers from Fontevrault, but on the way found herself besieged by Arthur and Hugh in Mirebeau Castle, near the Angevin border and just north of Poitiers. She refused demands to yield up control of the fortress and urgently summoned John to aid her. John received the news on 30 July and reached Mirebeau on 1 August where he found that the defences were already breached, but was able to lift the siege, release Eleanor and take both Arthur and the Lusignans into his custody. Arthur was last seen entering Falaise Castle in Normandy as a prisoner on 10 August. Eleanor had demanded a promise of clemency for Arthur, but little was heard of him for some time, despite an attempt to free him in the autumn of 1202. On her return to Fontevrault, Eleanor took the veil as a nun.

By the end of 1202, rumours were circulating about Arthur&#x27;s death, but John had the youth brought before him in January 1203 at Falaise, asking him to switch his allegiance from Philip. Instead, Arthur demanded that John grant to him all his possessions, according to Philip&#x27;s declaration. Arthur&#x27;s threats were sufficient for some of the King&#x27;s advisers to suggest he be eliminated, as a danger to the security of the realm. Rumours of his assassination persisted and subsequent events have been the matter of speculation, other than that he was transferred to Rouen on 8 March, and in April his gaoler announced he was relinquishing his role, which is the last record of his existence. John was commonly blamed for his nephew&#x27;s disappearance, and found himself increasingly isolated over the spring of 1203, providing an opportunity for Philip, who progressively annexed Normandy throughout the rest of the year, John leaving for England to muster support on 6 December. The French and Breton conquest of Normandy continued in early 1204, with most of the significant strongholds captured by the end of March. It is unclear if Eleanor was aware of the progressive destruction of the empire she and Henry II had ruled, and which she had fought to preserve for her sons. One source from Fontevrault suggests that she had become unaware of her surroundings during the last few months although this is either contradicted or not mentioned by other contemporary accounts.

=== Death and interment (1204) ===
Eleanor of Aquitaine, at the age of eighty, died at Fontevraud on either 31 March or 1 April 1204 and was entombed in the crypt of the abbey between Richard I and Henry II. The tomb effigy is by a different hand and more advanced in the use of three dimensions than the earlier two. Her daughter Joanna lay nearby.

Eleanor&#x27;s tomb lies under a painted stone &quot;gisant&quot; (effigy) of the Queen, wearing a crown and with an open book in her hands. The tomb is considered one of the finest of those few that survive from this period. During the French Revolution, the abbey was sacked and the tombs vandalised, while the human remains were exhumed and scattered and have never been located, although most of the tombs were later restored and lie in the church.

== Appearance ==

Contemporary sources praise Eleanor&#x27;s beauty. Even in an era when ladies of the nobility were excessively eulogised and praised, their praise of her was undoubtedly sincere, though probably based on hearsay, while is some cases, the reference is only implied. The medieval German songs known as &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; praise &quot;England&#x27;s Queen&quot;, and a minnesinger refers to &quot;The sweet young queen&quot;. Benoit de Sainte-Maure wrote of the &quot;Queen of Beauty and largesse&quot; in the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, while Philippe de Thaun wrote &quot;God save Lady Eleanor, Queen, who is the arbiter of honour, wit and beauty&quot;. When she was young, she was described as &quot;perpulchra&quot;—more than beautiful. When she was around 30, Bernard de Ventadour, a noted troubadour, called her &quot;gracious, lovely, the embodiment of charm&quot;, extolling her &quot;lovely eyes and noble countenance&quot; and declaring that she was &quot;one meet to crown the state of any king&quot;. William of Newburgh emphasised the charms of her person, and even in her old age Richard of Devizes described her as beautiful, while Matthew Paris, writing in the 13thcentury, recalled her &quot;admirable beauty&quot;, a common practice at the time, and &quot;a woman of wonderful appearance, more beautiful than moral&quot; and a &quot;wonderful lady, most beautiful and astute&quot;. Richard of Devizes was similarly exuberant, but not all were in agreement. William of Tyre dismissed her as &quot;&quot;uxorem quae una erat de fatuis mulieribus&quot;. Another chronicler describes her as &quot;avenante, vaillante, courtoise&quot;.
In spite of all these words of praise, no one left a detailed description of Eleanor, for instance the colour of her hair and eyes are unknown. Such details were of little interest to contemporary chroniclers, portraiture was not a characteristic of the time with no attempt at realism, while descriptions were largely rhetorical. Despite this, many biographers have attempted to describe her, and Elizabeth Chadwick dismisses all these as fantasy or based on misinformation. The effigy on her tomb (almost certainly not a true portrait) shows a tall and large-boned woman with brown skin. Her seal of shows a woman with a slender figure, but these were impersonal images intended to convey authority. Images of Eleanor are common throughout history but since there are none from her lifetime, these are purely speculative. Some romanesque carvings, such as those at the Cloisters in New York and Chartres and Bordeaux cathedrals have been attributed to her but these cannot be substantiated, while completely erroneous claims from medieval art have frequently been used to illustrate articles and books about her, such as a queen from the 14th century Codex Manesse. The stained glass window in Poitiers Cathedral with a donor portrait of Eleanor is not original but a nineteenth-century restoration by Adolphe Steinheil. Two of the commonest claims have been the fresco in the chapel of at St. Radegonde at Chinon and a donor portrait of a kneeling woman in a twelfth-century psalter, which has led to it becoming known as the Eleanor Psalter.

== Cultural depictions ==

=== Art ===

Many representations of Eleanor, or allusions to her, have appeared over the centuries, particularly the nineteenth-century revival of interest in their medieval past. In France, the Salles des Croisades at Versailles, opened in 1843, showed two 1839 paintings including Eleanor - &quot;St Bernard preaching the second crusade in the presence of King Louis VII and Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine&quot; by Emile Signol, and &quot;King Louis VII takes the Oriflamme&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Mauzaisse. In both, Eleanor is depicted in prayer. In contrast, British paintings including Frederick Sandys&#x27;s &quot;Queen Eleanor&quot; (1858) and Burne-Jones&#x27;s &quot;Fair Rosamund and Queen Eleanor&quot; (1861 and 1862), depict her as a melodramatic murderess, coincident with the popularity of the Fair Rosamond story, which in itself led to a series of art works. In the twentieth-century, similar works appeared by Herbert Sidney (&quot;Fair Rosamund&quot; 1905), Evelyn de Morgan (&quot;Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund&quot; 1905), John William Waterhouse (&quot;Fair Rosamund&quot; 1916) and Frank Cadogan Cowper (&quot;Fair Rosamund and Eleanor&quot; 1920).

In nineteenth-century France, Eleanor appears more as an authority figure. In the Poitiers Hôtel de Ville, there is a stained glass window in the Salon d&#x27;honneur by Adlphe Steinheil (), showing her issuing a charter to the city in 1199 (also a book cover). A similar image appears as a 1901 fresco by Charles Fouqueray in the Hôtel de Ville at Niort. Book covers and illustrations have been another medium by which interceptions of Eleanor have been shaped, specially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Examples include the works of Elizabeth Strickland and Celestia Bloss (1812–1855).

Judy Chicago&#x27;s installation &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1979) features a place setting for Eleanor. She was also commemorated on a French €0.50 postage stamp in 2004, the 800th anniversary of her death.

=== Fiction and poetry ===

There have been many fictionalised accounts of Eleanor over a long period of time. These include Jean Plaidy&#x27;s 1987 autobiographical &quot;The Courts of Love&quot; (fifth in the &#x27;Queens of England&#x27; series). Norah Lofts also wrote a fictionalized biography of her in 1955, entitled in various editions &quot;Queen in Waiting&quot; or &quot;Eleanor the Queen&quot;, and including some romanticized episodes—starting off with the young Eleanor planning to elope with a young knight, who is killed out of hand by her guardian, in order to facilitate her marriage to the King&#x27;s son. Kristiana Gregory wrote a fictionalised diary, &quot;Eleanor: Crown Jewel of Aquitaine&quot; (&quot;The Royal Diaries&quot; series, 2002) .

Eleanor also features in the works of many historical novelists. These include &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1883) by Howard Pyle as Queen Catherine and F. Marion Crawford&#x27;s novel of the second crusade &quot;Via Crucis&quot; (1899). She is the subject of &quot;A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver&quot;, a 1973 children&#x27;s novel by E. L. Konigsburg. and Margaret Ball&#x27;s &quot;Duchess of Aquitaine: A novel of Eleanor&quot; (2006).

In Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s Plantagenet novels, she figures prominently in &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot; (1995), &quot;Time and Chance&quot; (2002), and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2008), and also appears in &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2011) and &quot;A King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (2014), both of which focus on the reign of her son, Richard I, as King of England. Eleanor also appears briefly in the first novel of Penman&#x27;s Welsh trilogy, &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; (1985). In Penman&#x27;s historical Justin de Quincy mysteries, Eleanor, as Richard&#x27;s regent, sends squire Justin de Quincy on various missions, often an investigation of a situation involving Prince John. The four published mysteries are the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Man&quot; (1996), &quot;Cruel as the Grave&quot; (1998), &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; (2003), and &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (2005). Other novels include Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s Eleanor trilogy &quot;The Summer Queen&quot; (2013), &quot;The Winter Crown&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Autumn Throne&quot; (2016). Ariana Franklin features Eleanor in her Adelia Aguilar twelfth century mysteries. In 2008, in &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Tale&quot; (The Death Maze), in 2010 in &quot;A Murderous Procession&quot; (The Assassin&#x27;s Prayer) and 2020 in &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;. She is also a character in &quot;Matrix&quot; by Lauren Groff (2021).

Eleanor is also an allegorical figure in Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot;.

=== Drama, film, radio and television ===
Elinor is a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot;. Una Venning played the role in the &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot; television version of this in (1952) and Mary Morris in the BBC Shakespeare version (1984).

Eleanor has featured in a number of screen versions of the &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; stories. She has been played by Martita Hunt in &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), Jill Esmond in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1955–1960), Phyllis Neilson-Terry in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1958), Yvonne Mitchell in &quot;The Legend of Robin Hood&quot; (1975), Siân Phillips in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1997), Tusse Silberg in &quot;The New Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1997), Lynda Bellingham in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2006) and most recently by Eileen Atkins in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010).

Eleanor was played by Mary Clare in &quot;Becket&quot; (1923), and by Pamela Brown in the 1964 &quot;Becket&quot;. Henry II and Eleanor are the main characters in James Goldman&#x27;s 1966 play &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and Katharine Hepburn played Eleanor in the 1968 film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart played Eleanor and Henry in the 2003 version.

Eleanor was played by Prudence Hyman in &quot;Richard the Lionheart&quot; (1962), twice by Jane Lapotaire in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978) and again in Mike Walker&#x27;s BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Plantagenet&quot; (2010). In the 2014 film &quot;Richard the Lionheart: Rebellion&quot;, Eleanor is played by Debbie Rochon. In the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Eleanor Rising&quot; Rose Basista plays Eleanor and Joel MacCormack King Louis (2020–2022). These and other dramatic accounts have helped to perpetuate the Golden Myth image of Eleanor.

=== Music ===

Eleanor of Aquitaine is thought to be the &quot;chunegin von Engellant&quot; (Queen of England) mentioned in the 12th century poem &quot;Were diu werlt alle min&quot;,&quot; in Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. Queen Eleanor&#x27;s Confession, a traditional 17th century Child Ballad, is a fictional account of Eleanor, Henry II and William Marshal. Eleanor (as Eleonora di Guienna) and Rosamund Clifford, as well as Henry IIand Rosamund&#x27;s father, appear in Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Rosmonda d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; (libretto by Felice Romani) (1834). &quot;Flower and Hawk&quot; is a monodrama for soprano and orchestra, written by American composer Carlisle Floyd in 1972, in which Eleanor relives memories of her time as queen, and at the end hears the bells that toll for Henry&#x27;s death, and in turn, her freedom.

=== Video games ===

In the 2019 video game expansion &quot;Civilization VI: Gathering Storm&quot;, Eleanor is a playable leader for the English and French civilizations.

=== Issue ===

Eleanor had ten children, and outlived eight of them.

== Legacy ==

By the time of her death, Eleanor had outlived all of her children except for Queen Eleanor of Castile, who died in 1214 and King John of England, who died in 1216. Her descendants were rulers of England, France, Sicily, Castile, Jerusalem and the Holy Roman Empire. In England, her lineage would endure till 1485, with the death of Richard III.

Eleanor&#x27;s life has inspired a large canon of literature, reflected in popular culture. This has varied considerably from scholarly research to romantic fictionalised history, and everything in between. Nicholas Vincent writes that this includes &quot;the very worst historical writing devoted to the European Middle Ages&quot; and concludes that &quot;the Eleanor of history has been overshadowed by an Eleanor of wishful-thinking and make-believe&quot;. Legends about her started during her lifetime and rapidly grew, and much of it appears in the chronicles of the late twelfth century which constitute almost all that is known of her. Most of these paint her in an unfavourable light, yet none are actually first hand accounts. Many of the accounts of her life are composed &quot;so distant in time and place&quot; from the events as to have little credence, and chroniclers were more concerned with their messages than an accurate setting out of facts. These messages were often laden with ideology that in Eleanor&#x27;s case was largely negative. The aspects of her life most valued by modern romanticisation were those her contemporary commentators found most unacceptable in her position. Most of these were clerics, like William of Tyre, John of Salisbury, Mathew Paris, Helinand de Froidment and Aubri des Trois Fontaines and based their assessments on &quot;the common talk of the day&quot;. In this way, gossip and rumour, often prefaced by &quot;ut dicibatur&quot; (as it was said) became included in the records of the times and then into later histories and biographies. Among modern biographies, one of the first by Amy Kelly (1950), while relying on literary sources but not historical records is &quot;legend focussed&quot; and highly romanticised in a way that cannot be substantiated.

In the absence of much reliable information about Eleanor herself, biographers have largely focused on the people around her and the political and cultural events of her time. Her importance lies not so much on who she was, as what she was. In the words of one chronicler &quot;wife of two kings, and mother of three&quot;, while her longevity allowed her to be an influence on many people who had shorter life spans.

It was not uncommon in contemporary literature, for authors to dedicate their works to nobility, seeking favours, but this does not imply the latter were involved with or were responsible for the work being produced. But this has led to much speculation as to whether allusions to Eleanor appeared in such work. Thus, Philippe de Thaon presented a copy of his bestiary to Eleanor in 1154, including a dedication seeking her to use her influence on King Henry to advance his family interests.(Turner 2009) Layamon, in his translation of Wace&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, one of many retellings of the Arthurian legend, claimed it was dedicated to Eleanor.(Turner 2009) Eleanor&#x27;s daughter Marie commissioned Chrétien de Troyes to produce a French version of the legend.

<doc id="9963" wikidata="Q131104" url="?curid=9963" title="Epistle to Philemon">
<text>The Epistle to Philemon is one of the books of the Christian New Testament. It is a prison letter, authored by Paul the Apostle (the opening verse also mentions Timothy), to Philemon, a leader in the Colossian church. It deals with the themes of forgiveness and reconciliation. Paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as &quot;a prisoner of Jesus Christ&quot;, calling Timothy &quot;our brother&quot;, and addressing Philemon as &quot;fellow labourer&quot; and &quot;brother&quot; (). Onesimus, a slave who had escaped from his master Philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein Paul asked Philemon to receive him as a &quot;brother beloved&quot; ().

Philemon was a wealthy Christian, possibly a bishop of the church that met in his home () in Colossae. This letter is now generally regarded as one of the undisputed works of Paul. It is the shortest of Paul&#x27;s extant letters, consisting of only 335 words in the Greek text.

==Composition==
The Epistle to Philemon was composed around AD 57–62 by Paul while in prison at Caesarea Maritima (early date) or more likely from Rome (later date) in conjunction with the composition of Colossians.

===Authorship===
The Epistle to Philemon is attributed to the apostle Paul, and this attribution has rarely been questioned by scholars. Along with six others, it is numbered among the &quot;undisputed letters&quot;, which are widely considered to be authentically Pauline. The main challenge to the letter&#x27;s authenticity came from a group of German scholars in the nineteenth century known as the Tübingen School. Their leader, Ferdinand Christian Baur, only accepted four New Testament epistles as genuinely written by Paul: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians and Galatians. Commenting on Philemon, Baur described the subject matter as &quot;so very singular as to arouse our suspicions&quot;, and concluded that it is perhaps a &quot;Christian romance serving to convey a genuine Christian idea&quot;. This view is now largely considered to be outdated and finds no support in modern scholarship.

The opening verse of the salutation also names Timothy alongside Paul. This, however, does not mean that Timothy was the epistle&#x27;s co-author. Rather, Paul regularly mentions others in the address if they have a particular connection with the recipient. In this case, Timothy may have encountered Philemon while accompanying Paul in his work in Ephesus.

===Occasion===
According to the most common interpretation, Paul wrote this letter on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave who had wronged his owner Philemon. A slave running away was in and of itself illegal. It is often assumed that Onesimus had fled after stealing money, as Paul states in verse 18 that if Onesimus owes anything, Philemon should charge this to Paul&#x27;s account. Sometime after leaving, Onesimus came into contact with Paul, although again the details are unclear. He may have been arrested and imprisoned alongside Paul. Alternatively, he may have previously heard Paul&#x27;s name (as his owner was a Christian) and so travelled to him for help. After meeting Paul, Onesimus became a Christian believer. An affection grew between them, and Paul would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him. However, he considered it better to send him back to Philemon with an accompanying letter, which aimed to effect reconciliation between them as Christian brothers. The preservation of the letter suggests that Paul&#x27;s request was granted.

Onesimus&#x27; status as a fugitive slave was challenged by Allen Dwight Callahan in an article published in the &quot;Harvard Theological Review&quot; and in a later commentary. Callahan argues that, beyond verse 16, &quot;nothing in the text conclusively indicates that Onesimus was ever the chattel of the letter&#x27;s chief addressee. Moreover, the expectations fostered by the traditional fugitive slave hypothesis go unrealized in the letter. Modern commentators, even those committed to the prevailing interpretation, have tacitly admitted as much.&quot; Callahan argues that the earliest commentators on this work – the homily of Origen and the Anti-Marcion Preface – are silent about Onesimus&#x27; possible servile status, and traces the origins of this interpretation to John Chrysostom, who proposed it in his &quot;Homiliae in epistolam ad Philemonem&quot;, during his ministry in Antioch, circa 386–398. In place of the traditional interpretation, Callahan suggests that Onesimus and Philemon are brothers both by blood and religion, but who have become estranged, and the intent of this letter was to reconcile the two men. Ben Witherington III has challenged Callahan&#x27;s interpretation as a misreading of Paul&#x27;s rhetoric. Further, Margaret M. Mitchell has demonstrated that a number of writers before Chrysostom either argue or assume that Onesimus was a runaway slave, including Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea and Ambrosiaster.

However, from the standpoint of context, vs.12–16 do make it rather clear that he was a runaway slave. In v.14 Paul states he didn&#x27;t want to do anything without Philemon&#x27;s consent. Since Paul could have ordered or commanded Philemon to do it, but the fact that he desired his consent stands out. Also, Paul could have just kept Onesimus there, and Onesimus himself could have stayed there. Philemon would have had the right to hold his runaway slave accountable not just from a financial or social standpoint, but a legal standpoint. Onesimus, upon his return, could have legally been made a prisoner of Rome. Vs15-16 make it clear that Paul was asking Philemon to receive him back &quot;forever&quot; and &quot;no longer as a slave&quot; but as a &quot;beloved brother.&quot; Paul actually writes that it was perhaps God&#x27;s purpose that Onesimus initially ran away for the purpose of becoming a Christian and then return as a fellow Christian. Paul calls him &quot;his son&quot; (v.10) whom he &quot;begot while still in chains.&quot; The message to Philemon is to accept Onesimus back as the &quot;son&quot; of a &quot;prisoner of Jesus Christ.&quot; It appears that both Paul and Onesimus desired to do the right thing out of respect for Philemon, but also expecting Philemon to do the right thing as someone who had been graciously forgiven and received by the Lord...as a fellow &quot;prisoner of Christ Jesus.&quot;

The only extant information about Onesimus apart from this letter is found in Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Colossians 4:7–9, where Onesimus is called &quot;a faithful and beloved brother&quot;:

===Recipient===

The letter is addressed to Philemon, Apphia and Archippus, and the church in Philemon&#x27;s house. Philemon is described as a &quot;fellow worker&quot; of Paul. It is generally assumed that he lived in Colossae; in the letter to the Colossians, Onesimus (the slave who fled from Philemon) and Archippus (whom Paul greets in the letter to Philemon) are described as members of the church there. Philemon may have converted to Christianity through Paul&#x27;s ministry, possibly in Ephesus. Apphia in the salutation is probably Philemon&#x27;s wife. Her name () is possibly of Phrygian or Greek origin. Some have speculated that Archippus (), described by Paul as a &quot;fellow soldier&quot;, is the son of Philemon and Apphia.

The Scottish Pastor John Knox proposed that Onesimus&#x27; owner was in fact Archippus, and the letter was addressed to him rather than Philemon. In this reconstruction, Philemon would receive the letter first and then encourage Archippus to release Onesimus so that he could work alongside Paul. This view, however, has not found widespread support. In particular, Knox&#x27;s view has been challenged on the basis of the opening verses. According to O&#x27;Brien, the fact that Philemon&#x27;s name is mentioned first, together with the use of the phrase &quot;in your house&quot; in verse 2, makes it unlikely that Archippus was the primary addressee. Knox further argued that the letter was intended to be read aloud in the Colossian church in order to put pressure on Archippus. A number of commentators, however, see this view as contradicting the tone of the letter. J. B. Lightfoot, for example, wrote: &quot;The tact and delicacy of the Apostle&#x27;s pleading for Onesimus would be nullified at one stroke by the demand for publication.&quot;

==Content==

===Greeting and introduction (1–3)===
The opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other Pauline letters. Paul first introduces himself, with a self-designation as a &quot;prisoner of Jesus Christ,&quot; which in this case refers to a physical imprisonment. He also mentions his associate Timothy, as a valued colleague who was presumably known to the recipient. As well as addressing the letter to Philemon, Paul sends greetings to Apphia, Archippus and the church that meets in Philemon&#x27;s house. Apphia is often presumed to be Philemon&#x27;s wife and Archippus, a &quot;fellow labourer&quot;, is sometimes suggested to be their son. Paul concludes his salutation with a prayerful wish for grace and peace.

===Thanksgiving and intercession (4–7)===
Before addressing the main topic of the letter, Paul continues with a paragraph of thanksgiving and intercession. This serves to prepare the ground for Paul&#x27;s central request. He gives thanks to God for Philemon&#x27;s love and faith and prays for his faith to be effective. He concludes this paragraph by describing the joy and comfort he has received from knowing how Philemon has shown love towards the Christians in Colossae.
===Paul&#x27;s plea for Onesimus (8–20)===
As a background to his specific plea for Onesimus, Paul clarifies his intentions and circumstances. Although he has the boldness to command Philemon to do what would be right in the circumstances, he prefers to base his appeal on his knowledge of Philemon&#x27;s love and generosity. He also describes the affection he has for Onesimus and the transformation that has taken place with Onesimus&#x27;s conversion to the Christian faith. Where Onesimus was &quot;useless&quot;, now he is &quot;useful&quot; – a wordplay, as Onesimus means &quot;useful&quot;. Paul indicates that he would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him, but recognised that it was right to send him back. Paul&#x27;s specific request is for Philemon to welcome Onesimus as he would welcome Paul, namely as a Christian brother. He offers to pay for any debt created by Onesimus&#x27; departure and expresses his desire that Philemon might refresh his heart in Christ.

===Conclusion and greetings (21–25)===
In the final section of the letter, Paul describes his confidence that Philemon would do even more than he had requested, perhaps indicating his desire for Onesimus to return to work alongside him. He also mentions his wish to visit and asks Philemon to prepare a guest room. Paul sends greetings from five of his co-workers and concludes the letter with a benediction.

==Themes==
Paul uses slavery vs. freedom language more often in his writings as a metaphor. 

This letter may have provided some comfort to some slaves of the time.

Though its practice appears centrally, Paul does not share value judgements about the institution of slavery. Its influence could create pressures, as an “abolitionist would have been at the same time an insurrectionist, and the political effects of such a movement would have been unthinkable.&quot; Paul saw human institutions like slavery among many that in his apocalyptic view would soon go. 

When it comes to Onesimus and his circumstance as a slave, Paul felt that Onesimus should return to Philemon but not as a slave; rather, under a bond of familial love. Paul also was not suggesting that Onesimus be punished, in spite of the fact that Roman law allowed the owner of a runaway slave nearly unlimited privileges of punishment, even execution. This is a concern of Paul and a reason he is writing to Philemon, asking that Philemon accept Onesimus back in a bond of friendship, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Paul is undermining this example of a human institution which dehumanizes people. Onesimus, like Philemon, belongs to Christ, and so &quot;Christ, and not Philemon, has a claim on Onesimus&#x27; honor and obedience.&quot;

Verses 13–14 suggest that Paul wants Philemon to send Onesimus back to Paul (possibly freeing him for the purpose). Marshall, Travis and Paul write, &quot;Paul hoped that it might be possible for [Onesimus] to spend some time with him as a missionary colleague... If that is not a request for Onesimus to join Paul’s circle, I do not know what more would need to be said&quot;.

==Significance==

In order to better appreciate the Book of Philemon, it is necessary to be aware of the situation of the early Christian community in the Roman Empire; and the economic system of Classical Antiquity based on slavery. According to the Epistle to Diognetus: &quot;For the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe... They are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. They pass their days on earth, but they are citizens of heaven. They obey the prescribed laws, and at the same time surpass the laws by their lives&quot;.

Pope Benedict XVI refers to this letter in his encyclical letter, &quot;Spe salvi&quot;, highlighting the power of Christianity as power of the transformation of society:

<doc id="9966" wikidata="Q1048911" url="?curid=9966" title="Elliptic-curve cryptography">
<text>Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC allows smaller keys to provide equivalent security, compared to cryptosystems based on modular exponentiation in Galois fields, such as the RSA cryptosystem and ElGamal cryptosystem.

Elliptic curves are applicable for key agreement, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks. Indirectly, they can be used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme. They are also used in several integer factorization algorithms that have applications in cryptography, such as Lenstra elliptic-curve factorization.

== History ==

The use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller in 1985. Elliptic curve cryptography algorithms entered wide use in 2004 to 2005.

In 1999, NIST recommended fifteen elliptic curves. Specifically, FIPS 186-4 has ten recommended finite fields:
* Five prime fields formula_1 for certain primes &quot;p&quot; of sizes 192, 224, 256, 384, and bits. For each of the prime fields, one elliptic curve is recommended.
* Five binary fields formula_2 for &quot;m&quot; equal 163, 233, 283, 409, and 571. For each of the binary fields, one elliptic curve and one Koblitz curve was selected.

The NIST recommendation thus contains a total of five prime curves and ten binary curves. The curves were chosen for optimal security and implementation efficiency.

At the RSA Conference 2005, the National Security Agency (NSA) announced Suite B, which exclusively uses ECC for digital signature generation and key exchange. The suite is intended to protect both classified and unclassified national security systems and information. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has endorsed elliptic curve cryptography in its Suite B set of recommended algorithms, specifically elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for digital signature. The NSA allows their use for protecting information classified up to top secret with 384-bit keys.

Recently, a large number of cryptographic primitives based on bilinear mappings on various elliptic curve groups, such as the Weil and Tate pairings, have been introduced. Schemes based on these primitives provide efficient identity-based encryption as well as pairing-based signatures, signcryption, key agreement, and proxy re-encryption.

Elliptic curve cryptography is used successfully in numerous popular protocols, such as Transport Layer Security and Bitcoin.

=== Security concerns ===

In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (or Dual_EC_DRBG) had been included as a NIST national standard due to the influence of NSA, which had included a deliberate weakness in the algorithm and the recommended elliptic curve. RSA Security in September 2013 issued an advisory recommending that its customers discontinue using any software based on Dual_EC_DRBG. In the wake of the exposure of Dual_EC_DRBG as &quot;an NSA undercover operation&quot;, cryptography experts have also expressed concern over the security of the NIST recommended elliptic curves, suggesting a return to encryption based on non-elliptic-curve groups.

Additionally, in August 2015, the NSA announced that it plans to replace Suite B with a new cipher suite due to concerns about quantum computing attacks on ECC.

=== Patents ===
While the RSA patent expired in 2000, there may be patents in force covering certain aspects of ECC technology, including at least one ECC scheme (ECMQV). However, RSA Laboratories and Daniel J. Bernstein have argued that the US government elliptic curve digital signature standard (ECDSA; NIST FIPS 186-3) and certain practical ECC-based key exchange schemes (including ECDH) can be implemented without infringing those patents.

== Elliptic curve theory ==
For the purposes of this article, an &quot;elliptic curve&quot; is a plane curve over a finite field (rather than the real numbers) which consists of the points satisfying the equation:

: formula_3

along with a distinguished point at infinity, denoted ∞. The coordinates here are to be chosen from a fixed finite field of characteristic not equal to 2 or 3, or the curve equation would be somewhat more complicated.

This set of points, together with the group operation of elliptic curves, is an abelian group, with the point at infinity as an identity element. The structure of the group is inherited from the divisor group of the underlying algebraic variety:

: formula_4

=== Application to cryptography ===
Public-key cryptography is based on the intractability of certain mathematical problems. Early public-key systems, such as RSA&#x27;s 1983 patent, based their security on the assumption that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two or more large prime factors which are far apart. For later elliptic-curve-based protocols, the base assumption is that finding the discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve element with respect to a publicly known base point is infeasible (the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption): this is the &quot;elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem&quot; (ECDLP). The security of elliptic curve cryptography depends on the ability to compute a point multiplication and the inability to compute the multiplicand given the original point and product point. The size of the elliptic curve, measured by the total number of discrete integer pairs satisfying the curve equation, determines the difficulty of the problem.

The primary benefit promised by elliptic curve cryptography over alternatives such as RSA is a smaller key size, reducing storage and transmission requirements. For example, a 256-bit elliptic curve public key should provide comparable security to a 3072-bit RSA public key.

=== Cryptographic schemes ===
Several discrete logarithm-based protocols have been adapted to elliptic curves, replacing the group formula_5 with an elliptic curve:
* The Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme is based on the Diffie–Hellman scheme,
* The Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), also known as Elliptic Curve Augmented Encryption Scheme or simply the Elliptic Curve Encryption Scheme,

== Implementation ==
Some common implementation considerations include:

=== Domain parameters === 
To use ECC, all parties must agree on all the elements defining the elliptic curve, that is, the &quot;domain parameters&quot; of the scheme. The size of the field used is typically either prime (and denoted as p) or is a power of two (formula_6); the latter case is called &quot;the binary case&quot;, and this case necessitates the choice of an auxiliary curve denoted by &quot;f&quot;. Thus the field is defined by &quot;p&quot; in the prime case and the pair of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;f&quot; in the binary case. The elliptic curve is defined by the constants &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; used in its defining equation. Finally, the cyclic subgroup is defined by its generator (a.k.a. &quot;base point&quot;) &quot;G&quot;. For cryptographic application, the order of &quot;G&quot;, that is the smallest positive number &quot;n&quot; such that formula_7 (the point at infinity of the curve, and the identity element), is normally prime. Since &quot;n&quot; is the size of a subgroup of formula_8 it follows from Lagrange&#x27;s theorem that the number formula_9 is an integer. In cryptographic applications, this number &quot;h&quot;, called the &quot;cofactor&quot;, must be small (formula_10) and, preferably, formula_11. To summarize: in the prime case, the domain parameters are formula_12; in the binary case, they are formula_13.

Unless there is an assurance that domain parameters were generated by a party trusted with respect to their use, the domain parameters &quot;must&quot; be validated before use.

The generation of domain parameters is not usually done by each participant because this involves computing the number of points on a curve which is time-consuming and troublesome to implement. As a result, several standard bodies published domain parameters of elliptic curves for several common field sizes. Such domain parameters are commonly known as &quot;standard curves&quot; or &quot;named curves&quot;; a named curve can be referenced either by name or by the unique object identifier defined in the standard documents:
* NIST, Recommended Elliptic Curves for Government Use
* SECG, SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters
* ECC Brainpool (), ECC Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation
SECG test vectors are also available. NIST has approved many SECG curves, so there is a significant overlap between the specifications published by NIST and SECG. EC domain parameters may be specified either by value or by name.

If, despite the preceding admonition, one decides to construct one&#x27;s own domain parameters, one should select the underlying field and then use one of the following strategies to find a curve with appropriate (i.e., near prime) number of points using one of the following methods:
* Select a random curve and use a general point-counting algorithm, for example, Schoof&#x27;s algorithm or the Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm,
* Select a random curve from a family which allows easy calculation of the number of points (e.g., Koblitz curves), or
* Select the number of points and generate a curve with this number of points using the &quot;complex multiplication&quot; technique.

Several classes of curves are weak and should be avoided:
* Curves over formula_2 with non-prime &quot;m&quot; are vulnerable to Weil descent attacks.
* Curves such that &quot;n&quot; divides formula_15 (where &quot;p&quot; is the characteristic of the field: &quot;q&quot; for a prime field, or formula_16 for a binary field) for sufficiently small &quot;B&quot; are vulnerable to Menezes–Okamoto–Vanstone (MOV) attack which applies usual discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in a small-degree extension field of formula_1 to solve ECDLP. The bound &quot;B&quot; should be chosen so that discrete logarithms in the field formula_18 are at least as difficult to compute as discrete logs on the elliptic curve formula_19.
* Curves such that formula_20 are vulnerable to the attack that maps the points on the curve to the additive group of formula_21.

=== Key sizes ===
Because all the fastest known algorithms that allow one to solve the ECDLP (baby-step giant-step, Pollard&#x27;s rho, etc.), need formula_22 steps, it follows that the size of the underlying field should be roughly twice the security parameter. For example, for 128-bit security one needs a curve over formula_21, where formula_24. This can be contrasted with finite-field cryptography (e.g., DSA) which requires 3072-bit public keys and 256-bit private keys, and integer factorization cryptography (e.g., RSA) which requires a 3072-bit value of &quot;n&quot;, where the private key should be just as large. However, the public key may be smaller to accommodate efficient encryption, especially when processing power is limited.

The hardest ECC scheme (publicly) broken to date had a 112-bit key for the prime field case and a 109-bit key for the binary field case. For the prime field case, this was broken in July 2009 using a cluster of over 200 PlayStation 3 game consoles and could have been finished in 3.5 months using this cluster when running continuously. The binary field case was broken in April 2004 using 2600 computers over 17 months.

A current project is aiming at breaking the ECC2K-130 challenge by Certicom, by using a wide range of different hardware: CPUs, GPUs, FPGA.

=== Projective coordinates ===
A close examination of the addition rules shows that in order to add two points, one needs not only several additions and multiplications in formula_21 but also an inversion operation. The inversion (for given formula_26 find formula_27 such that formula_28) is one to two orders of magnitude slower than multiplication. However, points on a curve can be represented in different coordinate systems which do not require an inversion operation to add two points. Several such systems were proposed: in the &quot;projective&quot; system each point is represented by three coordinates formula_29 using the following relation: formula_30, formula_31; in the &quot;Jacobian system&quot; a point is also represented with three coordinates formula_29, but a different relation is used: formula_33, formula_34; in the &quot;López–Dahab system&quot; the relation is formula_30, formula_36; in the &quot;modified Jacobian&quot; system the same relations are used but four coordinates are stored and used for calculations formula_37; and in the &quot;Chudnovsky Jacobian&quot; system five coordinates are used formula_38. Note that there may be different naming conventions, for example, IEEE P1363-2000 standard uses &quot;projective coordinates&quot; to refer to what is commonly called Jacobian coordinates. An additional speed-up is possible if mixed coordinates are used.

=== Fast reduction (NIST curves) ===
Reduction modulo &quot;p&quot; (which is needed for addition and multiplication) can be executed much faster if the prime &quot;p&quot; is a pseudo-Mersenne prime, that is formula_39; for example, formula_40 or formula_41 Compared to Barrett reduction, there can be an order of magnitude speed-up. The speed-up here is a practical rather than theoretical one, and derives from the fact that the moduli of numbers against numbers near powers of two can be performed efficiently by computers operating on binary numbers with bitwise operations.

The curves over formula_1 with pseudo-Mersenne &quot;p&quot; are recommended by NIST. Yet another advantage of the NIST curves is that they use &quot;a&quot; = −3, which improves addition in Jacobian coordinates.

According to Bernstein and Lange, many of the efficiency-related decisions in NIST FIPS 186-2 are suboptimal. Other curves are more secure and run just as fast.

== Security ==

=== Side-channel attacks ===
Unlike most other DLP systems (where it is possible to use the same procedure for squaring and multiplication), the EC addition is significantly different for doubling (&quot;P&quot; = &quot;Q&quot;) and general addition (&quot;P&quot; ≠ &quot;Q&quot;) depending on the coordinate system used. Consequently, it is important to counteract side-channel attacks (e.g., timing or simple/differential power analysis attacks) using, for example, fixed pattern window (a.k.a. comb) methods (note that this does not increase computation time). Alternatively one can use an Edwards curve; this is a special family of elliptic curves for which doubling and addition can be done with the same operation. Another concern for ECC-systems is the danger of fault attacks, especially when running on smart cards.

=== Backdoors ===
Cryptographic experts have expressed concerns that the National Security Agency has inserted a kleptographic backdoor into at least one elliptic curve-based pseudo random generator. Internal memos leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden suggest that the NSA put a backdoor in the Dual EC DRBG standard. One analysis of the possible backdoor concluded that an adversary in possession of the algorithm&#x27;s secret key could obtain encryption keys given only 32 bytes of PRNG output.

The SafeCurves project has been launched in order to catalog curves that are easy to implement securely and are designed in a fully publicly verifiable way to minimize the chance of a backdoor.

=== Quantum computing attack ===
Shor&#x27;s algorithm can be used to break elliptic curve cryptography by computing discrete logarithms on a hypothetical quantum computer. The latest quantum resource estimates for breaking a curve with a 256-bit modulus (128-bit security level) are 2330 qubits and 126 billion Toffoli gates. For the binary elliptic curve case, 906 qubits are necessary (to break 128 bits of security). In comparison, using Shor&#x27;s algorithm to break the RSA algorithm requires 4098 qubits and 5.2 trillion Toffoli gates for a 2048-bit RSA key, suggesting that ECC is an easier target for quantum computers than RSA. All of these figures vastly exceed any quantum computer that has ever been built, and estimates place the creation of such computers at a decade or more away.

Supersingular Isogeny Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange claimed to provide a post-quantum secure form of elliptic curve cryptography by using isogenies to implement Diffie–Hellman key exchanges. This key exchange uses much of the same field arithmetic as existing elliptic curve cryptography and requires computational and transmission overhead similar to many currently used public key systems. However, new classical attacks undermined the security of this protocol.

In August 2015, the NSA announced that it planned to transition &quot;in the not distant future&quot; to a new cipher suite that is resistant to quantum attacks. &quot;Unfortunately, the growth of elliptic curve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research on quantum computing, necessitating a re-evaluation of our cryptographic strategy.&quot;

=== Invalid curve attack ===

When ECC is used in virtual machines, an attacker may use an invalid curve to get a complete PDH private key.

<doc id="9970" wikidata="Q5349079" url="?curid=9970" title="Eightfold path (policy analysis)">
<text>The eightfold path is a method of policy analysis assembled by Eugene Bardach, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. It is outlined in his book &quot;A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving&quot;, which is now in its seventh edition. The book is commonly referenced in public policy and public administration scholarship.

Bardach&#x27;s procedure is as follows:
# Define the problem
# Assemble the evidence
# Construct the alternatives
# Select the criteria
# Project the outcomes
# Confront the trade-offs
# Decide
# Tell your story

A possible ninth step, based on Bardach&#x27;s own writing, might be &quot;repeat steps 1–8 as necessary.&quot;

The method is named after the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path, but otherwise has no relation to it.

== New York taxi driver test ==
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.

<doc id="9971" wikidata="Q596642" url="?curid=9971" title="Eden Project">
<text>The Eden Project () is a visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The project is located in a reclaimed china clay pit.

The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant species, and each enclosure emulates a natural biome. The biomes consist of hundreds of hexagonal and pentagonal ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) inflated cells supported by geodesic tubular steel domes. The larger of the two biomes simulates a rainforest environment (and is the largest indoor rainforest in the world) and the second, a Mediterranean environment.

The attraction also has an outside botanical garden which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.

There are plans to build an Eden Project North in the seaside town of Morecambe, Lancashire, with a focus on the marine environment.

== History ==

The clay pit in which the project is sited was in use for over 160 years. In 1981, the pit was used by the BBC as the planet surface of Magrathea in the TV series &quot;the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. By the mid-1990s the pit was all but exhausted.

The initial idea for the project dates back to 1996, with construction beginning in 1998. The work was hampered by torrential rain in the first few months of the project, and parts of the pit flooded as it sits below the water table.

The first part of the Eden Project, the visitor centre, opened to the public in May 2000. The first plants began arriving in September of that year, and the full site opened on 17 March 2001.

To counter criticism from environmental groups, the Eden Project committed to investigate a rail link to the site. The rail link was never built, and car parking on the site is still funded from revenue generated from general admission ticket sales. A bus service links the site to St Austell railway station, on the Cornish Main Line.

The Eden Project was used as a filming location for the 2002 James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. On 2 July 2005 The Eden Project hosted the &quot;Africa Calling&quot; concert of the Live 8 concert series. It has also provided some plants for the British Museum&#x27;s Africa garden.

In 2005, the Project launched &quot;A Time of Gifts&quot; for the winter months, November to February. This features an ice rink covering the lake, with a small café-bar attached, as well as a Christmas market. Cornish choirs regularly perform in the biomes.

In 2007, the Eden Project campaigned unsuccessfully for £50 million in Big Lottery Fund money for a proposed desert biome. It received just 12.07% of the votes, the lowest for the four projects being considered. As part of the campaign, the Eden Project invited people all over Cornwall to try to break the world record for the biggest ever pub quiz as part of its campaign to bring £50 million of lottery funds to Cornwall.

In December 2009, much of the project, including both greenhouses, became available to navigate through Google Street View.

The Eden Trust revealed a trading loss of £1.3 million for 2012–13, on a turnover of £25.4 million. The Eden Project had posted a surplus of £136,000 for the previous year. In 2014 Eden accounts showed a surplus of £2 million.

The World Pasty Championships, an international competition to find the best Cornish pasties and other pasty-type savoury snacks, have been held at the Eden Project since 2012.

The Eden Project is said to have contributed over £1 billion to the Cornish economy. In 2016, Eden became home to Europe&#x27;s second-largest redwood forest (after the Giants Grove at Birr Castle, Birr Castle, Ireland) when forty saplings of coast redwoods, &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;, which could live for 4,000 years and reach 115 metres in height, were planted there.

The Eden Project received 1,010,095 visitors in 2019.

In December 2020 the project was closed after heavy rain caused several landslips at the site. Managers at the site are assessing the damage and will announce when the project will reopen on the company&#x27;s website. Reopening became irrelevant as Covid lockdown measures in the UK indefinitely closed the venue from early 2021, though it had reopened by May 2021 after remedial works had taken place. The site was used for an event during the 2021 G7 Summit, hosted by the United Kingdom.

== Design and construction ==
The project was conceived by Tim Smit and Jonathan Ball, and designed by Grimshaw Architects and structural engineering firm Anthony Hunt Associates (now part of Sinclair Knight Merz). Davis Langdon carried out the project management, Sir Robert McAlpine and Alfred McAlpine did the construction, MERO jointly designed and built the biome steel structures, the ETFE pillows that build the façade were realized by Vector Foiltec, and Arup was the services engineer, economic consultant, environmental engineer and transportation engineer. Land Use Consultants led the masterplan and landscape design. The project took 2½ years to construct and opened to the public on 17 March 2001.

== Site ==
=== Layout ===

Once into the attraction, there is a meandering path with views of the two biomes, planted landscapes, including vegetable gardens, and sculptures that include a giant bee and previously The WEEE Man (removed in 2016), a towering figure made from old electrical appliances and was meant to represent the average electrical waste used by one person in a lifetime.

=== Biomes ===
At the bottom of the pit are two covered biomes:

The Rainforest Biome, covers and measures high, wide, and long. It is used for tropical plants, such as fruiting banana plants, coffee, rubber, and giant bamboo, and is kept at a tropical temperature and moisture level.
The Mediterranean Biome covers and measures high, wide, and long. It houses familiar warm temperate and arid plants such as olives and grape vines and various sculptures.

The Outdoor Gardens represent the temperate regions of the world with plants such as tea, lavender, hops, hemp, and sunflowers, as well as local plant species.

The covered biomes are constructed from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels made from the thermoplastic ETFE. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin UV-transparent ETFE film, which are sealed around their perimeter and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a thermal blanket to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by abseilers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and takes the form of a geodesic structure. The panels vary in size up to across, with the largest at the top of the structure.

The ETFE technology was supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec, which is also responsible for ongoing maintenance of the cladding. The steel spaceframe and cladding package (with Vector Foiltec as ETFE subcontractor) was designed, supplied and installed by MERO (UK) PLC, who also jointly developed the overall scheme geometry with the architect, Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners.

The entire build project was managed by McAlpine Joint Venture.
=== The Core ===

The Core is the latest addition to the site and opened in September 2005. It provides the Eden Project with an education facility, incorporating classrooms and exhibition spaces designed to help communicate Eden&#x27;s central message about the relationship between people and plants. Accordingly, the building has taken its inspiration from plants, most noticeable in the form of the soaring timber roof, which gives the building its distinctive shape.

Grimshaw developed the geometry of the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers SKM Anthony Hunts. It is derived from phyllotaxis, which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the &quot;opposing spirals&quot; found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower&#x27;s head, pine cones, and pineapples. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with Rio Tinto to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and acoustic, mechanical, and electrical engineering design was carried out by Buro Happold.

==== Art at The Core ====

The Core is also home to art exhibitions throughout the year. A permanent installation entitled &quot;Seed&quot;, by Peter Randall-Page, occupies the anteroom. &quot;Seed&quot; is a large, 70 tonne egg-shaped installation, carved from a single block of granite from De Lank Quarry on Bodmin Moor, standing some tall and displaying a complex pattern of protrusions that are based upon the geometric and mathematical principles that underlie plant growth.

== Environmental aspects ==
The biomes provide diverse growing conditions, and many plants are on display.

The Eden Project includes environmental education focusing on the interdependence of plants and people; plants are labelled with their medicinal uses. The massive amounts of water required to create the humid conditions of the Tropical Biome, and to serve the toilet facilities, are all sanitised rain water that would otherwise collect at the bottom of the quarry. The only mains water used is for hand washing and for cooking. The complex also uses Green Tariff Electricity – some of the energy comes from one of the many wind turbines in Cornwall, which were among the first in Europe.

In December 2010 the Eden Project received permission to build a geothermal electricity plant which will generate approx 4MWe, enough to supply Eden and about 5000 households. The project will involve geothermal heating as well as geothermal electricity. Cornwall Council and the European Union came up with the greater part of £16.8m required to start the project. First a well will be sunk nearly 3 miles (4.5 km) into the granite crust underneath Eden.

Eden co-founder, Sir Tim Smit said, &quot;Since we began, Eden has had a dream that the world should be powered by renewable energy. The sun can provide massive solar power and the wind has been harnessed by humankind for thousands of years, but because both are intermittent and battery technology cannot yet store all we need there is a gap. We believe the answer lies beneath our feet in the heat underground that can be accessed by drilling technology that pumps water towards the centre of the Earth and brings it back up superheated to provide us with heat and electricity&quot;.

Drilling began in May 2021, and heating of the biomes began in 2023, using 85°C.

== Other projects ==

=== Eden Project Morecambe ===
In 2018, the Eden Project revealed its design for a new version of the project, located on the seafront in Morecambe, Lancashire. There will be biomes shaped like mussels and a focus on the marine environment. There will also be reimagined lidos, gardens, performance spaces, immersive experiences, and observatories.

Grimshaw are the architects for the project, which is expected to cost £80 million. The project is a partnership with the Lancashire Enterprise Partnership, Lancaster University, Lancashire County Council, and Lancaster City Council. In December 2018, the four local partners agreed to provide £1 million to develop the idea, which allowed the development of an outline planning application for the project. It is expected that there will be 500 jobs created and 8,000 visitors a day to the site.

Having been granted planning permission in January 2022 and with £50 million of levelling-up funding granted in January 2023, it is due to open in 2026 and predicted to benefit the North West economy by £200 million per year. In July 2024, Lancaster City Council received the first £2.5m of a promised £50m in UK government funding for the scheme. The grant would be used to appoint a main contractor to develop the designs for Eden Project Morecambe.

===Eden Project Dundee===
In May 2020, the Eden Project revealed plans to establish their first attraction in Scotland, and named Dundee as the proposed site of the location. The city&#x27;s Camperdown Park was widely touted to be the proposed location of the new attraction however in May 2021, it was announced that the Eden Project had chosen the site of the former gasworks in Dundee as the location. It was planned that the new development would result in 200 new jobs and &quot;contribute £27m a year to the regional economy&quot;. The project is in partnership with Dundee City Council, the University of Dundee and the Northwood Charitable Trust.

In 2021, Eden Project announced that they would establish fourteen hectares of new wildflower habitat in areas across Dundee, including Morgan Academy and Caird Park.

In July 2023, new images were released depicting what the Dundee attraction would look which accompanied the planning permission documents for the new attraction which would be submitted by autumn 2023.

Planning permission for the project was approved by Dundee City Council in June 2024.

===South Downs===
In 2020, Eastbourne Borough Council and the Eden Project announced a joint project to explore the viability of a new Eden site in the South Downs National Park.

===Qingdao, China===
In 2015, the Eden Project announced that it had reached an agreement to construct an Eden site in Qingdao, China. While the site had originally been slated to open by 2020, construction fell behind schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the opening date was delayed to 2023. The new site is expected to focus on &quot;water&quot; and its central role in civilization and nature.

===Eden Project New Zealand===
A planned Eden Project for the New Zealand city of Christchurch, to be called Eden Project New Zealand/Eden Project Aotearoa, was expected to be inaugurated in 2025. It was to be centred close to the Avon River, on a site largely razed as a result of the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake. The project has since been cancelled.

Since 2002, the Project has hosted a series of musical performances, called the Eden Sessions, usually held during the summer. The 2020 sessions were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were rescheduled as the 2022 sessions lineup.

The 2025 sessions will be headlined by Texas, Gary Barlow, The Script, Deftones, Biffy Clyro and Madness.

=== Lineup history ===
== In the media ==
The Eden Project has appeared in various television shows and films such as the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;The Bad Education Movie&quot;, in the Netflix series &quot;The Last Bus&quot;, in the CBeebies show &quot;Andy&#x27;s Aquatic Adventure&quot; and in Armenia’s postcard in the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest 2023&quot;.

A weekly radio show called &quot;The Eden Radio Project&quot; is held every Thursday afternoon on CHAOS Radio, formerly known as Radio St Austell Bay.

On 18 November 2019, on the &quot;Trees A Crowd&quot; podcast, David Oakes interviewed Eden Project&#x27;s Head of Interpretation, Dr Jo Elworthy, about the site.

<text>The European Commission (EC) is the primary executive arm of the European Union (EU). It operates as a cabinet government, with a number of members of the Commission (directorial system, informally known as &quot;Commissioners&quot;) corresponding to two thirds of the number of member states, unless the European Council, acting unanimously, decides to alter this number. The current number of Commissioners is 27, including the President. It includes an administrative body of about 32,000 European civil servants. The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries each headed by a Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner.

Currently, there is one member per member state, but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. The Commission President (currently Ursula von der Leyen) is proposed by the European Council (the 27 heads of state/governments) and elected by the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President, and the 27 members as a team are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission II, which took office in December 2024, following the European Parliament elections in June of the same year.

==History==

The European Commission derives from one of the five key institutions created in the supranational European Community system, following the proposal of Robert Schuman, French Foreign Minister, on 9 May 1950. Originating in 1951 as the High Authority in the European Coal and Steel Community, the commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under various presidents, involving three Communities.

===Establishment===
The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine-member &quot;High Authority&quot; under President Jean Monnet (see Monnet Authority). The High Authority was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg City. In 1958, the Treaties of Rome had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). However, their executives were called &quot;Commissions&quot; rather than &quot;High Authorities&quot;. The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the Council. Some states, such as France, expressed reservations over the power of the High Authority and wished to limit it by giving more power to the Council rather than the new executives.
Louis Armand led the first Commission of Euratom. Walter Hallstein led the first Commission of the EEC, holding the first formal meeting on 16 January 1958 at the Château of Val-Duchesse. It achieved agreement on a contentious cereal price accord, as well as making a positive impression upon third countries when it made its international debut at the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. Hallstein notably began the consolidation of European law and started to have a notable impact on national legislation. Little heed was taken of his administration at first but, with help from the European Court of Justice, his Commission stamped its authority solidly enough to allow future Commissions to be taken more seriously. In 1965, however, accumulating differences between the French government of Charles de Gaulle and the other member states on various subjects (British entry, direct elections to Parliament, the Fouchet Plan and the budget) triggered the &quot;empty chair&quot; crisis, ostensibly over proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy. Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year, it cost Étienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency, despite his otherwise being viewed as the most &#x27;dynamic&#x27; leader until Jacques Delors.

===Early development===
The three bodies, collectively named the European Executives, co-existed until 1 July 1967 when, under the Merger Treaty, they were combined into a single administration under President Jean Rey. Owing to the merger, the Rey Commission saw a temporary increase to 14 members—although subsequent Commissions were reduced back to nine, following the formula of one member for small states and two for larger states. The Rey Commission completed the Community&#x27;s customs union in 1968 and campaigned for a more powerful, elected, European Parliament. Despite Rey being the first President of the combined communities, Hallstein is seen as the first President of the modern Commission.

The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions followed with work on monetary co-operation and the first enlargement to the north in 1973. With that enlargement, the College of Commissioners membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time. The external representation of the Community took a step forward when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Labour government, became the first President to attend a G8 summit on behalf of the Community. Following the Jenkins Commission, Gaston Thorn&#x27;s Commission oversaw the Community&#x27;s enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act.

===Jacques Delors===
The Commission headed by Jacques Delors was seen as giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism. Delors and his College are also considered as the &quot;founding fathers of the euro&quot;. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992: &quot;Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known former French finance minister, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary, and political union&quot;.

===Jacques Santer===

The successor to Delors was Jacques Santer. As a result of a fraud and corruption scandal, the entire Santer Commission was forced by the Parliament to resign in 1999. These frauds were revealed by internal auditor Paul van Buitenen, with French commissioner Édith Cresson being the main target of the allegations.

That was the first time a College of Commissioners had been forced to resign &quot;en masse&quot;, and represented a shift of power towards the Parliament. However, the Santer Commission did carry out work on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the euro. In response to the scandal, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) was created.

===Romano Prodi===

Following Santer, Romano Prodi took office. The Amsterdam Treaty had increased the commission&#x27;s powers and Prodi was dubbed by the press as something akin to a Prime Minister. Powers were strengthened again; the Treaty of Nice, signed in 2001, gave the Presidents more power over the composition of the College of Commissioners.

===José Manuel Barroso===

José Manuel Barroso became president in 2004: the Parliament once again asserted itself in objecting to the proposed membership of the Barroso Commission. Owing to this opposition, Barroso was forced to reshuffle his College before taking office. The Barroso Commission was also the first full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members; hence, the number of Commissioners at the end of the Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.

Allegations of fraud and corruption were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis. A Commission officer, Guido Strack, reported alleged fraud and abuses in his department in the years 2002–2004 to OLAF, and was fired as a result. In 2008, Paul van Buitenen (the former auditor known from the Santer Commission scandal) accused the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of a lack of independence and effectiveness.

Barroso&#x27;s first Commission term expired on 31 October 2009. Under the Treaty of Nice, the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached 27 would have to be reduced to &quot;less than the number of Member States&quot;. The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the European Council, and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007, this clause took effect for the next Commission. The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two-thirds of member-states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise. Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards. However, according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members, thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative – the so-called 26+1 formula. This guarantee (which may find its way into the next treaty amendment, probably in an accession treaty) contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009.

Lisbon also combined the posts of European Commissioner for External Relations with the council&#x27;s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This post, also a Vice-president of the Commission, would chair the Council of the European Union&#x27;s foreign affairs meetings as well as the commission&#x27;s external relations duties. The treaty further provides that the most recent European elections should be &quot;&quot;taken into account&quot; when appointing the President of the European Commission, and although they are still proposed by the European Council; the European Parliament &quot;elects&quot; candidates to the office, rather than &quot;approves&quot;&quot; them as under the Treaty of Nice.

The Barroso Commission is, in reaction to Euroscepticism, said to have toned down enforcement to increase integration.

===Jean-Claude Juncker===

In 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker became President of the European Commission.

Juncker appointed his previous campaign director and head of the transition team, Martin Selmayr, as his chief of cabinet. During the Juncker presidency Selmayr has been described as &quot;the most powerful EU chief of staff ever.&quot;

===Ursula von der Leyen===

In 2019, Ursula von der Leyen was appointed as President of the European Commission. She submitted the guidelines of her policy to the European Parliament on 16 July 2019, following her confirmation. She had not been considered a likely candidate (in general, the elected candidate is determined, according to the results of the European election, as winner of the internal election into the dominant European party known as &quot;&quot;). While the European People&#x27;s Party had won the European Parliament election, they had performed worse than expected and therefore nominated von der Leyen instead of Manfred Weber, their original candidate. On 9 September, the Council of the European Union declared a list of candidate-commissioners, which are sent to Brussels by the governments of each member state and which had to be officially approved by the parliament.

In September 2024, Von der Leyen revealed her new team of European Commissioners, marking a shift to a &quot;leaner&quot; and more interconnected structure. The lineup featured six executive vice-presidents (EVPs) from France, Finland, Estonia, Italy, Romania, and Spain. These EVPs, including Teresa Ribera and Stéphane Séjourné, were tasked with overseeing various clusters of Commissioners and steering key policy areas such as prosperity, security, and democracy. Raffaele Fitto was appointed despite criticism from European socialists over his hard-right affiliations. Other notable appointments included Kaja Kallas as EVP for Foreign and Security Policy, and Henna Virkkunen as EVP for Tech Sovereignty and Digital Technologies. The Commission also introduced new roles like the Commissioner for Defence and Security and the Commissioner for the Mediterranean.

==Powers and functions==
The commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments; it has been described as &quot;the only body paid to think European&quot;. The members are proposed by their member state governments, one from each. However, they are bound to act independently – free from other influences such as those governments which appointed them. This is in contrast to the Council of the European Union, which represents governments, the European Parliament, which represents citizens, the Economic and Social Committee, which represents organised civil society, and the Committee of the Regions, which represents local and regional authorities.

Through the commission has several responsibilities: to develop medium-term strategies; to draft legislation and arbitrate in the legislative process; to represent the EU in trade negotiations; to make rules and regulations, for example in competition policy; to draw up the budget of the European Union; and to scrutinise the implementation of the treaties and legislation. The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission&#x27;s operation and organisation.

===Executive power===
Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the executive power of the EU was held by the council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just by virtue of the treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to the commission&#x27;s lack of power over areas like foreign policy – that power is held by the Council of the European Union and the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.

Considering that under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Council has become a formal institution with the power of appointing the commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the EU (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission that currently holds most of the executive power over the European Union.

===Legislative initiative===
The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields, the Council and Parliament can request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates on the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is not binding.

The commission&#x27;s powers in proposing law have usually centred on economic regulation. It has put forward a large number of regulations based on a &quot;precautionary principle&quot;. This means that pre-emptive regulation takes place if there is a credible hazard to the environment or human health: for example on tackling climate change and restricting genetically modified organisms. The European Commission has committed EU member states to carbon neutrality by 2050. This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries. Owing to the size of the European market, this has made EU legislation an important influence in the global market. On February 23, 2022, the European Commission published the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive which establishes a framework of due diligence for companies to identify actual or potential risks and harm to human rights and the environment as well as establishing processes and standards to diminish these risks. The Directive is expected to be officially adopted in 2024 and then be incorporated into domestic laws within two years by all of the European Union member states.

Recently the commission has moved into creating European criminal law. In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. at that time did not even have a crime against shipping toxic waste; this led the Commissioners Franco Frattini and Stavros Dimas to put forward the idea of &quot;ecological crimes&quot;. Their right to propose criminal law was challenged in the European Court of Justice but upheld. the only other criminal law proposals which have been brought forward are on the intellectual property rights directive, and on an amendment to the 2002 counter-terrorism framework decision, outlawing terrorism‑related incitement, recruitment (especially via the internet) and training.

===Enforcement===
Once legislation is passed by the Council and Parliament, it is the commission&#x27;s responsibility to ensure it is implemented. It does this through the member states or through its agencies. In adopting the necessary technical measures, the commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states and of the public and private lobbies (a process known in jargon as &quot;comitology&quot;). Furthermore, the commission is responsible for the implementation of the EU budget, ensuring, along with the Court of Auditors, that EU funds are correctly spent.

In particular the commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld, potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the Court of Justice in a dispute. In this role it is known informally as the &quot;Guardian of the Treaties&quot;. Finally, the Commission provides some external representation for the Union, alongside the member states and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, representing the Union in bodies such as the World Trade Organization. It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the G7.

==College of Commissioners ==

The commission is composed of a &quot;College of Commissioners&quot; of members, including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is nominated on the basis of the suggestions made by the national governments, one per state, they do not represent their state in the commission. In practice, however, they do occasionally press for their national interest. Once proposed, the President delegates portfolios among each of the members. The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio, and can vary over time. For example, the Education Commissioner has been growing in importance, in line with the rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy-making. Another example is the Competition Commissioner, who holds a highly visible position with global reach. Before the commission can assume office, the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament. Commissioners are supported by their personal cabinet who give them political guidance, while the Civil Service (the DGs, see below) deal with technical preparation.

===Appointment===

The President of the Commission is first proposed by the European Council, following a Qualified Majority Vote (QMV), taking into account the latest parliamentary elections (any person from the largest party can be picked); that candidate then faces a formal election in the European Parliament. Thus this serves as a form of indirect election. If the European Parliament fails to elect the candidate, the European Council shall propose another within one month.

Following the selection of the President, and the appointment of the High Representative by the European Council, each Commissioner is proposed by their member state (except for those states who provided the President and High Representative) in consultation with the Commission President and the Council of the European Union, who formally adopts the list of candidates. The President&#x27;s proposed College of Commissioners is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If the European Parliament submits a negative opinion of a candidate, the President must either reshuffle them or request a new candidate from the member state to avoid the college&#x27;s outright rejection by the European Parliament. Once the college is approved by parliament, it is formally appointed following a QMV vote by the European Council.

Following the college&#x27;s appointment, the President appoints a number of Vice-presidents from among the commissioners. Vice-presidents manage policy areas involving multiple Commissioners. One of these includes the High Representative, who is automatically one of the Vice-presidents &quot;ex officio&quot; rather than by appointment and confirmation. Commonly referred to as the &#x27;HR/VP&#x27; position, the High Representative also coordinates commissioners&#x27; activities involving the external relations and defence cooperation of the European Union. The von der Leyen Commission also created the position of more senior Executive Vice-presidents, appointed from the three largest political groups in the European Parliament. Unlike the other vice-presidents, their mission is to manage the incumbent Commission&#x27;s top priority policy areas, for which they receive additional support from a dedicated Directorate-General.

===Dismissal===
The European Parliament can dissolve the College of Commissioners as a whole following a vote of no-confidence, which requires a two-thirds vote.

Only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

===Political styles===
The Barroso Commission took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college, which earned him some criticism.

However, under Barroso, the commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased with the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission.

==Administration==
The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. Each covers a specific policy area such as agriculture or justice and citizens&#x27; rights or internal services such as human resources and translation and is headed by a director-general who is responsible to a commissioner. A commissioner&#x27;s portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs; they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of commissioners proposals go forward to the Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission&#x27;s civil service is headed by a Secretary General. The position is currently held by Ilze Juhansone. The rules of procedure of the European Commission set out the commission&#x27;s operation and organisation.

There has been criticism from a number of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.

According to figures published by the commission, 23,803 persons were employed by the commission as officials and temporary agents in September 2012. In addition to these, 9230 &quot;external staff&quot; (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts, trainees etc.) were employed. The single largest DG is the Directorate-General for Translation, with a 2309-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is Belgian (18.7%), probably due to a majority (17,664) of staff being based in the country.

===Press===
Communication with the press is handled by the Directorate-General Communication. The commission&#x27;s chief spokesperson is Eric Mamer who holds the midday press briefings, commonly known as the &quot;Midday Presser&quot;. It takes place every weekday in the commission&#x27;s press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions to the Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an &quot;on the record&quot; answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.

As an integral part of the Directorate-General for Communication, the Spokesperson&#x27;s Service, in coordination with the Executive Communication Adviser in the President&#x27;s Cabinet, supports the President and Commissioners so that they can communicate effectively. On political communication matters, the chief spokesperson reports directly to the President of the European Commission.

It has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the commission are uniquely political. A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the commission and is used &quot;for justifying the EU and the Commission&quot; increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves. This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases, and is seen as a unique product of the EU&#x27;s political set-up.

There is a larger press corps in Brussels than Washington, D.C.; in 2020, media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels correspondent. Although there has been a worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. The Commission shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013, though the decision was criticised.

==Legitimacy and criticism==

As the commission is the executive branch, candidates are chosen individually by the national governments. Within the EU, the legitimacy of the commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with its power to dismiss the body. Eurosceptics have therefore raised the concern of the relatively low turnout (often less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, the fact that there are no direct elections for the position of Commission President calls the position&#x27;s legitimacy into question in the eyes of some Eurosceptics. The fact that the commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed &#x27;comitology committees&#x27;) on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.

Even though democratic structures and methods are changing there is not such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the perceived deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. Historically, the commission had indeed been seen as a technocratic expert body which, akin with institutions such as independent central banks, deals with technical areas of policy and therefore ought to be removed from party politics. From this viewpoint, electoral pressures would undermine the commission&#x27;s role as an independent regulator. Defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in most areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.

In 2009 the European ombudsman published statistics of citizens&#x27; complaints against EU institutions, with most of them filed against the commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%). In 2010 the commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the commission was highlighted in a number of reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.
In September 2020, the European Commission put forward an Anti-Racism Action Plan to tackle the structural racism in the European Union, including measures to address the lack of racial diversity among the European decision makers in Brussels, as denounced by the #BrusselsSoWhite movement.

==Initiatives==

===Anti-terrorism===
The European Commission has an Action Plan to enhance preparedness against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) security risks as part of its anti-terrorism package released in October 2017. In recent times Europe has seen an increased threat level of CBRN attacks. As such, the European Commission&#x27;s preparedness plan is important, said Steven Neville Chatfield, a director for the Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response in the United Kingdom&#x27;s Health Protection Agency. For the first time, the European Commission proposed that medical preparedness for CBRN attack threats is a high priority. &quot;The European Commission&#x27;s (EC) Action Plan to enhance preparedness against CBRN security risks is part of its anti-terrorism package released in October 2017, a strategy aimed at better protecting the more than 511 million citizens across the 27 member states of the European Union (EU).&quot;

===COVID-19 response===
The European Commission organized a video conference of world leaders on 4 May 2020 to raise funds for COVID-19 vaccine development. US$8 billion was raised.

The European Commission issued a new multi-year data plan in February 2020 pushing the digitalization of all aspects of EU society for the benefit of civic and economic growth.

The goal of this data strategy is to create a single market for data in which data flows across the EU and across sectors while maintaining full respect for privacy and data protection, where access rules are fair, and where the European economy benefits enormously as a global player as a result of the new data economy.

==Location==
The commission&#x27;s political seat is in Brussels with the President&#x27;s office and the commission&#x27;s meeting room on the 13th floor of the Berlaymont building. The commission also operates out of numerous other buildings in Brussels and Luxembourg City. When the Parliament is meeting in Strasbourg, the Commissioners also meet there in the Winston Churchill building to attend the Parliament&#x27;s debates. The Members of the Commission and their &quot;cabinets&quot; (immediate teams) are also based in the Berlaymont building in Brussels. Additionally, the European Commission has in-house scientific facilities that support it in: Ispra, Italy; Petten, Netherlands; Karlsruhe, Germany; Geel, Belgium and Seville, Spain. In Grange, County Meath, Ireland, a Commission site is hosting part of DG Santè.

<doc id="9975" wikidata="Q2619517" url="?curid=9975" title="Linear filter">
<text>Linear filters process time-varying input signals to produce output signals, subject to the constraint of linearity. In most cases these linear filters are also time invariant (or shift invariant) in which case they can be analyzed exactly using LTI (&quot;linear time-invariant&quot;) system theory revealing their transfer functions in the frequency domain and their impulse responses in the time domain. Real-time implementations of such linear signal processing filters in the time domain are inevitably causal, an additional constraint on their transfer functions. An analog electronic circuit consisting only of linear components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, and linear amplifiers) will necessarily fall in this category, as will comparable mechanical systems or digital signal processing systems containing only linear elements. Since linear time-invariant filters can be completely characterized by their response to sinusoids of different frequencies (their frequency response), they are sometimes known as frequency filters.

Non real-time implementations of linear time-invariant filters need not be causal. Filters of more than one dimension are also used such as in image processing. The general concept of linear filtering also extends into other fields and technologies such as statistics, data analysis, and mechanical engineering.

== Impulse response and transfer function ==
A linear time-invariant (LTI) filter can be uniquely specified by its impulse response &quot;h&quot;, and the output of any filter is mathematically expressed as the convolution of the input with that impulse response. The frequency response, given by the filter&#x27;s transfer function formula_1, is an alternative characterization of the filter. Typical filter design goals are to realize a particular frequency response, that is, the magnitude of the transfer function formula_2; the importance of the phase of the transfer function varies according to the application, inasmuch as the shape of a waveform can be distorted to a greater or lesser extent in the process of achieving a desired (amplitude) response in the frequency domain. The frequency response may be tailored to, for instance, eliminate unwanted frequency components from an input signal, or to limit an amplifier to signals within a particular band of frequencies.

The impulse response &quot;h&quot; of a linear time-invariant causal filter specifies the output that the filter would produce if it were to receive an input consisting of a single impulse at time 0. An &quot;impulse&quot; in a continuous time filter means a Dirac delta function; in a discrete time filter the Kronecker delta function would apply. The impulse response completely characterizes the response of any such filter, inasmuch as any possible input signal can be expressed as a (possibly infinite) combination of weighted delta functions. Multiplying the impulse response shifted in time according to the arrival of each of these delta functions by the amplitude of each delta function, and summing these responses together (according to the superposition principle, applicable to all linear systems) yields the output waveform.

Mathematically this is described as the convolution of a time-varying input signal &quot;x(t)&quot; with the filter&#x27;s impulse response &quot;h&quot;, defined as:

:formula_3 or
:formula_4.

The first form is the continuous-time form, which describes mechanical and analog electronic systems, for instance. The second equation is a discrete-time version used, for example, by digital filters implemented in software, so-called &quot;digital signal processing&quot;. The impulse response &quot;h&quot; completely characterizes any linear time-invariant (or shift-invariant in the discrete-time case) filter. The input &quot;x&quot; is said to be &quot;convolved&quot; with the impulse response &quot;h&quot; having a (possibly infinite) duration of time &quot;T&quot; (or of &quot;N&quot; sampling periods).

Filter design consists of finding a possible transfer function that can be implemented within certain practical constraints dictated by the technology or desired complexity of the system, followed by a practical design that realizes that transfer function using the chosen technology. The complexity of a filter may be specified according to the order of the filter.

Among the time-domain filters we here consider, there are two general classes of filter transfer functions that can approximate a desired frequency response. Very different mathematical treatments apply to the design of filters termed infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, characteristic of mechanical and analog electronics systems, and finite impulse response (FIR) filters, which can be implemented by discrete time systems such as computers (then termed &quot;digital signal processing&quot;).

Classical analog filters are IIR filters, and classical filter theory centers on the determination of transfer functions given by low order rational functions, which can be synthesized using the same small number of reactive components. Using digital computers, on the other hand, both FIR and IIR filters are straightforward to implement in software.

A digital IIR filter can generally approximate a desired filter response using less computing power than a FIR filter, however this advantage is more often unneeded given the increasing power of digital processors. The ease of designing and characterizing FIR filters makes them preferable to the filter designer (programmer) when ample computing power is available. Another advantage of FIR filters is that their impulse response can be made symmetric, which implies a response in the frequency domain that has zero phase at all frequencies (not considering a finite delay), which is absolutely impossible with any IIR filter.

== Frequency response ==

The frequency response or transfer function formula_2 of a filter can be obtained if the impulse response is known, or directly through analysis using Laplace transforms, or in discrete-time systems the Z-transform. The frequency response also includes the phase as a function of frequency, however in many cases the phase response is of little or no interest. FIR filters can be made to have zero phase, but with IIR filters that is generally impossible. With most IIR transfer functions there are related transfer functions having a frequency response with the same magnitude but a different phase; in most cases the so-called minimum phase transfer function is preferred.

Filters in the time domain are most often requested to follow a specified frequency response. Then, a mathematical procedure finds a filter transfer function that can be realized (within some constraints), and approximates the desired response to within some criterion. Common filter response specifications are described as follows:

*A low-pass filter passes low frequencies while blocking higher frequencies.
*A high-pass filter passes high frequencies.
*A band-pass filter passes a band (range) of frequencies.
*A band-stop filter passes high and low frequencies outside of a specified band.
*A notch filter has a null response at a particular frequency. This function may be combined with one of the above responses.
*An all-pass filter passes all frequencies equally well, but alters the group delay and phase relationship among them.
*An equalization filter is not designed to fully pass or block any frequency, but instead to gradually vary the amplitude response as a function of frequency: filters used as pre-emphasis filters, equalizers, or tone controls are good examples.

===FIR transfer functions===

Meeting a frequency response requirement with an FIR filter uses relatively straightforward procedures. In the most basic form, the desired frequency response itself can be sampled with a resolution of formula_6 and Fourier transformed to the time domain. This obtains the filter coefficients &quot;hi&quot;, which implements a zero phase FIR filter that matches the frequency response at the sampled frequencies used. To better match a desired response, formula_6 must be reduced. However the duration of the filter&#x27;s impulse response, and the number of terms that must be summed for each output value (according to the above discrete time convolution) is given by formula_8 where &quot;T&quot; is the sampling period of the discrete time system (N-1 is also termed the &quot;order&quot; of an FIR filter). Thus the complexity of a digital filter and the computing time involved, grows inversely with formula_6, placing a higher cost on filter functions that better approximate the desired behavior. For the same reason, filter functions whose critical response is at lower frequencies (compared to the sampling frequency &quot;1/T&quot;) require a higher order, more computationally intensive FIR filter. An IIR filter can thus be much more efficient in such cases.

Elsewhere the reader may find further discussion of design methods for practical FIR filter design.

===IIR transfer functions===

Since classical analog filters are IIR filters, there has been a long history of studying the range of possible transfer functions implementing various of the above desired filter responses in continuous time systems. Using transforms it is possible to convert these continuous time frequency responses to ones that are implemented in discrete time, for use in digital IIR filters. The complexity of any such filter is given by the &quot;order&quot; N, which describes the order of the rational function describing the frequency response. The order N is of particular importance in analog filters, because an Nth order electronic filter requires N reactive elements (capacitors and/or inductors) to implement. If a filter is implemented using, for instance, biquad stages using op-amps, N/2 stages are needed. In a digital implementation, the number of computations performed per sample is proportional to N. Thus the mathematical problem is to obtain the best approximation (in some sense) to the desired response using a smaller N, as we shall now illustrate.

Below are the frequency responses of several standard filter functions that approximate a desired response, optimized according to some criterion. These are all fifth-order low-pass filters, designed for a cutoff frequency of .5 in normalized units. Frequency responses are shown for the Butterworth, Chebyshev, inverse Chebyshev, and elliptic filters.

As is clear from the image, the elliptic filter is sharper than the others, but at the expense of ripples in both its passband and stopband. The Butterworth filter has the poorest transition but has a more even response, avoiding ripples in either the passband or stopband. A Bessel filter (not shown) has an even poorer transition in the frequency domain, but maintains the best phase fidelity of a waveform. Different applications emphasize different design requirements, leading to different choices among these (and other) optimizations, or requiring a filter of a higher order.

==Example implementations==

A popular circuit implementing a second order active R-C filter is the Sallen-Key design, whose schematic diagram is shown here. This topology can be adapted to produce low-pass, band-pass, and high pass filters.

An Nth order FIR filter can be implemented in a discrete time system using a computer program or specialized hardware in which the input signal is subject to N delay stages. The output of the filter is formed as the weighted sum of those delayed signals, as is depicted in the accompanying signal flow diagram. The response of the filter depends on the weighting coefficients denoted &quot;b0&quot;, &quot;b1&quot;, ... &quot;bN&quot;. For instance, if all of the coefficients were equal to unity, a so-called boxcar function, then it would implement a low-pass filter with a low frequency gain of N+1 and a frequency response given by the sinc function. Superior shapes for the frequency response can be obtained using coefficients derived from a more sophisticated design procedure.

== Mathematics of filter design ==
LTI system theory describes linear &quot;time-invariant&quot; (LTI) filters of all types. LTI filters can be completely described by their frequency response and phase response, the specification of which uniquely defines their impulse response, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. From a mathematical viewpoint, continuous-time IIR LTI filters may be described in terms of linear differential equations, and their impulse responses considered as Green&#x27;s functions of the equation. Continuous-time LTI filters may also be described in terms of the Laplace transform of their impulse response, which allows all of the characteristics of the filter to be analyzed by considering the pattern of zeros and poles of their Laplace transform in the complex plane. Similarly, discrete-time LTI filters may be analyzed via the Z-transform of their impulse response.

Before the advent of computer filter synthesis tools, graphical tools such as Bode plots and Nyquist plots were extensively used as design tools. Even today, they are invaluable tools to understanding filter behavior. Reference books had extensive plots of frequency response, phase response, group delay, and impulse response for various types of filters, of various orders. They also contained tables of values showing how to implement such filters as RLC ladders - very useful when amplifying elements were expensive compared to passive components. Such a ladder can also be designed to have minimal sensitivity to component variation a property hard to evaluate without computer tools.

Many different analog filter designs have been developed, each trying to optimise some feature of the system response. For practical filters, a custom design is sometimes desirable, that can offer the best tradeoff between different design criteria, which may include component count and cost, as well as filter response characteristics.

These descriptions refer to the &quot;mathematical&quot; properties of the filter (that is, the frequency and phase response). These can be &quot;implemented&quot; as analog circuits (for instance, using a Sallen Key filter topology, a type of active filter), or as algorithms in digital signal processing systems.

Digital filters are much more flexible to synthesize and use than analog filters, where the constraints of the design permits their use. Notably, there is no need to consider component tolerances, and very high Q levels may be obtained.

FIR digital filters may be implemented by the direct convolution of the desired impulse response with the input signal.
They can easily be designed to give a matched filter for any arbitrary pulse shape.

IIR digital filters are often more difficult to design, due to problems including dynamic range issues, quantization noise and instability.
Typically digital IIR filters are designed as a series of digital biquad filters.

All low-pass second-order continuous-time filters have a transfer function given by

All band-pass second-order continuous-time filters have a transfer function given by

* &quot;Q&quot; is the Q factor
* formula_12 is the center frequency
* formula_13 is the complex frequency

<text>In grammar, the ergative case (abbreviated ) is the grammatical case that identifies a nominal phrase as the agent of a transitive verb in ergative–absolutive languages.

==Characteristics==
In such languages, the ergative case is typically marked (most salient), while the absolutive case is unmarked. Recent work in case theory has vigorously supported the idea that the ergative case identifies the agent (the intentful performer of an action) of a verb.

In Kalaallisut (Greenlandic) for example, the ergative case is used to mark subjects of transitive verbs and possessors of nouns. This syncretism with the genitive is commonly referred to as the &quot;relative&quot; case.

Nez Perce has a three-way nominal case system with both ergative (&quot;-nim&quot;) and accusative (&quot;-ne&quot;) plus an absolute (unmarked) case for intransitive subjects: &quot;hipáayna qíiwn&quot; ‘the old man arrived’; &quot;hipáayna wewúkiye&quot; ‘the elk arrived’; &quot;wewúkiyene péexne qíiwnim&quot; ‘the old man saw an elk’.

Sahaptin has an ergative noun case (with suffix &quot;-nɨm&quot;) that is limited to transitive constructions only when the direct object is 1st or 2nd person: &quot;iwapáatayaaš łmámanɨm&quot; ‘the old woman helped me’; &quot;paanáy iwapáataya łmáma&quot; ‘the old woman helped him/her’ (direct); &quot;páwapaataya łmámayin&quot; ‘the old woman helped him/her’ (inverse).

In languages with an optional ergative, the choice between marking the ergative case or not depends on semantic or pragmatics aspects such as marking focus on the argument.

Other languages that use the ergative case are Georgian, Chechen, and other Caucasian languages, Mayan languages, Mixe–Zoque languages, Wagiman and other Australian Aboriginal languages as well as Basque, Burushaski and Tibetan. Among all Indo-European languages, only Yaghnobi, Kurdish language varieties (including Kurmanji, Zazaki and Sorani) and Pashto from the Iranian languages and Hindi/Urdu, along with some other Indo-Aryan languages, are ergative.

The ergative case is also a feature of some constructed languages such as Na&#x27;vi, Ithkuil and Black Speech.

<doc id="9978" wikidata="Q189204" url="?curid=9978" title="Essenes">
<text>The Essenes (; Hebrew: , &quot;ʾĪssīyīm&quot;; Greek: Ἐσσηνοί, Ἐσσαῖοι, or Ὀσσαῖοι, &quot;Essenoi, Essaioi, Ossaioi&quot;) or Essenians were a mystic Jewish sect during the Second Temple period that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE.

The Essene movement likely originated as a distinct group among Jews during Jonathan Apphus&#x27; time, driven by disputes over Jewish law and the belief that Jonathan&#x27;s high priesthood was illegitimate. Most scholars think the Essenes seceded from the Zadokite priests. They attributed their interpretation of the Torah to their early leader, the Teacher of Righteousness, possibly a legitimate high priest. Embracing a conservative approach to Jewish law, they observed a strict hierarchy favoring priests (the Sons of Zadok) over laypeople, emphasized ritual purity, and held a dualistic worldview.

According to Jewish writers Josephus and Philo, the Essenes numbered around four thousand, and resided in various settlements throughout Judaea. Conversely, Roman writer Pliny the Elder positioned them somewhere above Ein Gedi, on the west side of the Dead Sea. Pliny relates in a few lines that the Essenes possess no money, had existed for thousands of generations, and that their priestly class (&quot;contemplatives&quot;) did not marry. Josephus gave a detailed account of the Essenes in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (), with a shorter description in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; () and &quot;The Life of Flavius Josephus&quot; (). Claiming firsthand knowledge, he lists the &quot;Essenoi&quot; as one of the three sects of Jewish philosophy alongside the Pharisees and Sadducees. He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy; the absence of personal property and of money; the belief in communality; and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every morning (a practice similar to the use of the mikveh for daily immersion found among some contemporary Hasidim), ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings.

The Essenes have gained fame in modern times as a result of the discovery of an extensive group of religious documents known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are commonly believed to be the Essenes&#x27; library. The scrolls were found at Qumran, an archaeological site situated along the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, believed to have been the dwelling place of an Essene community. These documents preserve multiple copies of parts of the Hebrew Bible along with deuterocanonical and sectarian manuscripts, including writings such as the Community Rule, the Damascus Document, and the War Scroll, which provide valuable insights into the communal life, ideology and theology of the Essenes.

According to the conventional view, the Essenes disappeared after the First Jewish–Roman War, which also witnessed the destruction of the settlement at Qumran. Scholars have noted the absence of direct sources supporting this claim, raising the possibility of their endurance or the survival of related groups in the following centuries. Some researchers suggest that Essene teachings could have influenced other religious traditions, such as Mandaeism, Jewish Christianity, and small group of Assyrians.

== Etymology ==
Josephus uses the name &quot;Essenes&quot; in his two main accounts, &quot;The Jewish War&quot; 2.119, 158, 160 and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, 13.171–2, but some manuscripts read here &quot;Essaion&quot; (&quot;holding the Essenes in honour&quot;; &quot;a certain Essene named Manaemus&quot;; &quot;to hold all Essenes in honor&quot;; &quot;the Essenes&quot;).

In several places, however, Josephus has &quot;Essaios&quot;, which is usually assumed to mean &quot;Essene&quot; (&quot;Judas of the &quot;Essaios&quot; race&quot;; &quot;Simon of the &quot;Essaios&quot; race&quot;; &quot;John the &quot;Essaios&quot;&quot;; &quot;those who are called by us &quot;Essaioi&quot;&quot;; &quot;Simon a man of the &quot;Essaios&quot; race&quot;). Josephus identified the Essenes as one of the three major Jewish sects of that period.

Philo&#x27;s usage is &quot;Essaioi&quot;, although he admits this Greek form of the original name, that according to his etymology signifies &quot;holiness&quot;, to be inexact. Pliny&#x27;s Latin text has &quot;Esseni&quot;.

Gabriele Boccaccini implies that a convincing etymology for the name Essene has not been found, but that the term applies to a larger group within Judea that also included the Qumran community.

It was proposed before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered that the name came into several Greek spellings from a Hebrew self-designation later found in some Dead Sea Scrolls, &quot;ʻosey haTorah&quot;, &quot;&#x27;doers&#x27; or &#x27;makers&#x27; of Torah&quot;. Although dozens of etymology suggestions have been published, this is the only etymology published before 1947 that was confirmed by Qumran text self-designation references, and it is gaining acceptance among scholars. It is recognized as the etymology of the form &quot;Ossaioi&quot; (and note that Philo also offered an O spelling) and &quot;Essaioi&quot; and &quot;Esseni&quot; spelling variations have been discussed by VanderKam, Goranson, and others. In medieval Hebrew (e.g., &quot;Sefer Yosippon&quot;) &quot;Hassidim&quot; &quot;the Pious&quot; replaces &quot;Essenes&quot;. While this Hebrew name is not the etymology of &quot;Essaioi&quot;/&quot;Esseni&quot;, the Aramaic equivalent &quot;Hesi&#x27;im&quot; known from Eastern Aramaic texts has been suggested. Others suggest that Essene is a transliteration of the Hebrew word &quot;ḥiṣonim&quot; (&quot;ḥiṣon&quot; &quot;outside&quot;), which the Mishnah (e.g., Megillah 4:8) uses to describe various sectarian groups. Another theory is that the name was borrowed from a cult of devotees to Artemis in Anatolia, whose demeanor and dress somewhat resembled those of the group in Judea.

Flavius Josephus in Chapter 8 of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; states:

==Location==

According to Josephus, the Essenes had settled &quot;not in one city&quot; but &quot;in large numbers in every town&quot;. Philo speaks of &quot;more than four thousand&quot; &quot;Essaioi&quot; living in &quot;Palestine and Syria&quot;, more precisely, &quot;in many cities of Judaea and in many villages and grouped in great societies of many members&quot;.

Pliny locates them &quot;on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda&quot;.

Some modern scholars and archeologists have argued that Essenes inhabited the settlement at Qumran, a plateau in the Judean Desert along the Dead Sea, citing Pliny the Elder in support and giving credence that the Dead Sea Scrolls are the product of the Essenes. This theory, though not yet conclusively proven, has come to dominate the scholarly discussion and public perception of the Essenes.

==Rules, customs, theology, and beliefs==
The accounts by Josephus and Philo show that the Essenes led a strictly communal life—often compared to later Christian monasticism. Many of the Essene groups appear to have been celibate, but Josephus speaks also of another &quot;&quot;order&quot; of Essenes&quot; that observed the practice of being engaged for three years and then becoming married. According to Josephus, they had customs and observances such as collective ownership, electing a leader to attend to the interests of the group, and obedience to the orders from their leader. Also, they were forbidden from swearing oaths and from sacrificing animals. They controlled their tempers and served as channels of peace, carrying weapons only for protection against robbers. The Essenes chose not to possess slaves but served each other and, as a result of communal ownership, did not engage in trading. Josephus and Philo provide lengthy accounts of their communal meetings, meals, and religious celebrations. This communal living has led some scholars to view the Essenes as a group practicing social and material egalitarianism.

Despite their prohibition on swearing oaths, after a three-year probationary period, new members would take an oath that included a commitment to practice piety to God and righteousness toward humanity; maintain a pure lifestyle; abstain from criminal and immoral activities; transmit their rules uncorrupted; and preserve the books of the Essenes and the names of the angels. Their theology included belief in the immortality of the soul and that they would receive their souls back after death. Part of their activities included purification by water rituals which was supported by rainwater catchment and storage. According to the Community Rule, repentance was a prerequisite to water purification.

Ritual purification was a common practice among the peoples of Judea during this period and was thus not specific to the Essenes. A ritual bath or mikveh was found near many synagogues of the period continuing into modern times. Purity and cleanliness was considered so important to the Essenes that they would refrain from defecation on the Sabbath.

According to Joseph Lightfoot, the Church Father Epiphanius (writing in the 4th century CE) seems to make a distinction between two main groups within the Essenes: &quot;Of those that came before his [Elxai, an Ossaean prophet] time and during it, the Ossaeans and the Nasaraeans.&quot; Epiphanius describes each group as following:
We do not know much about the canon of the Essenes, and what their attitude was towards the apocryphal writings, however the Essenes perhaps did not esteem the book of Esther highly as manuscripts of Esther are completely absent in Qumran, likely because of their opposition to mixed marriages and the use of different calendars.

The Essenes were unique for their time for being against the practice of slave-ownership, and slavery, which they regarded as unjust and ungodly, regarding all men as having been born equal.

== Involvement in the First Jewish–Roman War ==
At the outset of the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE, as Roman advances were anticipated, command over parts of western Judea was assigned to John the Essene (or Essaean), who was placed in charge of the toparchy of Thamna. This region encompassed Lydda, Joppa, and Emmaus.

== Scholarly discussion ==

Josephus and Philo discuss the Essenes in detail. Most scholars believe that the community at Qumran that most likely produced the Dead Sea Scrolls was an offshoot of the Essenes. However, this theory has been disputed by some; for example, Norman Golb argues that the primary research on the Qumran documents and ruins (by Father Roland de Vaux, from the &quot;École Biblique et Archéologique de Jérusalem&quot;) lacked scientific method, and drew wrong conclusions that comfortably entered the academic canon. For Golb, the number of documents is too extensive and includes many different writing styles and calligraphies; the ruins seem to have been a fortress, used as a military base for a very long period of time—including the 1st century—so they therefore could not have been inhabited by the Essenes; and the large graveyard excavated in 1870, just east of the Qumran ruins, was made of over 1200 tombs that included many women and children; Pliny clearly wrote that the Essenes who lived near the Dead Sea &quot;had not one woman, had renounced all pleasure... and no one was born in their race&quot;. Golb&#x27;s book presents observations about de Vaux&#x27;s premature conclusions and their uncontroverted acceptance by the general academic community. He states that the documents probably stemmed from various libraries in Jerusalem, kept safe in the desert from the Roman invasions. Other scholars refute these arguments—particularly since Josephus describes some Essenes as allowing marriage.

Another issue is the relationship between the &quot;Essaioi&quot; and Philo&#x27;s &quot;Therapeutae&quot; and &quot;Therapeutrides&quot;. He regarded the &quot;Therapeutae&quot; as a contemplative branch of the &quot;Essaioi&quot; who, he said, pursued an active life.

One theory on the formation of the Essenes suggests that the movement was founded by a Jewish high priest, dubbed by the Essenes the Teacher of Righteousness, whose office had been usurped by Jonathan (of priestly but not of Zadokite lineage), labeled the &quot;man of lies&quot; or &quot;false priest&quot;. Others follow this line and a few argue that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also identical to the original Messianic figure about 150 years before the time of the Gospels. Fred Gladstone Bratton notes that
 Lawrence Schiffman has argued that the Qumran community may be called Sadducean, and not Essene, since their legal positions retain a link with Sadducean tradition.

== Connection to other religious traditions ==

=== Mandaeism ===
The Haran Gawaita uses the name Nasoraeans for the Mandaeans arriving from Jerusalem, meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. Scholars such as Kurt Rudolph, Rudolf Macúch, Mark Lidzbarski and Ethel S. Drower connect the Mandaeans with the Nasaraeans described by Epiphanius, a group within the Essenes according to Joseph Lightfoot. Epiphanius (29:6) says that they existed before Jesus. That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of the Nasaraeans.

Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and &quot;Yardena&quot; (Jordan) has been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism. &quot;Mara ḏ-Rabuta&quot; (Mandaic for &#x27;Lord of Greatness&#x27;, which is One of the names for the Mandaean God Hayyi Rabbi) is found in the Genesis Apocryphon II, 4. Another early self-appellation is &quot;bhiria zidqa&quot;, meaning &#x27;elect of righteousness&#x27; or &#x27;the chosen righteous&#x27;, a term found in the Book of Enoch and Genesis Apocryphon II, 4. As Nasoraeans, Mandaeans believe that they constitute the true congregation of &quot;bnia nhura&quot;, meaning &#x27;Sons of Light&#x27;, a term used by the Essenes. Mandaean scripture affirms that the Mandaeans descend directly from John the Baptist&#x27;s original Nasoraean Mandaean disciples in Jerusalem. Similar to the Essenes, it is forbidden for a Mandaean to reveal the names of the angels to a gentile. Essene graves are oriented north–south and a Mandaean&#x27;s grave must also be in the north–south direction so that if the dead Mandaean were stood upright, they would face north. Mandaeans have an oral tradition that some were originally vegetarian and also similar to the Essenes, they are pacifists.

The &quot;bit manda&quot; (beth manda) is described as &quot;biniana rba ḏ-šrara&quot; (&quot;the Great building of Truth&quot;) and &quot;bit tušlima&quot; (&quot;house of Perfection&quot;) in Mandaean texts such as the &quot;Qulasta&quot;, &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, and the &quot;Mandaean Book of John&quot;. The only known literary parallels are in Essene texts from Qumran such as the &quot;Community Rule&quot;, which has similar phrases such as the &quot;house of Perfection and Truth in Israel&quot; (&quot;Community Rule&quot; 1QS VIII 9) and &quot;house of Truth in Israel.&quot;

=== Christianity ===

Rituals of the Essenes and Christianity have much in common; the Dead Sea Scrolls describe a meal of bread and wine that will be instituted by the messiah, both the Essenes and Christians were eschatological communities, where judgement on the world would come at any time. The New Testament also possibly quotes writings used by the Qumran community. Luke 1:31-35 states &quot; And now you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the son of the Most High...the son of God&quot; which seems to echo 4Q 246, stating: &quot;&quot;He will be called great and he will be called Son of God, and they will call him Son of the Most High...He will judge the earth in righteousness...and every nation will bow down to him&quot;.&quot;

Other similarities include high devotion to the faith even to the point of martyrdom, communal prayer, self denial and a belief in a captivity in a sinful world.

John the Baptist has also been argued to have been an Essene, as there are numerous parallels between John&#x27;s mission and the Essenes, which suggests he perhaps was trained by the Essene community.

In the early church a book called the Odes of Solomon was written. The writer was likely a very early convert from the Essene community into Christianity. The book reflects a mixture of mystical ideas of the Essene community with Christian concepts.

Both the Essenes and Christians practiced voluntary celibacy and prohibited divorce. Both also used concepts of &quot;light&quot; and &quot;darkness&quot; for good and evil.

A few have claimed that the Essenes had an idea of a pierced Messiah based on 4Q285; however, the interpretation of the text is ambiguous. Some scholars interpreted it as the Messiah being killed himself, while modern scholars mostly interpret it as the Messiah executing the enemies of Israel in an eschatological war.

Both the Essenes and Christians practiced a ritual of immersion by water, however the Essenes had it as a regular practice instead of a one time event.

===Magarites===
The Magharians or Magarites (, &#x27;people of the caves&#x27;) were, according to Jacob Qirqisani, a Jewish sect founded in the 1st century BCE.
Abraham Harkavy and others identify the Magharians with the Essenes, and their author referred to as the &quot;Alexandrinian&quot; with Philo (whose affinity for the Essenes is well-known), based on the following evidence:
* The sect&#x27;s name, which, in his view, does not refer to its books but to its followers who lived in caves or desert areas—an established Essene lifestyle;
* The sect&#x27;s founding date coinciding with that of the Essenes;
* The theory that God interacts with humans through an angel aligning with Essene beliefs, as well as Philo&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Logos&quot;;
* Qirqisani&#x27;s omission of the Essenes from his list of Jewish sects, which can be explained if he considered the Magharians to be synonymous with the Essenes.

<text>Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 erotic mystery psychological drama film directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. It is based on the 1926 novella &quot;Dream Story&quot; () by Arthur Schnitzler, transferring the story&#x27;s setting from early twentieth-century Vienna to 1990s New York City. The plot centers on a doctor (Tom Cruise) who is shocked when his wife (Nicole Kidman) reveals that she had contemplated having an affair the previous summer. He then embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.

Kubrick obtained the filming rights for &quot;Dream Story&quot; in the 1960s, considering it a perfect text for a film adaptation about sexual relations. He revived the project in the 1990s when he hired writer Frederic Raphael to help him with the adaptation. The film, which was mostly shot in England, apart from some exterior establishing shots, includes a detailed recreation of exterior Greenwich Village street scenes made at Pinewood Studios. The film&#x27;s production, at 400 days, holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous film shoot.

Kubrick died of a heart attack six days after showing the final cut of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; to Warner Bros., making it the final film he directed. He reportedly considered it his &quot;greatest contribution to the art of cinema&quot;. In order to ensure a theatrical R rating in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several sexually explicit scenes during post-production. This version was premiered on July 13, 1999, before being released on July 16, to generally positive but polarized reviews from critics. Box office receipts for the film worldwide were about $162 million, making it Kubrick&#x27;s highest-grossing film. The uncut version has since been released in DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.

==Plot==
Dr. William &quot;Bill&quot; Harford and his wife Alice live in New York City with their daughter, Helena. At a Christmas party hosted by Bill&#x27;s patient, Victor Ziegler, Bill reconnects with his former medical school classmate, Nick Nightingale, now a professional pianist. Meanwhile, an older Hungarian guest attempts to seduce Alice, while two young models try to seduce Bill. Ziegler interrupts Bill&#x27;s flirtation to handle an emergency involving Mandy, a young woman who overdosed during sex with him. Bill helps stabilize Mandy.

The following night, Bill and Alice smoke marijuana and discuss their unfulfilled desires. Bill dismisses the idea of Alice being unfaithful, believing women to be naturally loyal. However, Alice shocks him by confessing to fantasizing about a naval officer she observed while on vacation, even considering leaving Bill and Helena for him. Disturbed, Bill is called to a patient&#x27;s home, where the patient’s daughter, Marion, confesses her love and tries to seduce him. Bill resists and leaves.

Wandering the city, Bill meets a prostitute named Domino. Before anything happens, Alice calls, prompting Bill to leave after paying Domino without proceeding further. Later, Bill encounters Nick at a jazz club. Nick describes a secret masked orgy at a mansion outside the city, where he will play piano blindfolded, and reveals the password to gain entry. Intrigued, Bill visits a costume store, formerly owned by one of his patients but now run by Mr. Milich, to rent an outfit. During the visit, Milich discovers his teenage daughter with two older men and locks them in a room, threatening to call the police.

Bill arrives at the mansion, provides the password, and witnesses a bizarre sexual ritual. A masked woman warns him that he is in danger. When the master of ceremonies demands a second password, Bill is exposed as an outsider. The masked woman intervenes, offering herself to save him. Bill is let go with a stern warning to remain silent.

Shaken, Bill returns home to find Alice laughing in her sleep. She tearfully recounts a dream of having sex with the naval officer and many other men while mocking Bill. The next day, Bill visits Nick’s hotel, but the clerk claims Nick was taken away by two threatening men. Returning the costume, Bill notices the mask is missing and learns that Milich now profits from prostituting his daughter, offering her services to Bill.

Consumed by jealousy and doubt, Bill revisits the mansion but receives an envelope warning him to stay away. That evening, he tries calling Marion but hangs up when her fiancé answers. He then visits Domino&#x27;s apartment, only to find her roommate, Sally, who informs him that Domino has tested HIV-positive.

As Bill leaves, a mysterious figure follows him. Later, at the morgue, he identifies Mandy as the masked woman from the orgy after reading about her death from an overdose. Ziegler summons Bill and admits to being at the orgy. He explains that there was no second password and that Bill’s exposure was deliberate. Ziegler insists the secret society only seeks to intimidate him into silence but warns they are dangerous. He claims Nick has returned safely to Seattle and attributes Mandy&#x27;s death to her drug addiction, dismissing foul play.

Returning home, Bill finds the missing mask placed on his pillow. Overcome with guilt, he confesses everything to Alice. The next day, the couple takes Helena Christmas shopping. Bill apologizes to Alice, who suggests they take action to repair their relationship. When he asks what she means, Alice responds with a single word: &quot;Fuck.&quot;

===Development===
&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was developed after Stanley Kubrick read Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Dream Story&quot; in 1968, when Kubrick was looking for a project to follow &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Kubrick was interested in adapting the story, and with the help of journalist Jay Cocks, bought the filming rights to the novel. For the following decade, Kubrick considered making the &quot;Dream Story&quot; adaptation a sex comedy &quot;with a wild and somber streak running through it&quot;, starring Steve Martin or Woody Allen in the main role. Kubrick also considered Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Albert Brooks, Alan Alda and Sam Shepard for the lead in the 1980s. The project was revived in 1994 when Kubrick hired Frederic Raphael to work on the script, updating the setting from early 20th-century Vienna to late 20th-century New York City. Kubrick invited his friend Michael Herr, who helped write &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, to make revisions, but Herr declined for fear he would be underpaid and have to commit to a long production.

===Adaptation===
Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s 1926 novella &quot;Dream Story&quot; is set around Vienna after the turn of the century. The main characters are a couple named Fridolin and Albertina. The couple&#x27;s home is a typical suburban middle-class home. Like the protagonist of the novel, Schnitzler was Jewish, lived in Vienna, and was a doctor, although he left medicine to write.

Kubrick frequently removed references to the Jewishness of characters in the novels he adapted. In &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, Frederic Raphael, who is Jewish, wanted to keep the Jewish background of the protagonists, but Kubrick disagreed and removed details that would identify characters as Jewish. Kubrick determined Bill should be a &quot;Harrison Ford-ish goy&quot; and created the surname of Harford as an allusion to the actor. In the film, Bill is taunted with homophobic slurs. In the novella, the taunters are members of an anti-Semitic college fraternity. In an introduction to a Penguin Classics edition of &quot;Dream Story&quot;, Raphael wrote that &quot;Fridolin is not declared to be a Jew, but his feelings of cowardice, for failing to challenge his aggressor, echo the uneasiness of Austrian Jews in the face of Gentile provocation.&quot;

The novella is set during the Carnival, when people often wear masks to parties. The party that both husband and wife attend at the opening of the story is a Carnival Masquerade ball, whereas the film&#x27;s story begins at Christmas time.

In the novella, the party (which is sparsely attended) uses &quot;Denmark&quot; as the password for entrance; that is significant in that Albertina had her infatuation with her soldier in Denmark; the film&#x27;s password is &quot;Fidelio&quot;. In early drafts of the screenplay, the password was &quot;Fidelio Rainbow&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum noted that both passwords echo elements of one member of the couple&#x27;s behavior, though in opposite ways. The party in the novella consists mostly of nude ballroom dancing.

In the novella, the woman who &quot;redeems&quot; Fridolin at the party, saving him from punishment, is costumed as a nun, and most of the characters at the party are dressed as nuns or monks; Fridolin himself used a monk costume. This aspect was retained in the film&#x27;s original screenplay, but was deleted in the filmed version.

The novella makes it clear that Fridolin at this point hates Albertina more than ever, thinking they are now lying together &quot;like mortal enemies&quot;. It has been argued that the dramatic climax of the novella is actually Albertina&#x27;s dream, and the film has shifted the focus to Bill&#x27;s visit to the secret society&#x27;s orgy, whose content is more shocking in the film.

The adaptation created a character with no counterpart in the novella: Ziegler, who represents both the high wealth and prestige to which Bill Harford aspires, and a connection between Bill&#x27;s two worlds (his regular life, and the secret society organizing the ball). Critic Randy Rasmussen interprets Ziegler as representing Bill&#x27;s worst self, much as in other Kubrick films; the title character in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; represents the worst of the American national security establishment, Charles Grady represents the worst of Jack Torrance in &quot;The Shining&quot;, and Clare Quilty represents the worst of Humbert Humbert in &quot;Lolita&quot;.

More significantly, in the film, Ziegler gives a commentary on the whole story to Bill, including an explanation that the party incident, where Bill is apprehended, threatened, and ultimately redeemed by the woman&#x27;s sacrifice, was staged. Whether this is to be believed or not, it is an exposition of Ziegler&#x27;s view of the ways of the world as a member of the power elite.

===Casting===
When Warner Bros. president Terry Semel approved production in 1995, he asked Kubrick to cast a movie star as &quot;you haven&#x27;t done that since Jack Nicholson [in &quot;The Shining&quot;]&quot;. Kubrick considered casting Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger as Bill and Alice Harford. Cruise was in England because his wife Nicole Kidman was there filming &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), and the pair eventually decided to visit Kubrick&#x27;s estate. After that meeting, the director awarded them the roles. Kubrick also managed to make both not commit to other projects until &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was completed. Kubrick offered Eva Herzigová a role in the film, but she declined.

Jennifer Jason Leigh and Harvey Keitel each were cast in supporting roles and filmed by Kubrick. Reportedly due to scheduling conflicts, both had to drop out. Keitel was first with &quot;Finding Graceland&quot;, then Leigh with &quot;eXistenZ&quot;. They were replaced by Sydney Pollack and Marie Richardson, respectively, in the final cut. Decades later, Keitel said that he had quit after feeling like Kubrick had &quot;disrespected&quot; him; Gary Oldman added that the breaking point was after Kubrick asked Keitel to do dozens of takes for a scene of his character walking through the door. Among the other supporting cast, Alan Cumming later said that he auditioned six times for his small role in the film.

In 2019, it was revealed that Cate Blanchett had provided the voice of the mysterious masked woman at the orgy party. Actress Abigail Good could not do a convincing American accent, and Cruise and Kidman ended up suggesting Blanchett for the dubbing, which occurred after Kubrick&#x27;s death.

===Filming===

Principal photography began in November 1996. Kubrick&#x27;s perfectionism led to script pages being rewritten on the set, and he intentionally filmed many scenes multiple times to try to break down the actors involved and have them give a more authentic performance. One scene of Cruise walking through a door was filmed 95 times. As a result, the shoot went on for much longer than expected. The actress Vinessa Shaw was initially contracted for two weeks and one scene but ended up working for two months. Due to the relentless nature of the production, the crew became exhausted and were reported to have been impacted by low morale. Cruise developed an ulcer but did not tell Kubrick. Filming finally wrapped in June 1998. The &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; as the longest constant movie shoot that ran &quot;...for over 15 months, a period that included an unbroken shoot of 46 weeks&quot;.

Given Kubrick&#x27;s fear of flying, the entire film was shot in England. Sound-stage works were completed at London&#x27;s Pinewood Studios which included a detailed recreation of Greenwich Village. Kubrick&#x27;s perfectionism went as far as sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations. Real New York footage was also shot to be rear projected behind Cruise. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy helped by Kubrick always working with a short team on set. Outdoor locations included Hatton Garden for a Greenwich Village street, Hamleys for the toy store from the film&#x27;s ending, and Mentmore Towers and Elveden Hall in Elveden, Suffolk, England for the mansion. Larry Smith, who had first served as a gaffer on both &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;, was chosen by Kubrick to be the film&#x27;s cinematographer. Wherever possible, Smith made use of available light sources visible in the shots such as lamps and Christmas tree lights, but when this was insufficient he used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene, with other types of film lighting if needed. The color was enhanced by push processing the film reels (emulsion) which helped bring out the intensity of the color and emphasize highlights. This effect is evident in the Christmas party scene at Ziegler&#x27;s house, with Smith noting that the push processing &quot;made the lights appear to be much brighter than they were&quot; and created a &quot;wonderful warm glow.&quot;

Kubrick&#x27;s perfectionism led him to oversee every visual element that would appear in a given frame, from props and furniture to the color of walls and other objects. One such element were the masks used in the orgy which were inspired by the masked carnival balls visited by the protagonists in the novel. Costume designer Marit Allen explained that Kubrick felt they fit in that scene for being part of the imaginary world and ended up &quot;creat[ing] the impression of menace, but without exaggeration&quot;. As many masks as were used in the Venetian carnival were sent to London and Kubrick chose who would wear each piece. The paintings of Kubrick&#x27;s wife Christiane and his daughter Katherina are featured as decorations.

Nicole Kidman revealed that her explicit scenes with the naval officer, played by Gary Goba, were filmed over three days and that Kubrick wanted them to be &quot;almost pornographic&quot;.

After shooting had been completed, Kubrick entered a prolonged post-production process, and on March 1, 1999, Kubrick showed a cut to Cruise, Kidman and the Warner Bros. executives. Kubrick suddenly died six days later.

==Music==
Jocelyn Pook wrote the original music for &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, but, like other Kubrick movies, the film was noted for its use of classical music. The opening title music is Shostakovich&#x27;s Waltz No. 2 from &quot;Suite for Variety Stage Orchestra&quot;, misidentified as &quot;Jazz Suite No. 2&quot;. One recurring piece is the second movement of György Ligeti&#x27;s piano cycle &quot;Musica ricercata&quot;. Kubrick originally intended to feature &quot;Im Treibhaus&quot; from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Wesendonck Lieder&quot;, but the director eventually replaced it with Ligeti&#x27;s piece feeling Wagner&#x27;s song was &quot;too beautiful&quot;. In the morgue scene, Franz Liszt&#x27;s late solo piano piece, &quot;Nuages Gris&quot; (&quot;Grey Clouds&quot;) (1881), is heard. &quot;Rex tremendae&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; plays as Bill walks into the café and reads of Mandy&#x27;s death.

Pook was hired after choreographer Yolande Snaith rehearsed the masked ball orgy scene using Pook&#x27;s composition &quot;Backwards Priests&quot; – which features a Romanian Orthodox Divine Liturgy recorded in a church in Baia Mare, played backwards – as a reference track. Kubrick then called the composer and asked if she had anything else &quot;weird&quot; like that song, which was reworked for the final cut of the scene, with the title &quot;Masked Ball&quot;. Pook ended up composing and recording four pieces of music, many times based on her previous work, totaling 24 minutes. The composer&#x27;s work ended up having mostly string instruments – including a viola played by Pook herself – with no brass or woodwinds as Pook &quot;just couldn&#x27;t justify these other textures&quot;, particularly as she wanted the tracks played on dialogue-heavy scenes to be &quot;subliminal&quot; and felt such instruments would be intrusive.

Another track in the orgy, &quot;Migrations&quot;, features a Tamil song sung by Manickam Yogeswaran, a Carnatic singer. The original cut featured a scriptural recitation from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, which Pook took from a previous Yogeswaran recording. South African Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu group, protested against the scripture being used, Warner Bros. issued a public apology, and hired the singer to record a similar track to replace the chant.

The party at Ziegler&#x27;s house features rearrangements of love songs such as &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;, used in increasingly ironic ways considering how Alice and Bill flirt with other people in the scene. As Kidman was nervous about doing nude scenes, Kubrick stated she could bring her own music for the filming. When Kidman brought a Chris Isaak CD, Kubrick approved it, and incorporated Isaak&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing&quot; to both an early romantic embrace of Bill and Alice and the film&#x27;s trailer.

==Themes and interpretations==
===Genre===
The film was described by some reviewers, and partially marketed, as an erotic thriller, a categorization disputed by others. It is classified as such in the book &quot;The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema&quot;, by Linda Ruth Williams, and was described as such in news articles about Cruise and Kidman&#x27;s lawsuit over assertions that they saw a sex therapist during filming. The positive review in &quot;Combustible Celluloid&quot; describes it as an erotic thriller upon first viewing, but actually a &quot;complex story about marriage and sexuality&quot;. &quot;High-Def Digest&quot; also called it an erotic thriller.

However, reviewing the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards this as a misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Maitland McDonagh writes &quot;No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick&#x27;s work will be surprised that this isn&#x27;t the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest.&quot; Writing in general about the genre of &#x27;erotic thriller&#x27; for &quot;CineAction&quot; in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that &quot;whatever [&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;] actual type, [it] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller&quot;. Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal &quot;Reverse Shot&quot;, writes &quot;this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was  ... setting out to make neither the &#x27;erotic thriller&#x27; that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable &#x27;Kubrick film. &quot;DVD Talk&quot; similarly dissociates the film from this genre.

===Christmas setting===
In addition to relocating the story from Vienna in the 1900s to New York City in the 1990s, Kubrick changed the time-frame of Schnitzler&#x27;s story from Mardi Gras to Christmas. Michael Koresky believed Kubrick did this because of the rejuvenating symbolism of Christmas. Mario Falsetto, on the other hand, notes that Christmas lights allow Kubrick to employ some of his distinct methods of shooting including using source location lighting, as he also did in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that the film &quot;gives an otherworldly radiance and personality to Christmas lights&quot;, and critic Randy Rasmussen notes that &quot;colorful Christmas lights  ... illuminate almost every location in the film.&quot; &quot;Harper&quot;&#x27;s film critic, Lee Siegel, believes that the film&#x27;s recurring motif is the Christmas tree, because it symbolizes the way that &quot;Compared with the everyday reality of sex and emotion, our fantasies of gratification are  ... pompous and solemn in the extreme  ... For desire is like Christmas: it always promises more than it delivers.&quot; Author Tim Kreider notes that the &quot;Satanic&quot; mansion-party at Somerton is the only set in the film without a Christmas tree, stating that &quot;Almost every set is suffused with the dreamlike, hazy glow of colored lights and tinsel.&quot; Furthermore, he argues that &quot;Eyes Wide Shut, though it was released in summer, was &quot;the&quot; Christmas movie of 1999.&quot; Noting that Kubrick has shown viewers the dark side of Christmas consumerism, Louise Kaplan states that the film illustrates ways in which the &quot;material reality of money&quot; is shown replacing the spiritual values of Christmas, charity, and compassion. While virtually every scene has a Christmas tree, there is &quot;no Christmas music or cheery Christmas spirit.&quot; Critic Alonso Duralde, in his book &quot;Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas&quot;, categorized the film as a &quot;Christmas movie for grownups&quot;, arguing that &quot;Christmas weaves its way through the film from start to finish&quot;.

===Use of Venetian masks===
Historians, travel guide authors, novelists, and merchants of Venetian masks have noted that these have a long history of being worn during promiscuous activities. Authors Tim Kreider and Thomas Nelson have linked the film&#x27;s usage of these to Venice&#x27;s reputation as a center of both eroticism and mercantilism. Nelson notes that the sex ritual combines elements of Venetian Carnival and Catholic rites, in particular, the character of &quot;Red Cloak&quot; who simultaneously serves as Grand Inquisitor and King of Carnival. As such, Nelson argues that the sex ritual is a symbolic mirror of the darker truth behind the façade of Victor Ziegler&#x27;s earlier Christmas party. Carolin Ruwe, in her book &quot;Symbols in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Movie &#x27;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;&#x27;, argues that the mask is the prime symbol of the film. Its symbolic meaning is represented through its connection to the characters in the film; as Tim Kreider points out, this can be seen through the masks in the prostitute&#x27;s apartment and her being renamed as &quot;Domino&quot; in the film, which is a type of Venetian Mask. Unused early poster designs for the film by Kubrick&#x27;s daughter Katharina used the motif of Venetian masks, but were rejected by the studio because they obscured the faces of the film&#x27;s two stars.

=== Artwork in the film ===
Paintings and sculptures appear throughout the film, some historical and others painted by Kubrick&#x27;s wife Christiane Kubrick and stepdaughter Katharina Kubrick Hobbs. The home of the Harfords contains the majority of the works painted by Kubrick&#x27;s family members, with the exception being a painting of a nude reclining pregnant woman by Christiane Kubrick titled &quot;Paula On Red&quot; that appears in Ziegler&#x27;s bathroom during the overdose scene. In the beginning of the film, as Bill and Alice are saying goodbye to their daughter Helena and the babysitter, a painting by Christiane Kubrick titled &quot;View from the Mentmore&quot; can be seen hanging next to the Christmas tree. Mentmore Towers is an English country house in the southeast of England that was used for filming the interior scenes of the Somerton house and the masked orgy.

During Ziegler&#x27;s party, Bill is summoned to the bathroom to deal with an apparent overdose, as he climbs the spiral staircase he passes Giulio Bergonzoli&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Gli amori degli angeli&quot; (The Loves of Angels) which is at the foot of the staircase. This sculpture is said to be inspired by a poem titled &quot;The Loves of the Angels&quot; by 19th-century poet Thomas Moore; the poem itself describes the story of three angels who fall in love with mortal women and share the password to heaven with them resulting in their banishment. At the time of the poem&#x27;s release, it was received with controversy due to the open eroticism throughout. During the same party sequence, Bill is talking with the two models as they walk past a small reproduction of Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; sitting on a table.

When Bill enters a cafe towards the end of the film, two Pre-Raphaelite paintings can be seen hanging on parallel walls, &quot;Ophelia&quot; by John William Waterhouse and &quot;Astarte Syriaca&quot; by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Ophelia&quot; depicts the character by the same name in Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy Hamlet moments before her death. &quot;Astarte Syriaca&quot; depicts Astarte, the ancient Syrian goddess of love, as well as two symmetrical angels holding torches directly behind her. Both paintings mirror events within the film and, as Robert Wilkes writes, reflect its &quot;mood of sensuality, ritualism, and exoticism&quot;. In the same cafe scene, a crystoleum print of Maude Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Hush!&quot; (or, &quot;A Moment of Idleness&quot;) is seen behind Bill as he sits down with a newspaper; in the following shot the print is replaced with what Wilkes describes as a &quot;more chaotic, nightmarish image&quot; as Bill reads about the ex-beauty queen&#x27;s apparent overdose.

When Bill is walking through a hospital hallway towards the end of the film, he walks past Jann Haworth&#x27;s painting &quot;Aunt Gurdi Burning&quot; (1995). The painting is oil on canvas and mounted on a screen; it is in the permanent collection of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where the scenes were filmed.

==Release==
===Marketing===
Warner Bros. heavily promoted &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, while following Kubrick&#x27;s secrecy campaign – to the point that the film&#x27;s press kits contained no production notes, not even the director&#x27;s suggestions to Semel regarding the marketing campaign, given one week prior to Kubrick&#x27;s death. The first footage was shown to theater owners attending the 1999 ShoWest convention in Las Vegas. TV spots featured both Isaak and Ligeti&#x27;s music from the soundtrack, while revealing little about the movie&#x27;s plot. The film also appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and on show business programs such as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; opened on July 16, 1999, in the United States. The film topped the week-end box office, with $21.7 million from 2,411 screens. These numbers surpassed the studio&#x27;s expectations of $20 million, and became both Cruise&#x27;s sixth consecutive chart topper and Kubrick&#x27;s highest opening week-end as well as the highest featuring Kidman and Cruise together. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; ended up grossing a total of $55,691,208 in the US. The numbers put it as Kubrick&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film in the country, behind &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, but both were considered a box office disappointment.

Shortly after its screening at the Venice Film Festival, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; had a British premiere on September 3, 1999, at the Warner Village cinema in Leicester Square. The film&#x27;s wide opening occurred the following week-end, and topped the U.K. charts with £1,189,672.

The international performances for &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; were more positive, with Kubrick&#x27;s long-time assistant and brother-in-law Jan Harlan stating that &quot;It was badly received in the Anglo-Saxon world, but it was very well received in the Latin world and Japan. In Italy, it was a huge hit.&quot; Overseas earnings of over $105 million led to a $162,091,208 box office run world-wide, turning it into the highest-grossing Kubrick film.

===Home media===
&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was first released on VHS and DVD on March 7, 2000. The original DVD release corrects technical gaffes, including a reflected crew member, and altering a piece of Alice Harford&#x27;s dialogue. Most home videos remove the verse that was claimed to be cited from the sacred Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita (although it was Pook&#x27;s reworking of &quot;Backwards Priests&quot; as stated above). In the UK, Warner Home Video&#x27;s &#x27;rated 18&#x27; [no video altering] 1999 DVD release was in 4:3 full frame aspect ratio, with a note at the beginning that this was as Kubrick intended it to be shown [ratio as shot]. However, the film&#x27;s length on this UK DVD is only 153 minutes, as opposed to the 159 minutes of other available DVD and Blu-ray versions. This is due to the transfer being done at 25 frames per second rather than 24 as shot; no actual footage was cut.

On October 23, 2007, Warner released &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in a special edition DVD, plus the HD DVD and Blu-ray disc formats. This is the first home video release that presents the film in anamorphic 1.78:1 (16:9) format (the film was shown theatrically as soft matted 1.66:1 in Europe and 1.85:1 in the US and Japan). The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and unrated editions, in actuality only the unrated edition is on the DVD.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s intense study of the human psyche yields an impressive cinematic work.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Over 50 critics listed the film among the best of 1999. French magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; named it the best film of the year in its annual &quot;top ten&quot; list. However, audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Michael Wilmington declared the film a masterpiece, lauding it as &quot;provocatively conceived, gorgeously shot and masterfully executed ... Kubrick&#x27;s brilliantly choreographed one-take scenes create a near-hypnotic atmosphere of commingled desire and dread.&quot; Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was also highly positive, arguing that &quot;the film&#x27;s primal, almost religious intensity and power is primarily derived from its multifaceted realization that disobeying the dictates of society and your conscience can be both terrifying and exhilarating. ... The film&#x27;s depiction of sexual depravity and amorality could easily venture into the realm of camp in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, but Kubrick depicts primal evil in a way that somehow makes it seem both new and deeply terrifying.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a score of three and a half stars out of four, writing, &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s great achievement in the film is to find and hold an odd, unsettling, sometimes erotic tone for the doctor&#x27;s strange encounters.&quot; He praised the individual dream-like atmosphere of the separate scenes, and called the choice of Christmas-themed lighting &quot;garish, like an urban sideshow&quot;.

Reviewer James Berardinelli stated that it was arguably one of Kubrick&#x27;s best films. Along with considering Kidman &quot;consistently excellent&quot;, he wrote that Kubrick &quot;has something to say about the causes and effects of depersonalized sex&quot;, and praised the work as &quot;thought-provoking and unsettling&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewer Janet Maslin commented, &quot;This is a dead-serious film about sexual yearnings, one that flirts with ridicule yet sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. The dreamlike intensity of previous Kubrick visions is in full force here.&quot;

Some reviewers were unfavorable. One complaint was that the movie&#x27;s pacing was too slow; while this may have been intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem laboured. Another complaint was that it did not live up to the expectation of it being a &quot;sexy film&quot; which is what it had been marketed as, thus defying audiences&#x27; expectations. Many critics, such as Manohla Dargis of &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, found the prolific orgy scene to be &quot;banal&quot; and &quot;surprisingly tame&quot;. While Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;pictorial talents&quot; were described as &quot;striking&quot; by Rod Dreher of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the pivotal scene was deemed by Stephen Hunter, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, as the &quot;dullest orgy [he&#x27;d] ever seen&quot;. Hunter elaborates on his criticism, and states that &quot;Kubrick is annoyingly offhand while at the same time grindingly pedantic; plot points are made over and over again, things are explained till the dawn threatens to break in the east, and the movie stumbles along at a glacial pace&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; complained about the inauthenticity of the New York setting, claiming that the soundstage used for the film&#x27;s production didn&#x27;t have &quot;enough bustle&quot; to capture the reality of New York. Paul Tatara of &quot;CNN&quot; described the film as a &quot;slow-motion morality tale full of hot female bodies and thoroughly uneventful &#x27;mystery, while Andrew Sarris writing for &quot;The New York Observer&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s &quot;feeble attempts at melodramatic tension and suspense&quot;. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; dismissed it as &quot;estranged from any period I recognize. Who are these people played by Cruise and Kidman, who act as if no one has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by their newfound knowledge of sexual fantasies—the kind that mainstream culture absorbed at least half a century ago? Who are these aristocrats whose limos take them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions? Even dream plays need some grounding in the real world.&quot; J. Hoberman wrote that the film &quot;feels like a rough draft at best.&quot;

Lee Siegel from &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; felt that most critics responded mainly to the marketing campaign and did not address the film on its own terms. Others felt that American censorship took an esoteric film and made it even harder to understand. In his article &quot;Grotesque Caricature&quot;, published in Postmodern Culture, Stefan Mattesich praises the film&#x27;s nuanced caricatured elements, and states that the film&#x27;s negation of conventional narrative elements is what resulted in its subsequent negative reception.

For the introduction to Michel Ciment&#x27;s &quot;Kubrick: The Definitive Edition&quot;, Martin Scorsese wrote: &quot;When &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; came out a few months after Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you go back and look at the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you&#x27;ll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that &quot;2001&quot; or &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; or &quot;The Shining&quot; was like nothing else before or since.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The British Film Institute ranked the film at No. 19 on its list of &quot;90 great films of the 1990s&quot;. In 2022, IndieWire named the film the best movie of the 1990s. The film was listed at number 61 in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.

===Awards and honors===
==Controversies==
===Debate over the film&#x27;s state of completion===
Though Warner Bros. insisted that Kubrick had turned in his final cut before his death, the film was still in the final stages of post-production, which was therefore completed by the studio in collaboration with Kubrick&#x27;s estate. Some have argued that the work that remained was minor and exclusively technical in nature, allowing the estate to faithfully complete the film based on the director&#x27;s notes. However, decisions regarding sound mixing, scoring and color-correction would have necessarily been made without Kubrick&#x27;s input. Furthermore, Kubrick had a history of continuing to edit his films up until the last minute, and in some cases even after initial public screenings, as had been the case with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Kubrick collaborator Michael Herr recalled a phone call from the director regarding the cut that would be screened for the Warner Bros. executives four days before his death:

Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam, has expressed that he considers &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; to be an unfinished film:

Nicole Kidman, one of the stars of the film, briefly wrote about the completion of the film and the release of the film being at the same time as John F. Kennedy Jr.&#x27;s death from her perspective:

===Kubrick&#x27;s opinion===
Jan Harlan, Kubrick&#x27;s brother-in-law and executive producer, reported that Kubrick was &quot;very happy&quot; with the film and considered it to be his &quot;greatest contribution to the art of cinema&quot;.

R. Lee Ermey, an actor in Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, stated that Kubrick phoned him two weeks before his death to express his despondency over &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. &quot;He told me it was a piece of shit&quot;, Ermey said in &quot;Radar&quot; magazine, &quot;and that he was disgusted with it and that the critics were going to &#x27;have him for lunch&#x27;. He said Cruise and Kidman had their way with him – exactly the words he used.&quot;

According to Todd Field, Kubrick&#x27;s friend and an actor in &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, Ermey&#x27;s claims do not accurately reflect Kubrick&#x27;s essential attitude. Field&#x27;s response appeared in an October 18, 2006, interview with Grouch Reviews:

The polite thing would be to say &#x27;No comment&#x27;. But the truth is that  ... let&#x27;s put it this way, you&#x27;ve never seen two actors more completely subservient and prostrate themselves at the feet of a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for &quot;In the Bedroom&quot;. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn&#x27;t work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won&#x27;t get into because there is no reason to do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.

===Studio censorship and classification===
Citing contractual obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the film&#x27;s American release by blocking out graphic sexuality using additional figures to obscure the view in order to avoid an adults-only NC-17 rating that would have limited its financial viability. This alteration antagonized both film critics and cinephiles, who argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was originally given an X rating). The unrated version of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray formats.

Roger Ebert heavily criticized the technique of using digital images to mask the action. In his positive review of the film, he said it &quot;should not have been done at all&quot; and it is &quot;symbolic of the moral hypocrisy of the rating system that it would force a great director to compromise his vision, while by the same process making his adult film more accessible to young viewers.&quot; Although Ebert has been frequently cited as calling the standard North American R-rated version the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; version of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; – referring to two scenes in &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; in which, through camera angles and coincidences, full frontal nudity is blocked from view in a comical way – his review stated that this joke referred to an early rough draft of the altered scene, never publicly released.
