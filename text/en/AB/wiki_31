<text>Aquilegia (common names: granny&#x27;s bonnet, columbine) is a genus of about 130 species of perennial plants that are found in meadows, woodlands, and at higher elevations throughout the Northern Hemisphere, known for the spurred petals of their flowers.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Aquilegia&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;Aquila&quot;, or &quot;eagle&quot;; this is in obvious reference to the spurred, &quot;hook&quot; shapes within the blooms, that many gardeners say resemble an eagle&#x27;s talons.

==Description==

Perennial herbs, with woody, erect stock, roots forming thick rhizomes. The basal leaves are compound, 1–3 ternate, blades 3-lobed -partite, and lobes lobulate and obtuse. The cauline leaves are similar to the basal ones, while the upper ones are bract like.

The hermaphrodite (bisexual) flowers are terminal to stem and branches. They are usually pentamerous (with five spreading perianth petaloid sepal segments). Five tubular honey-leaves are semi erect with a flat limb and spurred or saccate at the base. The spur is directed backwards and secretes nectar. Stamens are numerous (often more than 50) in whorls of 5, the innermost being scarious staminodes. There are ten membranaceous intrastaminal scales. There are five pistils and the carpels are free.

The fruit has several (five to 15) follicles which are semi erect and slightly connate downwards. These hold many seeds and are formed at the end of the pistils. The nectar is mainly consumed by long-beaked birds such as hummingbirds. Almost all &quot;Aquilegia&quot; species have a ring of staminodia around the base of the stigma, which may help protect against insects. Chromosome number is x=7.

==Relatives==

Columbines are closely related to plants in the genera &quot;Actaea&quot; (baneberries) and &quot;Aconitum&quot; (wolfsbanes/monkshoods), which like &quot;Aquilegia&quot; produce cardiogenic toxins.

==Insects==
They are used as food plants by some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) caterpillars. These are mainly of noctuid moths – noted for feeding on many poisonous plants without harm – such as cabbage moth (&quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;), dot moth (&quot;Melanchra persicariae&quot;) and mouse moth (&quot;Amphipyra tragopoginis&quot;). The engrailed (&quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;), a geometer moth, also uses columbine as a larval food plant. The larvae of the &quot;Papaipema leucostigma&quot; also feed on columbine.

Plants in the genus &quot;Aquilegia&quot; are a major food source for &quot;Bombus hortorum&quot;, a species of bumblebee. Specifically, they have been found to forage on species of &quot;Aquilegia vulgaris&quot; in Belgium and &quot;Aquilegia chrysantha&quot; in North America and Belgium. The bees do not show any preference in color of the flowers.

==Cultivation==
Columbine is a hardy perennial, which propagates by seed. It will grow to a height of . It will grow in full sun; however, it prefers growing in partial shade and well drained soil, and is able to tolerate average soils and dry soil conditions. Columbine is rated at hardiness zone 3 in the United States so does not require mulching or protection in the winter.

Large numbers of hybrids are available for the garden, since the European &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; was hybridized with other European and North American varieties.
 &quot;Aquilegia&quot; species are very interfertile, and will self-sow. Some varieties are short-lived so are better treated as biennials.
The British National Collection of &quot;Aquilegia&quot;s was held by Mrs Carrie Thomas at Killay near Swansea. Some time during or before 2014 the collection started to succumb to Aquilegia Downy Mildew &quot;Peronospora aquilegiicola&quot; which was at the time an emerging disease to which the plants had no resistance. By 2018 the entire collection had been lost. Aquilegia can be grown from seeds or rhizomes.

==Uses==

The flowers of various species of columbine were consumed in moderation by Native Americans as a condiment with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet, and safe if consumed in small quantities. The plant&#x27;s seeds and roots, however, are highly poisonous and contain cardiogenic toxins which cause both severe gastroenteritis and heart palpitations if consumed as food. Native Americans used very small amounts of &quot;Aquilegia&quot; root as a treatment for ulcers. However, the medical use of this plant is better avoided due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings may be fatal.

An acute toxicity test in mice has demonstrated that ethanol extract mixed with isocytisoside, the main flavonoid compound from the leaves and stems of &quot;Aquilegia vulgaris&quot;, can be classified as non-toxic, since a dose of 3000 mg/kg did not cause mortality.

==Culture==
The Colorado blue columbine (&quot;A. coerulea&quot;) is the official state flower of Colorado (see also Columbine, Colorado). It is also used as a symbol of the former city of Scarborough in the Canadian province of Ontario.
==Evolution==

Columbines have been important in the study of evolution. It was found that the Sierra columbine (&quot;A. pubescens&quot;) and crimson columbine (&quot;A. formosa&quot;) each has adapted specifically to a pollinator. Bees and hummingbirds are the visitors to &quot;A. formosa&quot;, while hawkmoths would only visit &quot;A. pubescens&quot; when given a choice. Such a &quot;pollination syndrome&quot;, being due to flower color and orientation controlled by their genetics, ensures reproductive isolation and can be a cause of speciation.

&quot;Aquilegia&quot; petals show an enormous range of petal spur length diversity ranging from a centimeter to the 15 cm spurs of &quot;Aquilegia longissima&quot;. Selection from pollinator shifts is suggested to have driven these changes in nectar spur length. 
It was shown that this spur length diversity is achieved solely through changing cell shape, not cell number or cell size. This suggests that a simple microscopic change can result in a dramatic evolutionarily relevant morphological change.

<doc id="6829" wikidata="Q165596" url="?curid=6829" title="Cache (computing)">
<text>In computing, a cache ( ) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.

To be cost-effective, caches must be relatively small. Nevertheless, caches are effective in many areas of computing because typical computer applications access data with a high degree of locality of reference. Such access patterns exhibit temporal locality, where data is requested that has been recently requested, and spatial locality, where data is requested that is stored near data that has already been requested.

==Motivation==
In memory design, there is an inherent trade-off between capacity and speed because larger capacity implies larger size and thus greater physical distances for signals to travel causing propagation delays. There is also a tradeoff between high-performance technologies such as SRAM and cheaper, easily mass-produced commodities such as DRAM, flash, or hard disks.

The buffering provided by a cache benefits one or both of latency and throughput (bandwidth).

A larger resource incurs a significant latency for access – e.g. it can take hundreds of clock cycles for a modern 4 GHz processor to reach DRAM. This is mitigated by reading large chunks into the cache, in the hope that subsequent reads will be from nearby locations and can be read from the cache. Prediction or explicit prefetching can be used to guess where future reads will come from and make requests ahead of time; if done optimally, the latency is bypassed altogether.

The use of a cache also allows for higher throughput from the underlying resource, by assembling multiple fine-grain transfers into larger, more efficient requests. In the case of DRAM circuits, the additional throughput may be gained by using a wider data bus.

==Operation==
Hardware implements cache as a block of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again. Central processing units (CPUs), solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) frequently include hardware-based cache, while web browsers and web servers commonly rely on software caching.

A cache is made up of a pool of entries. Each entry has associated &quot;data&quot;, which is a copy of the same data in some &quot;backing store&quot;. Each entry also has a &quot;tag&quot;, which specifies the identity of the data in the backing store of which the entry is a copy.

When the cache client (a CPU, web browser, operating system) needs to access data presumed to exist in the backing store, it first checks the cache. If an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired data, the data in the entry is used instead. This situation is known as a cache hit. For example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular URL. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the content of the web page is the data. The percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the hit rate or hit ratio of the cache.

The alternative situation, when the cache is checked and found not to contain any entry with the desired tag, is known as a cache miss. This requires a more expensive access of data from the backing store. Once the requested data is retrieved, it is typically copied into the cache, ready for the next access.

During a cache miss, some other previously existing cache entry is typically removed in order to make room for the newly retrieved data. The heuristic used to select the entry to replace is known as the replacement policy. One popular replacement policy, least recently used (LRU), replaces the oldest entry, the entry that was accessed less recently than any other entry. More sophisticated caching algorithms also take into account the frequency of use of entries.

===Write policies===

Cache writes must eventually be propagated to the backing store. The timing for this is governed by the &quot;write policy&quot;. The two primary write policies are:
* &quot;Write-through&quot;: Writes are performed synchronously to both the cache and the backing store.
* &quot;Write-back&quot;: Initially, writing is done only to the cache. The write to the backing store is postponed until the modified content is about to be replaced by another cache block.

A write-back cache is more complex to implement since it needs to track which of its locations have been written over and mark them as &quot;dirty&quot; for later writing to the backing store. The data in these locations are written back to the backing store only when they are evicted from the cache, a process referred to as a &quot;lazy write&quot;. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache may require two memory accesses to the backing store: one to write back the dirty data, and one to retrieve the requested data. Other policies may also trigger data write-back. The client may make many changes to data in the cache, and then explicitly notify the cache to write back the data.

Write operations do not return data. Consequently, a decision needs to be made for write misses: whether or not to load the data into the cache. This is determined by these &quot;write-miss policies&quot;:
* &quot;Write allocate&quot; (also called &quot;fetch on write&quot;): Data at the missed-write location is loaded to cache, followed by a write-hit operation. In this approach, write misses are similar to read misses.
* &quot;No-write allocate&quot; (also called &quot;write-no-allocate&quot; or &quot;write around&quot;): Data at the missed-write location is not loaded to cache, and is written directly to the backing store. In this approach, data is loaded into the cache on read misses only.

While both write policies can Implement either write-miss policy, they are typically paired as follows:
* A write-back cache typically employs write allocate, anticipating that subsequent writes or reads to the same location will benefit from having the data already in the cache.
* A write-through cache uses no-write allocate. Here, subsequent writes have no advantage, since they still need to be written directly to the backing store.

Entities other than the cache may change the data in the backing store, in which case the copy in the cache may become out-of-date or &quot;stale&quot;. Alternatively, when the client updates the data in the cache, copies of that data in other caches will become stale. Communication protocols between the cache managers that keep the data consistent are associated with cache coherence.

===Prefetch===

On a cache read miss, caches with a &quot;demand paging policy&quot; read the minimum amount from the backing store. A typical demand-paging virtual memory implementation reads one page of virtual memory (often 4 KB) from disk into the disk cache in RAM. A typical CPU reads a single L2 cache line of 128 bytes from DRAM into the L2 cache, and a single L1 cache line of 64 bytes from the L2 cache into the L1 cache.

Caches with a prefetch input queue or more general &quot;anticipatory paging policy&quot; go further—they not only read the data requested, but guess that the next chunk or two of data will soon be required, and so prefetch that data into the cache ahead of time. Anticipatory paging is especially helpful when the backing store has a long latency to read the first chunk and much shorter times to sequentially read the next few chunks, such as disk storage and DRAM.

A few operating systems go further with a loader that always pre-loads the entire executable into RAM. A few caches go even further, not only pre-loading an entire file, but also starting to load other related files that may soon be requested, such as the page cache associated with a prefetcher or the web cache associated with link prefetching.

==Examples of hardware caches==
===CPU cache===

Small memories on or close to the CPU can operate faster than the much larger main memory. Most CPUs since the 1980s have used one or more caches, sometimes in cascaded levels; modern high-end embedded, desktop and server microprocessors may have as many as six types of cache (between levels and functions). Some examples of caches with a specific function are the D-cache, I-cache and the translation lookaside buffer for the memory management unit (MMU).

===GPU cache===
Earlier graphics processing units (GPUs) often had limited read-only texture caches and used swizzling to improve 2D locality of reference. Cache misses would drastically affect performance, e.g. if mipmapping was not used. Caching was important to leverage 32-bit (and wider) transfers for texture data that was often as little as 4 bits per pixel.

As GPUs advanced, supporting general-purpose computing on graphics processing units and compute kernels, they have developed progressively larger and increasingly general caches, including instruction caches for shaders, exhibiting functionality commonly found in CPU caches. These caches have grown to handle synchronization primitives between threads and atomic operations, and interface with a CPU-style MMU.

===DSPs===
Digital signal processors have similarly generalized over the years. Earlier designs used scratchpad memory fed by direct memory access, but modern DSPs such as Qualcomm Hexagon often include a very similar set of caches to a CPU (e.g. Modified Harvard architecture with shared L2, split L1 I-cache and D-cache).

===Translation lookaside buffer===

A memory management unit (MMU) that fetches page table entries from main memory has a specialized cache, used for recording the results of virtual address to physical address translations. This specialized cache is called a translation lookaside buffer (TLB).

==In-network cache==
===Information-centric networking===
Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the end-to-end principle, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information. Due to the inherent caching capability of the nodes in an ICN, it can be viewed as a loosely connected network of caches, which has unique requirements for caching policies. However, ubiquitous content caching introduces the challenge to content protection against unauthorized access, which requires extra care and solutions.

Unlike proxy servers, in ICN the cache is a network-level solution. Therefore, it has rapidly changing cache states and higher request arrival rates; moreover, smaller cache sizes impose different requirements on the content eviction policies. In particular, eviction policies for ICN should be fast and lightweight. Various cache replication and eviction schemes for different ICN architectures and applications have been proposed.

====Policies====
=====Time aware least recently used=====
The time aware least recently used (TLRU) is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid lifetime. The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as ICN, content delivery networks (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: time to use (TTU). TTU is a time stamp on content which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and information from the content publisher. Owing to this locality-based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in-network storage.

In the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally-defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and short-lived content should be replaced with incoming content.

=====Least frequent recently used=====
The least frequent recently used (LFRU) cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU is suitable for network cache applications, such as ICN, CDNs and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be seen as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done by first evicting content from the unprivileged partition, then pushing content from the privileged partition to the unprivileged partition, and finally inserting new content into the privileged partition. In the above procedure, the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition. The basic idea is to cache the locally popular content with the ALFU scheme and push the popular content to the privileged partition.

====Weather forecast====
In 2011, the use of smartphones with weather forecasting options was overly taxing AccuWeather servers; two requests from the same area would generate separate requests. An optimization by edge-servers to truncate the GPS coordinates to fewer decimal places meant that the cached results from a nearby query would be used. The number of to-the-server lookups per day dropped by half.

==Software caches==
===Disk cache===
While CPU caches are generally managed entirely by hardware, a variety of software manages other caches. The page cache in main memory is managed by the operating system kernel.

While the disk buffer, which is an integrated part of the hard disk drive or solid state drive, is sometimes misleadingly referred to as &quot;disk cache&quot;, its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching. High-end disk controllers often have their own on-board cache for the hard disk drive&#x27;s data blocks.

Finally, a fast local hard disk drive can also cache information held on even slower data storage devices, such as remote servers (web cache) or local tape drives or optical jukeboxes; such a scheme is the main concept of hierarchical storage management. Also, fast flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) can be used as caches for slower rotational-media hard disk drives, working together as hybrid drives.

===Web cache===

Web browsers and web proxy servers employ web caches to store previous responses from web servers, such as web pages and images. Web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network, as information previously stored in the cache can often be re-used. This reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server, and helps to improve responsiveness for users of the web.

Web browsers employ a built-in web cache, but some Internet service providers (ISPs) or organizations also use a caching proxy server, which is a web cache that is shared among all users of that network.

Another form of cache is P2P caching, where the files most sought for by peer-to-peer applications are stored in an ISP cache to accelerate P2P transfers. Similarly, decentralised equivalents exist, which allow communities to perform the same task for P2P traffic, for example, Corelli.

===Memoization===

A cache can store data that is computed on demand rather than retrieved from a backing store. Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of resource-consuming function calls within a lookup table, allowing subsequent calls to reuse the stored results and avoid repeated computation. It is related to the dynamic programming algorithm design methodology, which can also be thought of as a means of caching.

===Content delivery network===

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the web page and the content delivery server.

CDNs began in the late 1990s as a way to speed up the delivery of static content, such as HTML pages, images and videos. By replicating content on multiple servers around the world and delivering it to users based on their location, CDNs can significantly improve the speed and availability of a website or application. When a user requests a piece of content, the CDN will check to see if it has a copy of the content in its cache. If it does, the CDN will deliver the content to the user from the cache.

===Cloud storage gateway===

A cloud storage gateway, also known as an edge filer, is a hybrid cloud storage device that connects a local network to one or more cloud storage services, typically object storage services such as Amazon S3. It provides a cache for frequently accessed data, providing high speed local access to frequently accessed data in the cloud storage service. Cloud storage gateways also provide additional benefits such as accessing cloud object storage through traditional file serving protocols as well as continued access to cached data during connectivity outages.

===Other caches===
The BIND DNS daemon caches a mapping of domain names to IP addresses, as does a resolver library.

Write-through operation is common when operating over unreliable networks (like an Ethernet LAN), because of the enormous complexity of the coherency protocol required between multiple write-back caches when communication is unreliable. For instance, web page caches and client-side network file system caches (like those in NFS or SMB) are typically read-only or write-through specifically to keep the network protocol simple and reliable.

Search engines also frequently make web pages they have indexed available from their cache. For example, Google provides a &quot;Cached&quot; link next to each search result. This can prove useful when web pages from a web server are temporarily or permanently inaccessible.

Database caching can substantially improve the throughput of database applications, for example in the processing of indexes, data dictionaries, and frequently used subsets of data.

A distributed cache uses networked hosts to provide scalability, reliability and performance to the application. The hosts can be co-located or spread over different geographical regions.

==Buffer vs. cache==

The semantics of a &quot;buffer&quot; and a &quot;cache&quot; are not totally different; even so, there are fundamental differences in intent between the process of caching and the process of buffering.

Fundamentally, caching realizes a performance increase for transfers of data that is being repeatedly transferred. While a caching system may realize a performance increase upon the initial (typically write) transfer of a data item, this performance increase is due to buffering occurring within the caching system.

With read caches, a data item must have been fetched from its residing location at least once in order for subsequent reads of the data item to realize a performance increase by virtue of being able to be fetched from the cache&#x27;s (faster) intermediate storage rather than the data&#x27;s residing location. With write caches, a performance increase of writing a data item may be realized upon the first write of the data item by virtue of the data item immediately being stored in the cache&#x27;s intermediate storage, deferring the transfer of the data item to its residing storage at a later stage or else occurring as a background process. Contrary to strict buffering, a caching process must adhere to a (potentially distributed) cache coherency protocol in order to maintain consistency between the cache&#x27;s intermediate storage and the location where the data resides. Buffering, on the other hand,

* reduces the number of transfers for otherwise novel data amongst communicating processes, which amortizes overhead involved for several small transfers over fewer, larger transfers,
* provides an intermediary for communicating processes which are incapable of direct transfers amongst each other, or
* ensures a minimum data size or representation required by at least one of the communicating processes involved in a transfer.

With typical caching implementations, a data item that is read or written for the first time is effectively being buffered; and in the case of a write, mostly realizing a performance increase for the application from where the write originated. Additionally, the portion of a caching protocol where individual writes are deferred to a batch of writes is a form of buffering. The portion of a caching protocol where individual reads are deferred to a batch of reads is also a form of buffering, although this form may negatively impact the performance of at least the initial reads (even though it may positively impact the performance of the sum of the individual reads). In practice, caching almost always involves some form of buffering, while strict buffering does not involve caching.

A buffer is a temporary memory location that is traditionally used because CPU instructions cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices. Thus, addressable memory is used as an intermediate stage. Additionally, such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled (as required by a storage device), or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced. Also, a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially (for example to hard disk), so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance or reduces the variation or jitter of the transfer&#x27;s latency as opposed to caching where the intent is to reduce the latency. These benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the buffer once and read from the buffer once.

A cache also increases transfer performance. A part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block. But the main performance-gain occurs because there is a good chance that the same data will be read from cache multiple times, or that written data will soon be read. A cache&#x27;s sole purpose is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage. Cache is also usually an abstraction layer that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighboring layers.

<text>Columbus () is a city in, and the county seat of, Bartholomew County, Indiana, United States. The population was 50,474 at the 2020 census. The city is known for its architectural significance, having commissioned noted works of modern architecture and public art since the mid-20th century; the annual program Exhibit Columbus celebrates this legacy. Located about south of Indianapolis, on the east fork of the White River, it is the state&#x27;s 20th-largest city. It is the principal city of the Columbus, Indiana metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Bartholomew County. Columbus is the birthplace of former Indiana Governor and former Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence.

Columbus is the headquarters of the engine company Cummins. In 2004 the city was named as one of &quot;The Ten Most Playful Towns&quot; by &quot;Nick Jr. Family Magazine&quot;. In the July 2005 edition of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Columbus was named as one of the &quot;62 Reasons to Love Your Country&quot;. Columbus won the national contest &quot;America in Bloom&quot; in 2006, and in late 2008, &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; ranked Columbus 11th on its historic destinations list, describing the city as &quot;authentic, unique, and unspoiled.&quot;

==History==
The land developed as Columbus was bought by General John Tipton and Luke Bonesteel in 1820. Tipton built a log cabin on Mount Tipton, a small hill overlooking White River and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. It held wetlands of the river. The town was first known as Tiptona, named in honor of Tipton. The town&#x27;s name was changed to Columbus on March 20, 1821. Many people believe Tipton was upset by the name change, but no evidence exists to prove this. Nonetheless, he decided to leave the newly founded town and did not return.

Tipton was later appointed as the highway commissioner for the State of Indiana and was assigned to building a highway from Indianapolis, Indiana to Louisville, Kentucky. When the road approached Columbus, Tipton constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of Columbus en route to Seymour.

Joseph McKinney was the first to plot the town of Columbus, but no date was recorded. Local history books for years said that the land on which Columbus sits was donated by Tipton. But in 2003, Historic Columbus Indiana acquired a deed showing that Tipton had sold the land.

A ferry was established below the confluence of the Flatrock and Driftwood rivers, which form the White River. A village of three or four log cabins developed around the ferry landing, and a store was added in 1821. Later that year, Bartholomew County was organized by an act of the State Legislature and named to honor the famous Hoosier militiaman, General Joseph Bartholomew. Columbus was incorporated on June 28, 1864.

The first railroad in Indiana was constructed to Columbus from Madison, Indiana in 1844. This eventually became the Madison branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The railroad fostered the growth of the community into one of the largest in Indiana, and three more railroads reached the city by 1850.

The Crump Theatre in Columbus, built in 1889 by John Crump, is the oldest theater in Indiana. Today the building is included within the Columbus Historic District. Before it closed permanently in 2010, it was an all-ages venue with occasional musical performances.

The Cummins Bookstore began operations in the city in 1892. Until late 2007, when it closed, it was the oldest continually operated bookstore in Indiana.

The Irwin Union Bank building was built in 1954. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 2001 in recognition of its unique architecture. The building consists of a one-story bank structure adjacent to a three-story office annex. A portion of the office annex was built along with the banking hall in 1954. The remaining larger portion, designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, was built in 1973. Eero Saarinen designed the bank building with its glazed hall to be set off against the blank background of its three-story brick annex. Two steel and glass vestibule connectors lead from the north side of this structure to the annex. The building was designed to distance the Irwin Union Bank from traditional banking architecture, which mostly echoed imposing, neoclassical style buildings of brick or stone. Tellers were behind iron bars and removed from their customers. Saarinen worked to develop a building that would welcome customers rather than intimidate them.

==Economy==

Columbus has been home to many manufacturing companies, including Noblitt-Sparks Industries, which built radios under the Arvin brand in the 1930s, and Arvin Industries, now Meritor After merging with Meritor Automotive on July 10, 2000, the headquarters of the newly created ArvinMeritor Industries was established in Troy, Michigan, the home of parent company, Rockwell International. It was announced in February 2011 that the company name would revert to Meritor, Inc.

Cummins is by far the region&#x27;s largest employer, and the Infotech Park in Columbus accounts for a sizable number of research jobs in the city itself. Just south of Columbus are the North American headquarters of Toyota Material Handling, the world&#x27;s largest material handling (forklift) manufacturer.

Other notable industries include architecture, a discipline for which Columbus is famous worldwide. The late Joseph Irwin Miller (then president and chairman of Cummins) launched the Cummins Foundation, a charitable program that helps subsidize a large number of architectural projects throughout the city by up-and-coming engineers and architects.

Early in the 20th century, Columbus also was home to a number of pioneering car manufacturers, including Reeves, which produced the unusual four-axle Octoauto and the twin rear-axle Sextoauto, both around 1911.

==Arts and culture==

Columbus is a city known for its modern architecture and public art. J. Irwin Miller, 2nd CEO and a nephew of a co-founder of Cummins, the Columbus-headquartered diesel engine manufacturer, instituted a program in which the Cummins Foundation paid the architects&#x27; fees, provided the client selected a firm from a list compiled by the foundation. The plan was initiated with public schools and was so successful that the foundation decided to offer such design support to other non-profit and civic organizations. The high number of notable public buildings and public art in the Columbus area, designed by such individuals as Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, Robert Venturi, Cesar Pelli, and Richard Meier, led to Columbus earning the nickname &quot;Athens on the Prairie.&quot;

Seven buildings, constructed between 1942 and 1965, are National Historic Landmarks, and approximately 60 other buildings sustain the Bartholomew County seat&#x27;s reputation as a showcase of modern architecture. National Public Radio once devoted an article to the town&#x27;s architecture.

In 2015, Landmark Columbus was created as a program of Heritage Fund - The Community Foundation of Bartholomew county.

In addition to the Columbus Historic District and Irwin Union Bank, the city has numerous buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including seven National Historic Landmarks of modernist architecture: Bartholomew County Courthouse, Columbus City Hall, First Baptist Church, First Christian Church, Haw Creek Leather Company, Mabel McDowell Elementary School, McEwen-Samuels-Marr House, McKinley School, Miller House, North Christian Church, and The Republic Newspaper Office.

The city is the basis for the 2017 film &quot;Columbus&quot; by independent filmmaker Kogonada. The film was shot on location in Columbus over 18 days in the summer of 2016.

<text>This is a list of computer scientists, people who do work in computer science, in particular researchers and authors.

Some persons notable as programmers are included here because they work in research as well as program. A few of these people pre-date the invention of the digital computer; they are now regarded as computer scientists because their work can be seen as leading to the invention of the computer. Others are mathematicians whose work falls within what would now be called theoretical computer science, such as complexity theory and algorithmic information theory.

<text>Reaction kinetics in uniform supersonic flow (, CRESU) is an experiment investigating chemical reactions taking place at very low temperatures.

The technique involves the expansion of a gas or mixture of gases through a de Laval nozzle from a high-pressure reservoir into a vacuum chamber. As it expands, the nozzle collimates the gas into a uniform supersonic beam, which is essentially collision-free and has a temperature that, in the centre-of-mass frame, can be significantly below that of the reservoir gas. Each nozzle produces a characteristic temperature. This way, any temperature between room temperature and about 10 K can be achieved.

==Apparatus==
There are relatively few CRESU apparatuses in existence for the simple reason that the gas throughput and pumping requirements are huge, which makes them expensive to run. Two of the leading centres have been the University of Rennes (France) and the University of Birmingham (UK). A more recent development has been a pulsed version of the CRESU, which requires far less gas and therefore smaller pumps.

==Kinetics==
Most species have a negligible vapour pressure at such low temperatures, and this means that they quickly condense on the sides of the apparatus. Essentially, the CRESU technique provides a &quot;wall-less flow tube&quot;, which allows the kinetics of gas-phase reactions to be investigated at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible.

Chemical kinetics experiments can then be carried out in a pump–probe fashion, using a laser to initiate the reaction (for example, by preparing one of the reagents by photolysis of a precursor), followed by observation of that same species (for example, by laser-induced fluorescence) after a known time delay. The fluorescence signal is captured by a photomultiplier a known distance downstream of the de Laval nozzle. The time delay can be varied up to the maximum corresponding to the flow time over that known distance. By studying how quickly the reagent species disappears in the presence of differing concentrations of a (usually stable) co-reagent species, the reaction rate constant at the low temperature of the CRESU flow can be determined.

Reactions studied by the CRESU technique typically have no significant activation energy barrier. In the case of neutral–neutral reactions (i.e., not involving any charged species, ions), these type of barrier-free reactions usually involve free radical species, such as molecular oxygen (O2), the cyanide radical (CN) or the hydroxyl radical (OH). The energetic driving force for these reactions is typically an attractive long-range intermolecular potential.

CRESU experiments have been used to show deviations from Arrhenius kinetics at low temperatures: as the temperature is reduced, the rate constant actually increases. They can explain why chemistry is so prevalent in the interstellar medium, where many different polyatomic species have been detected (by radio astronomy).

<doc id="6840" wikidata="Q216192" url="?curid=6840" title="Cygwin">
<text>Cygwin ( ) is a free and open-source Unix-like environment and command-line interface (CLI) for Microsoft Windows. The project also provides a software repository containing open-source packages. Cygwin allows source code for Unix-like operating systems to be compiled and run on Windows. Cygwin provides native integration of Windows-based applications. 

The terminal emulator Mintty is the default command-line interface (CLI) provided to interact with the environment. The Cygwin installation directory layout mimics the root file system of Unix-like systems, with directories such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5.

Cygwin is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3. It was originally developed by Cygnus Solutions, which was later acquired by Red Hat (now part of IBM), to port the GNU toolchain to Win32, including the GNU Compiler Suite. Rather than rewrite the tools to use the Win32 runtime environment, Cygwin implemented a POSIX-compatible environment in the form of a DLL.

The brand motto is &quot;Get that Linux feeling – on Windows&quot;, although Cygwin doesn&#x27;t have Linux in it.

== History ==

Cygwin began in 1995 as a project of Steve Chamberlain, a Cygnus engineer who observed that Windows NT and 95 used COFF as their object file format, and that GNU already included support for x86 and COFF, and the C library newlib. He thought that it would be possible to retarget GCC and produce a cross compiler generating executables that could run on Windows. A prototype was later developed. Chamberlain bootstrapped the compiler on a Windows system, to emulate Unix to let the GNU configure shell script run.

Initially, Cygwin was called &quot;Cygwin32&quot;. When Microsoft registered the trademark Win32, the &quot;32&quot; was dropped to simply become &quot;Cygwin&quot;.

In 1999, Cygnus offered Cygwin 1.0 as a commercial product. Subsequent versions have not been released, instead relying on continued open source releases.

Geoffrey Noer was the project lead from 1996 to 1999. Christopher Faylor was lead from 1999 to 2004; he left Red Hat and became co-lead with Corinna Vinschen. Corinna Vinschen has been the project lead from mid-2014 to date (as of September, 2024).

From June 23, 2016, the Cygwin library version 2.5.2 was licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3.

== Description ==
Cygwin is provided in two versions: the full 64-bit version and a stripped-down 32-bit version, whose final version was released in 2022. Cygwin consists of a library that implements the POSIX system call API in terms of Windows system calls to enable the running of a large number of application programs equivalent to those on Unix systems, and a GNU development toolchain (including GCC and GDB). Programmers have ported the X Window System, K Desktop Environment 3, GNOME, Apache, and TeX. Cygwin permits installing inetd, syslogd, sshd, Apache, and other daemons as standard Windows services. Cygwin programs have full access to the Windows API and other Windows libraries.

Cygwin programs are installed by running Cygwin&#x27;s &quot;setup&quot; program, which downloads them from repositories on the Internet.

The Cygwin API library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (or later), with an exception to allow linking to any free and open-source software whose license conforms to the Open Source Definition.

Cygwin consists of two parts:
# A dynamic-link library in the form of a C standard library that acts as a compatibility layer for the POSIX API and
# A collection of software tools and applications that provide a Unix-like look and feel.
Cygwin supports POSIX symbolic links, representing them as plain-text files with the system attribute set. Cygwin 1.5 represented them as Windows Explorer shortcuts, but this was changed for reasons of performance and POSIX correctness. Cygwin also recognises NTFS junction points and symbolic links and treats them as POSIX symbolic links, but it does not create them. The POSIX API for handling access control lists (ACLs) is supported.

=== Technical details ===
A Cygwin-specific version of the Unix codice_6 command allows mounting Windows paths as &quot;filesystems&quot; in the Unix file space. Initial mount points can be configured in codice_7, which has a format very similar to Unix systems, except that Windows paths appear in place of devices. Filesystems can be mounted in binary mode (by default), or in text mode, which enables automatic conversion between LF and CRLF endings (which only affects programs that open files without explicitly specifying text or binary mode).

Cygwin 1.7 introduced comprehensive support for POSIX locales, and the UTF-8 Unicode encoding became the default.

The fork system call for duplicating a process is fully implemented, but the copy-on-write optimization strategy could not be used.

The Cygwin DLL contains a console driver that emulates a Unix-style terminal within the Windows console. Cygwin&#x27;s default user interface is the bash shell running in the Cygwin console. The DLL also implements pseudo terminal (pty) devices. Cygwin ships with a number of terminal emulators that are based on them, including mintty, rxvt/urxvt, and xterm. The version of GCC that comes with Cygwin has various extensions for creating Windows DLLs, such as specifying whether a program is a windowing or console-mode program. Support for compiling programs that do not require the POSIX compatibility layer provided by the Cygwin DLL used to be included in the default GCC, but , it is provided by cross-compilers contributed by the MinGW-w64 project.

== Software packages ==
Cygwin&#x27;s base package selection is approximately 100MB, containing the bash (interactive user) and dash (installation) shells and the core file and text manipulation utilities. Additional packages are available as optional installs from within the Cygwin &quot;setup&quot; program and package manager (&quot;setup-x86_64.exe&quot; – 64 bit). The Cygwin Ports project provided additional packages that were not available in the Cygwin distribution itself. Examples included GNOME, K Desktop Environment 3, MySQL database, and the PHP scripting language. Most ports have been adopted by volunteer maintainers as Cygwin packages, and Cygwin Ports are no longer maintained. Cygwin ships with GTK+ and Qt.

The Cygwin/X project allows graphical Unix programs to display their user interfaces on the Windows desktop for both local and remote programs.

<doc id="6845" wikidata="Q103011" url="?curid=6845" title="Corinth">
<text>Corinth ( ; , ) is a municipality in Corinthia in Greece. The successor to the ancient city of Corinth, it is a former municipality in Corinthia, Peloponnese, which is located in south-central Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it has been part of the municipality of Corinth, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It is the capital of Corinthia.

It was founded as Nea Korinthos (), or New Corinth, in 1858 after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of the ancient city.

== History ==

Corinth derives its name from Ancient Corinth, a city-state of antiquity. The site was occupied from before 3000 BC.

=== Ancient Greece ===
Historical references begin with the early 8th century BC, when ancient Corinth began to develop as a commercial center. Between the 8th and 7th centuries, the Bacchiad family ruled Corinth. Cypselus overthrew the Bacchiad family, and between 657 and 585 BC, he and his son Periander ruled Corinth as the Tyrants.

In about 585 BC, an oligarchical government seized power. This government later allied with Sparta within the Peloponnesian League, and Corinth participated in the Persian Wars and Peloponnesian War as an ally of Sparta. After Sparta&#x27;s victory in the Peloponnesian war, the two allies fell out with one another, and Corinth pursued an independent policy in the various wars of the early 4th century BC. After the Macedonian conquest of Greece, the Acrocorinth was the seat of a Macedonian garrison until 243 BC, when the city joined the Achaean League.

=== Ancient Rome ===
Nearly a century later, in 146 BC, Corinth was captured and was completely destroyed by the Roman army.

As a newly rebuilt Roman colony in 44 BC, Corinth flourished and became the administrative capital of the Roman province of Achaea.

=== Medieval times ===
An important earthquake touched Corinth and its region in 856, causing around 45000 deaths.

=== Modern era ===
In 1858, the old city, now known as Ancient Corinth (Αρχαία Κόρινθος, &quot;Archaia Korinthos&quot;), located southwest of the modern city, was totally destroyed by a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. New Corinth (&quot;Nea Korinthos&quot;) was then built to the north-east of it, on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth. In 1928, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake devastated the new city, which was then rebuilt on the same site. In 1933, there was a great fire, and the new city was rebuilt again.

During the German occupation in World War II, the Germans operated a Dulag transit camp for British, Australian, New Zealander and Serbian prisoners of war and a forced labour camp in the town.

==Geography==
Located about west of Athens, Corinth is surrounded by the coastal townlets of (clockwise) Lechaio, Isthmia, Kechries, and the inland townlets of Examilia and the archaeological site and village of ancient Corinth. Natural features around the city include the narrow coastal plain of Vocha, the Corinthian Gulf, the Isthmus of Corinth cut by its canal, the Saronic Gulf, the Oneia Mountains, and the monolithic rock of Acrocorinth, where the medieval acropolis was built.

===Climate===
According to the nearby weather station of Velo, operated by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, Corinth has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The hottest month is July with an average temperature of while the coldest month is January with an average temperature of . Corinth receives about 463 mm of rainfall per year and has an average annual temperature of .

== Demographics ==

The Municipality of Corinth (Δήμος Κορινθίων) had a population of 55,941 according to the 2021 census, the second most populous municipality in the Peloponnese Region after Kalamata. The municipal unit of Corinth had 38,485 inhabitants, of which Corinth itself had 30,816 inhabitants, placing it in second place behind Kalamata among the cities of the Peloponnese Region.
The municipal unit of Corinth (Δημοτική ενότητα Κορινθίων) includes apart from Corinth proper the town of Archaia Korinthos, the town of Examilia, and the smaller settlements of Xylokeriza and Solomos. The municipal unit has an area of 102.187 km2.

==Economy==
=== Industry ===
Corinth is a major industrial hub at a national level. The Corinth Refinery is one of the largest oil refining industrial complexes in Europe. Ceramic tiles, copper cables, gums, gypsum, leather, marble, meat products, medical equipment, mineral water and beverages, petroleum products, and salt are produced nearby. , a period of Economic changes commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility diminished their operations.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===
Corinth is a major road hub. The A7 toll motorway for Tripoli and Kalamata, (and Sparta via the A71 toll), branches off the A8/E94 toll motorway from Athens at Corinth. Corinth is the main entry point to the Peloponnesian peninsula, the southernmost area of continental Greece.

=== Bus ===
KTEL Korinthias provides intercity bus service in the peninsula and to Athens via the Isthmos station southeast of the city center. Local bus service is also available.

=== Railways ===
The metre gauge railway from Athens and Pireaeus reached Corinth in 1884. This station closed to regular public transport in 2007. In 2005, two years prior, the city was connected to the Athens Suburban Railway, following the completion of the new Corinth railway station. The journey time from Athens to Corinth is about 55 minutes. The train station is 5 minutes by car from the city centre and parking is available for free.

=== Port ===
The port of Corinth, located north of the city centre and close to the northwest entrance of the Corinth Canal, at 37 56.0’ N / 22 56.0’ E, serves the local needs of industry and agriculture. It is mainly a cargo exporting facility.

It is an artificial harbour (depth approximately , protected by a concrete mole (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds.

Within the port operates a customs office facility and a Hellenic Coast Guard post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marble, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, bulk carriers and ROROs, in case of strikes at Piraeus port.

==== Ferries ====
There was formerly a ferry link to Catania, Sicily and Genoa in Italy.

=== Canal ===
The Corinth Canal, carrying ship traffic between the western Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, is about east of the city, cutting through the Isthmus of Corinth that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is in length and only wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.

The canal was mooted in ancient times and an abortive effort was made to dig it in around 600 BC by Periander which led him to pave the Diolkos highway instead. Julius Caesar and Caligula both considered digging the canal but died before starting the construction. The emperor Nero then directed the project, which consisted initially of a workforce of 6,000 Jewish prisoners of war, but it was interrupted because of his death. The project resumed only in 1882, after Greece gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was finally completed in 1893, but due to the canal&#x27;s narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.

== Sport ==
The city&#x27;s association football team is Korinthos F.C. (&quot;Π.Α.E. Κόρινθος&quot;), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (&quot;Παγκορινθιακός&quot;) and Corinth Football Club (&quot;Κόρινθος&quot;). During the 2006–2007 season, the team played in the Greek Fourth Division&#x27;s Regional Group 7. The team went undefeated that season and it earned the top spot. This granted the team a promotion to the Gamma Ethnikí (Third Division) for the 2007–2008 season. For the 2008–2009 season, Korinthos F.C. competed in the Gamma Ethniki (Third Division) southern grouping.

<text>Colossae (; ) was an ancient city of Phrygia in Asia Minor, and one of the most celebrated cities of southern Anatolia (modern Turkey). The Epistle to the Colossians, an early Christian text which identifies its author as Paul the Apostle, is addressed to the church in Colossae. A significant city from the 5th century BC onwards, it had dwindled in importance by the time of Paul, but was notable for the existence of its local angel cult. It was part of the Roman and Byzantine province of Phrygia Pacatiana, before being destroyed in 1192/3 and its population relocating to nearby Chonae (Chonai, modern-day Honaz).

==Location and geography==

Colossae was located in Phrygia, in Asia Minor. It was located southeast of Laodicea on the road through the Lycus Valley near the Lycus River at the foot of Mt. Cadmus, the highest mountain in Turkey&#x27;s western Aegean Region, and between the cities Sardeis and Celaenae, and southeast of the ancient city of Hierapolis. At Colossae, Herodotus describes how, &quot;the river Lycos falls into an opening of the earth and disappears from view, and then after an interval of about five furlongs it comes up to view again, and this river also flows into the Maiander.&quot; Despite a treacherously ambiguous cartography and history, Colossae has been clearly distinguished in modern research from nearby &quot;Chonai&quot; (), now called Honaz, with what remains of the buried ruins of Colossae (&quot;the mound&quot;) lying to the north of Honaz.

==Origin and etymology of place name==

The medieval poet Manuel Philes incorrectly imagined that the name &quot;Colossae&quot; was connected to the Colossus of Rhodes. More recently, in an interpretation that ties Colossae to an Indo-European root that happens to be shared with the word &quot;kolossos&quot;, Jean-Pierre Vernant has connected the name to the idea of setting up a sacred space or shrine. Another proposal relates the name to the Greek &quot;kolazo&quot; &#x27;to punish&#x27;. Others believe the name derives from the manufacture of its famous dyed wool, or &quot;colossinus&quot;.

==History==
===Before the Pauline period===

The first mention of the city may be in a 17th-century BC Hittite inscription, which speaks of a city called Huwalušija, which some archeologists believe is a reference to early Colossae. The 5th-century geographer Herodotus first mentions Colossae by name and as a &quot;great city in Phrygia&quot;, which accommodates the Persian king Xerxes I while en route to wage war against the Greeks in the Greco-Persian Wars– showing the city had already reached a certain level of wealth and size by this time. 
Writing in the 5th century BC, Xenophon refers to Colossae as &quot;a populous city, wealthy and of considerable magnitude&quot;. It was famous for its wool trade. Strabo notes that the city drew great revenue from the flocks, and that the wool of Colossae gave its name to colour &quot;colossinus&quot;.

In 396 BC, Colossae was the site of the execution of the rebellious Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who was lured there and slain by an agent of the party of Cyrus the Younger.

===Pauline period===

Although during the Hellenistic period, the town was of some mercantile importance, by the 1st century it had dwindled greatly in size and significance. Paul&#x27;s letter to the Colossians points to the existence of an early Christian community. Colossae was home to the miracle near the Archangel church, where a sacristan named Archipos witnessed, how the Archangel Michael thwarted a plan by the heathens to destroy the church by flooding it with the waters of near-by mountain rivers. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates this feast on 6(19) September.
The canonical biblical text Epistle to the Colossians is addressed to the Christian community in Colossae. The epistle has traditionally been attributed to Paul the Apostle due to its autobiographical salutation and style, but some modern critical scholars now believe it to be written by another author some time after Paul&#x27;s death. It is believed that one aim of the letter was to address the challenges that the Colossian community faced in its context of the syncretistic Gnostic religions that were developing in Asia Minor.

According to the Epistle to the Colossians, Epaphras seems to have been a person of some importance in the Christian community in Colossae, and tradition presents him as its first bishop. The epistle also seems to imply that Paul had never visited the city, because it only speaks of him having &quot;heard&quot; of the Colossians&#x27; faith, and in the Epistle to Philemon Paul tells Philemon of his hope to visit Colossae upon being freed from prison. Tradition also gives Philemon as the second bishop of the see.

The city was decimated by an earthquake in the 60s AD, and was rebuilt independent of the support of Rome.

The Apostolic Constitutions list Philemon as a bishop of Colossae. On the other hand, the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; considers Philemon doubtful.

The first historically documented bishop is Epiphanius, who was not personally at the Council of Chalcedon, but whose metropolitan bishop Nunechius of Laodicea, the capital of the Roman province of Phrygia Pacatiana, signed the acts on his behalf.

===Byzantine period and decline===

The city&#x27;s fame and renowned status continued into the Byzantine period, and in 858, it was distinguished as a Metropolitan See. The Byzantines also built the church of St. Michael in the vicinity of Colossae, one of the largest church buildings in the Middle East. Nevertheless, sources suggest that the town may have decreased in size or may even been completely abandoned due to Arab invasions in the seventh and eighth centuries, forcing the population to flee to resettle in the nearby city of Chonai (modern day Honaz).

Colossae&#x27;s famous church was destroyed in 1192/3 during the Byzantine civil wars. It was a suffragan diocese of Laodicea in Phyrigia Pacatiana but was replaced in the Byzantine period by the Chonae settlement on higher ground.

===Modern study and archeology===

Most archeological attention has been focused on nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis. Excavations of Colossae began in 2021 led by Bariş Yener of Pammukale University in Denizli. The first several years involve surface surveys to analyze pottery and survey the landscape. They hope to start digging in 2023-24.

The site exhibits a biconical acropolis almost high, and encompasses an area of almost . On the eastern slope there sits a theater which probably seated around 5,000 people, suggesting a total population of 25,000–30,000 people. The theater was probably built during the Roman period, and may be near an agora that abuts the &quot;cardo maximus&quot;, or the city&#x27;s main north–south road. Ceramic finds around the theater confirm the city&#x27;s early occupation in the third and second millennia BC. Northeast of the tell, and most likely outside the city walls, a necropolis displays Hellenistic tombs with two main styles of burial: one with an antecedent room connected to an inner chamber, and tumuli, or underground chambers accessed by stairs leading to the entrance. Outside the tell, there are also remains of sections of columns that may have marked a processional way, or the &quot;cardo&quot;. Today, the remains of one column marks the location where locals believe a church once stood, possibly that of St. Michael. Near the Lycus River, there is evidence that water channels had been cut out of the rock with a complex of pipes and sluice gates to divert water for bathing and for agricultural and industrial purposes.

===Modern legacy===
The holiness and healing properties associated with the waters of Colossae during the Byzantine era continue to this day, particularly at a pool fed by the Lycus River at the Göz picnic grounds west of Colossae at the foot of Mt. Cadmus. Locals consider the water to be therapeutic.

<doc id="6848" wikidata="Q2630753" url="?curid=6848" title="Charge of the Goddess">
<text>The Charge of the Goddess (or Charge of the Star Goddess) is an inspirational text often used in the neopagan religion of Wicca. The Charge of the Goddess is recited during most rituals in which the Wiccan priest/priestess is expected to represent, and/or embody, the Goddess within the sacred circle, and is often spoken by the High Priest/Priestess after the ritual of Drawing Down the Moon.

The Charge is the promise of the Goddess (who is embodied by the high priestess) to all witches that she will teach and guide them. It has been called &quot;perhaps the most important single theological document in the neo-Pagan movement&quot;. It is used not only in Wicca, but as part of the foundational documents of the Reclaiming tradition of witchcraft co-founded by Starhawk.

Several versions of the Charge exist, though they all have the same basic premise, that of a set of instructions given by the Great Goddess to her worshippers. The earliest version is that compiled by Gerald Gardner. This version, titled &quot;Leviter Veslis&quot; or &quot;Lift Up the Veil&quot;, includes material paraphrased from works by Aleister Crowley, primarily from Liber AL (The Book of the Law, particularly from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess), and from Liber LXV (The Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent) and from Crowley&#x27;s essay &quot;The Law of Liberty&quot;, thus linking modern Wicca to the cosmology and revelations of Thelema. It has been shown that Gerald Gardner&#x27;s book collection included a copy of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Equinox&quot; (1919) which includes all of the Crowley quotations transferred by Gardner to the Charge of the Goddess.

There are also two versions written by Doreen Valiente in the mid-1950s, after her 1953 Wiccan initiation. The first was a poetic paraphrase which eliminated almost all the material derived from Leland and Crowley. The second was a prose version which is contained within the traditional Gardnerian Book of Shadows and more closely resembles Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Leviter Veslis&quot; version of 1949.

Several different versions of a Wiccan Charge of the God have since been created to mirror and accompany the Charge of the Goddess.

== Themes ==

The opening paragraph names a collection of goddesses, some derived from Greek or Roman mythology, others from Celtic or Arthurian legends, affirming a belief that these various figures represent a single Great Mother:
This theme echoes the ancient Roman belief that the Goddess Isis was known by ten thousand names and also that the Goddess still worshipped today by Wiccans and other neopagans is known under many guises but is in fact one universal divinity.

The second paragraph is largely derived and paraphrased from the words that Aradia, the messianic daughter of Diana, speaks to her followers in Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1899 book &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; (London: David Nutt; various reprints). The third paragraph is largely written by Doreen Valiente, with a significant content of phrases loosely from &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; and &quot;The Book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent&quot; by Aleister Crowley.

The charge affirms that &quot;all&quot; acts of love and pleasure are sacred to the Goddess, e.g.:

== History ==
=== Ancient precedents ===
In book eleven, chapter 47 of Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, Isis delivers what Ceisiwr Serith calls &quot;essentially a charge of a goddess&quot;. This is rather different from the modern version known in Wicca, though they have the same premise, that of the rules given by a great Mother Goddess to her faithful.

The Charge of the Goddess is also known under the title &quot;Leviter Veslis&quot;. This has been identified by the historian Ronald Hutton, cited in an article by Roger Dearnsley &quot;The Influence of Aleister Crowley on &quot;Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical&quot;, as a piece of medieval ecclesiastical Latin used to mean &quot;lifting the veil.&quot; However, Hutton&#x27;s interpretation does not reflect the Latin grammar as it currently stands. It may represent Gardner&#x27;s attempt to write &quot;Levetur Velis&quot;, which has the literal meaning of &quot;Let the veil be lifted.&quot; This expression would, by coincidence or design, grammatically echo the famous &quot;fiat lux&quot; (&quot;Gen. 1:3&quot;) of the Latin Vulgate.

===Origins===
The earliest known Wiccan version is found in a document dating from the late 1940s, Gerald Gardner&#x27;s ritual notebook titled &quot;Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical&quot;. The oldest identifiable source contained in this version is the final line, which is traceable to the 17th-century &quot;Centrum Naturae Concentratum&quot; of Alipili (or Ali Puli). This version also draws extensively from Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; (1899) and other modern sources, particularly from the works of Aleister Crowley.

It is believed to have been compiled by Gerald Gardner or possibly another member of the New Forest coven. Gardner intended his version to be a theological statement justifying the Gardnerian sequence of initiations. Like the Charge found in Freemasonry, where the charge is a set of instructions read to a candidate standing in a temple, the Charge of the Goddess was intended to be read immediately before an initiation.

Valiente felt that the influence of Crowley on the Charge was too obvious, and she did not want &quot;the Craft&quot; (a common term for Wicca) associated with Crowley. Gardner invited her to rewrite the Charge. She proceeded to do so, her first version being into verse.

The initial verse version by Doreen Valiente consisted of eight verses, the second of which was:

Valiente was unhappy with this version, saying that &quot;people seemed to have some difficulty with this, because of the various goddess-names which they found hard to pronounce&quot;, and so she rewrote it as a prose version, much of which differs from her initial version, and is more akin to Gardner&#x27;s version. This prose version has since been modified and reproduced widely by other authors.

<text>Denton True &quot;Cy&quot; Young (March 29, 1867 – November 4, 1955) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Born in Gilmore, Ohio, he worked on his family&#x27;s farm as a youth before starting his professional baseball career. Young entered the major leagues in 1890 with the National League&#x27;s Cleveland Spiders and pitched for them until 1898. He was then transferred to the St. Louis Cardinals franchise. In 1901, Young jumped to the American League and played for the Boston Red Sox franchise until 1908, helping them win the 1903 World Series. He finished his career with the Cleveland Naps and Boston Rustlers, retiring in 1911.

Young was one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game early in his career. After his speed diminished, he relied more on his control and remained effective into his forties. By the time Young retired, he had established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. He holds MLB records for the most career wins, with 511, along with most career losses, earned runs, hits allowed, innings pitched, games started, batters faced, and complete games. He led his league in wins during five seasons and pitched three no-hitters, including a perfect game in 1904.

In 1937, Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He is often regarded as one of the greatest pitchers of all time, as well as a pioneer of modern pitching. In 1956, one year after his death, the Cy Young Award was created to annually honor the best pitcher in the Major Leagues (later each League) of the previous season, cementing his name as synonymous with excellence in pitching.

==Early life==
Cy Young was the oldest child born to Nancy (Mottmiller) and McKinzie Young Jr., and was christened Denton True Young. He was of part German descent. The couple had four more children: Jesse Carlton, Alonzo, Ella, and Anthony. When the couple married, McKinzie&#x27;s father gave him the of farm land he owned. Young was born in Gilmore, a tiny farming community located in Washington Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years. Young was also known as &quot;Farmer Young&quot; and &quot;Farmboy Young&quot;. Young stopped his formal education after he completed the sixth grade so he could help out on the family&#x27;s farm. In 1885, Young moved with his father to Nebraska, and in the summer of 1887, they returned to Gilmore.

Young played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth, including a semi-professional Carrollton team in 1888. Young pitched and played second base. The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season. In that game, Young played first base and had three hits in three at-bats. After the season, Young received an offer to play for the minor league Canton team, which started Young&#x27;s professional career.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Young began his professional career in 1890 with the Canton, Ohio based Canton Nadjys, team of the Tri-State League, a professional minor league. During his tryout, Young impressed the scouts, recalling years later, &quot;I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball.&quot; Cy Young&#x27;s nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball. The fences looked like a cyclone had hit them. Reporters later shortened the name to &quot;Cy&quot;, which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life. During his one year with Canton, he was 15-15.

Franchises in the National League, the major professional baseball league at the time, wanted the best players available to them. Therefore, in 1890, Young signed with the Cleveland Spiders, a team that had moved from the American Association to the National League the previous year.

===Cleveland Spiders (1890–1898)===
On August 6, 1890, Young&#x27;s major league debut, he pitched a three-hit 8–1 victory over the Chicago Colts. While Young was with the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a baseball statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history. Early on, Young established himself as one of the harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young&#x27;s fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On the last day of the season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young&#x27;s career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young&#x27;s ability. Anson told Spiders manager Gus Schmelz, &quot;He&#x27;s too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He&#x27;s not worth it now, but I&#x27;m willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him.&quot; Schmelz replied, &quot;Cap, you can keep your thousand and we&#x27;ll keep the rube.&quot;
Two years after Young&#x27;s debut, the National League moved the pitcher&#x27;s position back by . Since 1881, pitchers had pitched within a &quot;box&quot; whose front line was from home base, and since 1887 they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball. The back line was away from home. In 1893, was added to the back line, yielding the modern pitching distance of . In the book &quot;The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers&quot;, sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young, Amos Rusie, and Jouett Meekin threw was the impetus that caused the move.

The 1892 regular season was a success for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first half and the Spiders won the second-half, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders&#x27; second-half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games: he lost two and one ended in a scoreless tie.

The Spiders faced the Baltimore Orioles in the Temple Cup, a precursor to the World Series, in 1895. Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup, four games to one. It was around this time that Young added what he called a &quot;slow ball&quot; to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm. The pitch today is called a changeup. In 1896, Young lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said that, despite his teammate&#x27;s gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.

===St. Louis Perfectos / Cardinals (1899–1900)===
Prior to the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs simultaneously. The Browns were renamed the &quot;Perfectos&quot;, and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Young, Jesse Burkett, and Bobby Wallace. The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. Meanwhile, the depleted Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. Young spent two years with St. Louis, which is where he found his favorite catcher, Lou Criger. The two men were teammates for a decade.

===Boston Americans / Red Sox (1901–1908)===

In 1901, the rival American League declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League&#x27;s Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In his first year in the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team&#x27;s games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team&#x27;s 79 wins. In February 1902, before the start of the baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.

The Boston Americans played the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first modern World Series in 1903. Young, who started Game One against the visiting Pirates, thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history. The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning, and Young lost the game. Young performed better in subsequent games, winning his next two starts. He also drove in three runs in Game Five. Young finished the series with a 2–1 record and a 1.85 ERA in four appearances, and Boston defeated Pittsburgh, five games to three.

After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston&#x27;s ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, &quot;How do you like that, you hayseed?&quot;

Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young&#x27;s perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after he allowed a hit, Young&#x27;s scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings.

Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher&#x27;s box was only from home base (the modern release point is about farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young&#x27;s perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 4–2, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: &quot;For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in.&quot; In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.

In 1908, Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, he was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old Nolan Ryan broke it. Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game. After that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. At the time, Young was the second-oldest player in either league. In another game one month before his no-hitter, he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters. On August 13, 1908, the league celebrated &quot;Cy Young Day&quot;. No American League games were played on that day, and a group of All-Stars from the league&#x27;s other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox. When the season ended, he posted a 1.26 ERA, which gave him not only the lowest in his career, but also a major league record of being the oldest pitcher with 150+ innings and an ERA under 1.50.

===Cleveland Naps (1909–1911)===
Young was traded back to Cleveland, the place where he played over half his career, before the 1909 season, to the Cleveland Naps of the American League. The following season, 1910, he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington.

===Boston Rustlers (1911) and retirement===
He split 1911, his final year, between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers. On September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates, 1–0, for his last career victory. In his final start two weeks later, the last eight batters of Young&#x27;s career combined to hit a triple, four singles, and three doubles. By the time of his retirement, Young&#x27;s control had faltered. He had also gained weight. In two of his last three years, he was the oldest player in the league.

===Career accomplishments===
Young established numerous pitching records, some of which have stood for over a century. Young compiled 511 wins, which is the most in major league history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson, second on the list. At the time of Young&#x27;s retirement, Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364. In addition to wins, Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched (7,356), most career games started (815), and most complete games (749). He also retired with 316 losses, the most in MLB history. Young&#x27;s career record for strikeouts was broken by Johnson in 1921. Young&#x27;s 76 career shutouts are fourth all-time.
Young led his league in wins five times (1892, 1895, and 1901–1903), finishing second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He won at least 30 games in a season five times. He had 15 seasons with 20 or more wins, two more than Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young&#x27;s earned run average was below 2.00 six times, but it was not uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (140 in 1896 and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings fourteen times and finished second once. Only twice in his 22-year career did he finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young&#x27;s death, he was retroactively league leader seven times and was second or third another seven times.

Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher: they each won 192 games while with the franchise. In addition, Young pitched three no-hitters, including the third perfect game in baseball history, first in baseball&#x27;s &quot;modern era&quot;. Young also was an above average hitting pitcher. He posted a .210 batting average (623-for-2960) with 325 runs, 290 RBIs, 18 home runs, and 81 walks. From 1891 through 1905, he drove in 10 or more runs for 15 straight seasons, with a high of 28 in 1896.

==Pitching style==
Particularly after his fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. He was once quoted as saying, &quot;Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control.&quot; In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury, owing partly to his ability to pitch in different arm positions (overhand, three-quarters, sidearm and even submarine). For 19 consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his league&#x27;s top 10 for innings pitched; in 14 of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. &quot;I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it,&quot; said Young, &quot;and there wasn&#x27;t any use wasting them.&quot; He once described his approach before a game:
I never warmed up ten, fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do. I&#x27;d loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I&#x27;d relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I&#x27;d take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That&#x27;s why I was able to work every other day.

==Managerial record==
* Stepped down to a player only role.

==Later life==

In 1910, it was reported that Young became a vegetarian, after baseball and working on his farm. In 1913, he served as manager of the Cleveland Green Sox of the Federal League, which was at the time an outlaw league. However, he never worked in baseball after that.

Young was a Freemason.

In 1916, he ran for county treasurer in Tuscarawas County, Ohio.

Young&#x27;s wife, Roba, whom he had known since childhood, died in 1933. After she died, Young tried several jobs, and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them. Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement. In 1937, 26 years after he retired from baseball, Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall.

By 1940, Young&#x27;s only source of income was stock dividends of $300 per year ($ today). He appeared on the television show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; on April 13, 1955. On November 4, 1955, Young died on the Benedums&#x27; farm at the age of 88. He was buried in Peoli, Ohio.

==Legacy==

Young&#x27;s career is seen as a bridge from baseball&#x27;s earliest days to its modern era; he pitched against stars such as Cap Anson, already an established player when the National League was first formed in 1876, as well as against Eddie Collins, who played until 1930. When Young&#x27;s career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher&#x27;s mound was not moved back to its present position of until Young&#x27;s fourth season; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season.

Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1956, about one year after Young&#x27;s death, the Cy Young Award was created to honor the best pitcher in Major League Baseball for each season. The first award was given to Brooklyn&#x27;s Don Newcombe. Originally, it was a single award covering all of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.

On September 23, 1993, a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by Northeastern University on the site of the Red Sox&#x27;s original stadium, the Huntington Avenue Grounds. It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series, as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball. A home plate-shaped plaque next to the statue reads:

On October 1, 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims (later known as the Red Sox) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site. General admission tickets were fifty cents. The Pilgrims, led by twenty-eight game winner Cy Young, trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three.
In 1999, 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Young 14th on their list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. That same year, baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

<doc id="6851" wikidata="Q945030" url="?curid=6851" title="Coronation Street">
<text>Coronation Street (colloquially referred to as Corrie) is a British television soap opera created by Granada Television and shown on ITV since 9 December 1960. The programme centres on a cobbled, terraced street in the fictional town of Weatherfield in Greater Manchester. The location was itself based on Salford, the hometown of the show&#x27;s first screenwriter and creator, Tony Warren.

Originally broadcast twice weekly, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; increased its runtime in later years, currently airing three 60-minute episodes per week. Warren developed the concept for the series, which was initially rejected by Granada&#x27;s founder Sidney Bernstein. Producer Harry Elton convinced Bernstein to commission 13 pilot episodes. The show has since become a significant part of British culture and underpinned the success of its producing Granada franchise.

Currently produced by ITV Studios, the successor to Granada, the series is filmed at MediaCityUK and broadcast across all ITV regions, as well as internationally. In 2010, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s longest-running television soap opera upon its 50th anniversary.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; was originally influenced by kitchen-sink realism and is known for portraying a working-class community with a blend of humour and strong, relatable characters. As of 2019, it averages approximately five million viewers per episode. The series aired its 10,000th episode on 7 February 2020 and marked its 60th anniversary later that year.

==History==
===1960s===
The first episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; aired on 9 December 1960 at 7 pm. It initially received mixed reviews; &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; columnist Ken Irwin predicted the series would last only three weeks. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; also printed: &quot;The programme is doomed from the outset ... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.&quot; Granada Television had commissioned 13 episodes, with some inside the company doubting the show would last beyond its planned production run. However, viewers quickly connected with the programme&#x27;s portrayal of relatable, everyday characters. The programme also made use of Northern English language and dialect; affectionate local terms like &quot;eh, chuck?&quot;, &quot;nowt&quot; (, from &quot;nought&quot;, meaning &quot;nothing&quot;), and &quot;by &#x27;eck!&quot; became widely heard on British television for the first time.

Early storylines included student Ken Barlow (William Roache), whose university education set him apart from his working-class family, including his brother David (Alan Rothwell) and parents Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida (Noel Dyson). Barlow&#x27;s character offered commentary on broader social changes, including globalisation, as exemplified by his 1961 line: &quot;You can&#x27;t go on just thinking about your own street these days. We&#x27;re living with people on the other side of the world.&quot; Roache remains the only original cast member and holds the record as the longest-serving actor in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and global soap opera history.

In March 1961, the show reached number one in the television ratings and remained there for the rest of the year. Earlier that year, a television audience measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (approximately 15 million people) watched the programme. By 1964, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; attracted over 20 million regular viewers, the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36 million viewers. 

In 1964, Tim Aspinall became the series producer and implemented significant changes to the programme. Nine cast members were fired, the first being Lynne Carol, who had played Martha Longhurst since early in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#x27;s run. Carol’s firing caused controversy, prompting her co-star Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) to threaten to quit, although she ultimately remained. The sacking was widely covered in the media, and Carol was mobbed by fans while out in public. Some, including &quot;Coronation Street&quot; writer H.V. Kershaw, criticised the decision as a bid to boost ratings.

By 1968, critics contended that the programme offered a nostalgic and outdated depiction of the urban working class, failing to reflect the contemporary realities of British society amid the decade&#x27;s economic and social changes. Granada considered modernising the show with issue-driven plots, including Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) becoming addicted to drugs, Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) being in a storyline about homosexuality, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family. However, these ideas were abandoned due to concerns about viewer reactions. 

The first episode filmed in color was broadcast on 3 November 1969. Since then, all episodes have been produced in color, with the exception of those created during the Colour Strike.

===1970s===
Several main cast members departed &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in the early 1970s. In 1970, Arthur Leslie, who played Jack Walker, the landlord of the Rovers Return Inn, died suddenly, and his character was written out shortly thereafter. Anne Reid left the series in 1971, with her character, Valerie Barlow, dying due to accidental electrocution from a faulty hairdryer. In 1973, Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner, departed, and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took a two-month leave of absence. During this period, ITV&#x27;s other flagship soap opera, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, experienced an increase in viewership, while &quot;Coronation Street&quot; saw a decline in ratings.

The departure of these cast members in the early 1970s prompted the writing team to expand the roles of supporting characters and introduce new ones. Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride) was introduced in 1972 and became a regular character in 1973. Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), who had become a regular character in 1970, became increasingly prominent as the decade progressed. Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox), who had made a single appearance in 1964, returned and joined the regular cast in 1972. Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow) became a regular character in 1973. Ivy Tyldesley (Lynne Perrie, later renamed &quot;Tilsley&quot;) was introduced as a recurring character in 1971. Longtime characters Gail Potter (Helen Worth), Blanche Hunt (initially played by Patricia Cutts and later by Maggie Jones), and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) were introduced in 1974.

Comic storylines, a hallmark of the series in the 1960s, had become less frequent in the early 1970s. They were revived under new producer Bill Podmore, who joined the programme in 1976 after previously working on Granada’s comedy productions.

In September 1977, the &quot;News of the World&quot; quoted actor Stephen Hancock (Ernest Bishop) as saying &quot;The Street kills an actor. I&#x27;m just doing a job, not acting. The scriptwriters have turned me into Ernie Bishop. I&#x27;ve tried to resist it but it is very hard not to play the part all the time, even at home.&quot; Hancock also expressed frustration with the payment system, which guaranteed some long-serving actors—including Pat Phoenix, Doris Speed, and Peter Adamson—payment for every episode regardless of their appearances, while others were compensated only for episodes in which they appeared. Hancock&#x27;s complaints led to a dispute with Podmore, dubbed &quot;The Godfather&quot; by the media, who refused to alter the system. Hancock ultimately resigned.

To write out Ernest Bishop while preserving the role of his wife, Emily (Eileen Derbyshire), the writers decided his character would be fatally shot during a payroll robbery at Mike Baldwin&#x27;s (Johnny Briggs) factory. The episode, which aired on 11 January 1978, marked the first instance of such explicit violence on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, leading to a significant viewer backlash. Granada&#x27;s switchboard was overwhelmed with complaints, and the Lobby Against TV Violence criticised the decision to air the storyline. Granada defended the plot, emphasising its focus on the grief and loss experienced by Emily.

Despite its enduring popularity, critics argued that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; had grown complacent during this period, with the show relying on nostalgic depictions of working-class life rather than addressing contemporary social issues.

===1980s===
Between 1980 and 1984, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; faced the loss of many original cast members. Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) retired in 1980 and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) retired in 1983, Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner) left the programme permanently in 1984. Jack Howarth died in 1984 and his character, Albert Tatlock, was written out off-screen. By May 1984, William Roache (Ken Barlow) was the sole remaining actor from the programme&#x27;s original cast.

Characters like Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers), Vera and Jack Duckworth (Liz Dawn and Bill Tarmey), and Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) took on roles reminiscent of earlier characters. The show introduced its first major black character, Shirley Armitage (Lisa Lewis), as a machinist at Baldwin’s Casuals in 1983.

Established characters were assigned new roles, and new characters were introduced to fill the gaps left by those who departed. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock. The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker&#x27;s 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage (Lisa Lewis) became the first major Black character in the programme.

In 1983, Peter Adamson, who had played Len Fairclough since 1961, was dismissed for breaching his contract. Granada had previously warned Adamson for publishing unauthorised newspaper articles that criticised the show and its cast. Producer Bill Podmore terminated Adamson&#x27;s contract after discovering he had sold his memoirs despite the prior warning. The sacking coincided with allegations of Adamson having indecently assaulted two eight-year-old girls in a swimming pool. Granada Television gave Adamson financial support through his legal problems, with a Crown Court jury finding him not guilty in July 1983. Adamson&#x27;s dispute over his memoirs and newspaper articles was not known to the public and the media reported that Adamson had been dismissed because of the allegations. Len Fairclough was killed off-screen in a motorway crash while returning home from an affair in December 1983. Adamson celebrated the character&#x27;s death by delivering an obituary on TV-am dressed as an undertaker. 

New soap operas began airing on British television in the 1980s, with Channel 4 launching &quot;Brookside&quot; in 1982 and the BBC debuting &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1985. Both soaps presented a grittier, more contemporary view of British life, contrasting with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#x27;s nostalgic tone. &quot;EastEnders&quot; regularly obtained higher viewing figures than &quot;Coronation Street&quot; due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends. Despite this, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; maintained strong ratings.

Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved exterior scenes from being shot on film to videotape in 1988. Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30 pm.

In 1988, Christopher Quinten, who had played Brian Tilsley since 1978, informed Granada of his intention to move to the United States to marry Leeza Gibbons and pursue an acting career in Los Angeles. Quinten sought assurances that his role would remain open for a potential return. However, producers decided that Tilsley would be killed off. Quinten was in Los Angeles when the decision was made and threatened to quit abruptly. Co-star Helen Worth convinced him to film his final scenes. Brian Tilsley&#x27;s death, aired on 15 February 1989, depicted him being fatally stabbed while defending a young woman outside a nightclub. The storyline attracted viewer complaints, with Mary Whitehouse condemning the portrayal of violence.

One of &quot;Coronation Street&#x27;s&quot; most prominent storylines in the 1980s was the engagement and marriage of Ken Barlow and Deirdre Langton (Anne Kirkbride). In July 1981, their wedding was watched by over 15 million viewers – more viewers than ITV&#x27;s coverage of the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer two days later. Deirdre Barlow’s affair with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) in 1983, garnered significant media attention, and began an ongoing feud that followed between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin.

Other notable marriages included Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) to Audrey Potter (Sue Nicholls) in 1985, Mike Baldwin to Ken Barlow&#x27;s daughter Susan (Wendy Jane Walker) in 1986, Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to Sally Seddon (Sally Whittaker) in 1986, Bet Lynch to Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) in 1987, and Ivy Tilsley to Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff) in 1988. The long-awaited marriage of Mavis Riley and Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) occurred in 1988 after over a decade of on-and-off romance and a failed marriage attempt in 1984. 

The psychological abuse of Rita Fairclough by Alan Bradley culminated in his death under a Blackpool tram in December 1989, achieving a combined viewership of 26.93 million for the episodes where Alan went into hiding and later tried to kill Rita.

Jean Alexander, who played Hilda Ogden on the programme starting in 1964, left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1987. Her final aired on Christmas Day 1987 with a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.7 million. Between 1986 and 1989, the storyline of Rita Fairclough&#x27;s (Barbara Knox) domestic abuse at the hands of her partner Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), followed by his death after being struck by a Blackpool tram in December 1989, unfolded. This plotline brought the show its highest-ever combined viewing figure, with nearly 27 million viewers watching a March 1989 episode where Bradley is on the run from the police after attempting to kill Rita. This record is sometimes mistakenly attributed to the tram death episode aired on 8 December 1989.

===1990s===
In 1992, William Rees-Mogg, Chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, criticised &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for its low representation of ethnic minorities and its nostalgic portrayal of a bygone era. This was seen as unreflective of Greater Manchester, where many neighbourhoods had significant Black and Asian populations. Headlines such as &quot;Coronation Street shuts out blacks&quot; (&quot;The Times&quot;) and &quot;&#x27;Put colour in t&#x27;Street&quot; (&quot;Daily Mirror&quot;) reflected the controversy. Patrick Stoddart of &quot;The Times&quot; defended the show, stating: &quot;he millions who watch &quot;Coronation Street&quot; – and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg – know real life when they see it ... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen&quot; While Black and Asian characters had appeared sporadically, the first regular non-white family, the Desai family, was introduced in 1999.

In 1990, new characters Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) and Steph Barnes (Amelia Bullmore) moved to Coronation Street and were labeled yuppies from the media. Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) debuted in 1991 and became one of the era&#x27;s most popular characters, departing in 1996 with a brief return in 2000. The McDonald family–Liz (Beverley Callard), Jim (Charles Lawson), Steve (Simon Gregson), and Andy (Nicholas Cochrane)–were introduced in 1989 and became major characters in the 1990s. Other notable arrivals included Maud Grimes (Elizabeth Bradley), a wheelchair user and pensioner, in 1993; Roy Cropper (David Neilson), a café owner, in 1995; young married couple Gary and Judy Mallett (Ian Mercer and Gaynor Faye) in 1995; and butcher Fred Elliott (John Savident) in 1994 and his son Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) in 1995. The 1990s also saw an increase in slapstick and physical humour, exemplified by comedic characters including Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley), a supermarket manager.

In 1997, Brian Park became producer with a vision to modernise the show and focus on younger characters. On his first day, he axed several long-standing characters, including Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), Bill Webster (Peter Armitage), Billy Williams (Frank Mills) and Maureen Holdsworth (Sherrie Hewson). The decision prompted Thelma Barlow, who played Mavis Wilton, to resign in protest at her co-star&#x27;s dismissal. Several longtime writers, including Barry Hill, Adele Rose, and Julian Roach, resigned during this period.

Park introduced younger characters between 1997 and 1998, such as a recast Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt), single mother Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt), and the problematic Battersby family. The show also began addressing more contemporary issues, including drug dealing, eco-activism, and religious cults. Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), introduced during this era, became the first transgender character in a British soap opera and soon married Roy Cropper. Park, who resigned in 1998, cited this storyline as one of his most significant achievements.

The changes divided audiences, with some alienated by the modernised approach. Critics accused &quot;Coronation Street&quot; of losing its traditional charm while trying to emulate edgier rivals like &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Victor Lewis-Smith wrote in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;: &quot;Apparently it doesn&#x27;t matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.&quot;

One of the decade&#x27;s most famous storylines occurred in 1998, when Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) was wrongfully imprisoned after being deceived by con-man Jon Lindsay (Owen Aaronovitch). The episode depicting her sentencing attracted 19 million viewers and inspired the &quot;Free the Weatherfield One&quot; campaign, which generated significant media attention. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair commented on the fictional case in Parliament. Deirdre was released after three weeks, with Granada confirming that her release had always been planned despite the media frenzy.

===2000s===
On 8 December 2000, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary with a live, hour-long episode. King Charles III (then Prince of Wales) appeared as himself. Earlier that year, 13-year-old Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O&#x27;Brien) became pregnant, giving birth to a daughter, Bethany, on 4 June. The February episode where Gail was told of her daughter&#x27;s pregnancy was watched by 15 million viewers. The programme continued to tackle issue-led storylines, including Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) getting raped, Roy and Hayley Cropper (David Neilson and Julie Hesmondhalgh) abducting their foster child, Sarah Platt’s Internet chat room abduction, and Alma Halliwell&#x27;s (Amanda Barrie) 2001 death from cervical cancer. These storylines proved unpopular with viewers and led to a decline in ratings. As a result, in October 2001, producer Jane Macnaught was reassigned, and Carolyn Reynolds took over. In 2002, Kieran Roberts became producer, aiming to reintroduce &quot;gentle storylines and humour,&quot; steering the show away from competing with other soaps.

In July 2002, Gail Platt married Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), a financial advisor who had left Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die after a fall during an argument, murdered his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion), and later killed their neighbor Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). He also attempted to kill his mother-in-law, Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), and longtime family friend, Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), all for financial gain as his debts mounted. Hillman confessed his crimes to Gail in a two-hander episode in February 2003 before returning weeks later with the intention of killing Gail, her children Sarah and David (Jack P. Shepherd), and granddaughter Bethany by driving them into a canal. While the Platt family survived, Hillman drowned. This storyline received widespread media attention, with viewing figures peaking at 19.4 million. 

Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) became &quot;Corrie&#x27;s&quot; first regular homosexual character. In 2003, another gay male character was introduced, Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). The bigamy of Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and his addiction to alcohol, later in the decade, Maya Sharma&#x27;s (Sasha Behar) revenge on former lover Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), Charlie Stubbs&#x27;s (Bill Ward) psychological abuse of Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay), and the deaths of Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) and Fred Elliott (John Savident). In 2007, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) murdered Charlie Stubbs and claiming it was self-defence; the audience during this storyline peaked at 13.3 million. At the 2007 British Soap Awards, it won Best Storyline, and Ford was voted Best Actress for her portrayal.

In July 2007, after 34 years in the role of Vera Duckworth, Liz Dawn left the show due to ill health. After conversation between Dawn and producers Kieran Roberts and Steve Frost, the decision was made to kill Vera off.

Tina O&#x27;Brien revealed in the British press on 4 April 2007 that she would be leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot; later in the year. Sarah-Louise, who was involved in some of the decade&#x27;s most controversial stories, left in December 2007 with her daughter, Bethany. In 2008, Michelle learning that Ryan (Ben Thompson) was not her biological son, having been accidentally swapped at birth with Alex Neeson (Dario Coates). Carla Connor (Alison King) turned to Liam for comfort and developed feelings for him. In spite of knowing about her feelings, Liam married Maria Sutherland (Samia Longchambon). Maria and Liam&#x27;s baby son was stillborn in April, and during an estrangement from Maria upon the death of their baby, Liam had a one-night stand with Carla, a story which helped pave the way for his departure.

In August 2008, Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope) returned after 42 years. Liam Connor and his ex-sister-in-law Carla gave into their feelings for each other and began an affair. Carla&#x27;s fiancée Tony Gordon (Gray O&#x27;Brien) discovered the affair and had Liam killed in a hit-and-run in October. Carla struggled to come to terms with Liam&#x27;s death, but decided she still loved Tony and married him on 3 December, in an episode attracting 10.3 million viewers. In April 2009 it was revealed that Eileen Grimshaw&#x27;s (Sue Cleaver) father, Colin (Edward de Souza) – the son of Elsie Tanner&#x27;s (Pat Phoenix) cousin Arnley – had slept with Eileen&#x27;s old classmate, Paula Carp (Sharon Duce) while she was still at school, and that Paula&#x27;s daughter Julie (Katy Cavanagh) was in fact also Colin&#x27;s daughter. Other stories in 2009 included Maria giving birth to Liam&#x27;s son and her subsequent relationship with Liam&#x27;s killer Tony, Steve McDonald&#x27;s (Simon Gregson) marriage to Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) and Kevin Webster&#x27;s (Michael Le Vell) affair with Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns). On Christmas Day 2009, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) told husband Kevin that she had breast cancer, just as he was about to leave her for lover Molly.

===2010s===
The show began broadcasting in high-definition in May 2010, and on 17 September that year, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; entered &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s longest-running television soap opera after the American soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; concluded. William Roache was listed as the world&#x27;s longest-running soap actor. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; 50th anniversary week was celebrated with seven episodes, plus a special one-hour live episode, broadcast from 6–10 December. The episodes averaged 14 million viewers, a 52.1% share of the audience. The anniversary was also publicised with ITV specials and news broadcasts. In the storyline, Nick Tilsley and Leanne Battersby&#x27;s bar — The Joinery — exploded during Peter Barlow&#x27;s stag party. As a result, the viaduct was destroyed, sending a Metrolink tram careering onto the street, destroying D&amp;S Alahan&#x27;s Corner Shop and The Kabin. Two characters, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), along with an unknown taxi driver, were killed as a result of the disaster. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) survived, despite being trapped under the rubble of her destroyed shop. Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) prematurely gave birth to a baby girl, Hope. The episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; broadcast on the same day as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; 50th anniversary episode included a tribute, with the character Dot Branning (June Brown, who briefly appeared in the show during the 1970s) saying that she never misses an episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

===2020s===
On 7 February 2020, with its 60th anniversary ten months away, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; aired its landmark 10,000th episode, the runtime of which was extended to 60 minutes. Producers stated that the episode would contain &quot;a nostalgic trip down memory lane&quot; and &quot;a nod to its own past&quot;. A month later, ITV announced that production on the soap would have to be suspended, as the United Kingdom was put into a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television).

After an 11-week intermission for all cast and crew members, filming resumed in June 2020. The episodes featured social distancing to adhere to the guidelines set by the British government, and it was confirmed that all actors over 70, as well as those with underlying health conditions, would not be allowed to be on set until it was safe to do so. This included &quot;Coronation Street&quot; veterans William Roache (Ken Barlow) at 88, Barbara Knox (Rita Tanner) at 87, Malcolm Hebden (Norris Cole) at 80 and Sue Nicholls (Audrey Roberts) at 76. It was deemed safe for Maureen Lipman (Evelyn Plummer) and David Neilson (Roy Cropper) to continue. By December, all cast members had returned to set, and on Wednesday 9 December 2020, the soap celebrated its 60th anniversary, with original plans for the episode forced to change due to COVID-19 guidelines. The anniversary week saw the conclusion of a long-running coercive control storyline that began in May 2019, with Geoff Metcalfe (Ian Bartholomew) abusing Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King). The showdown, which resulted in the death of Geoff allowed social distancing rules to be relaxed on the condition that the crew members involved formed a social bubble prior to the filming. In late 2021, series producer Iain MacLeod announced that the original plans for the 60th anniversary would now take place in a special week of episodes in October 2021.

On 12 October 2021, it was announced that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; would partake in a special crossover event involving 7 British soaps to promote the topic of climate change ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. During the week, beginning from 1 November, social media clips featuring Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) and Amelia Spencer (Daisy Campbell) from &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, as well as Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers) from &quot;Doctors&quot; were featured on the programme, while events from &quot;Holby City&quot; were also referenced. A similar clip featuring Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) was also featured on &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

In June 2024, ITV announced that &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s third longest-serving cast member, Helen Worth, had decided to leave the soap after fifty years of portraying Gail Platt. The character made her departure in December 2024. Following this, several other cast exits began to be confirmed, with a mixture of producers axing the characters and cast members deciding to quit. In what the &quot;Metro&quot; described as a &quot;cast exodus&quot;, these have included Sue Cleaver leaving her long-term role as Eileen Grimshaw and Charlotte Jordan leaving her role as Daisy Midgeley, as well as Debbie Webster (Sue Devaney) and Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) being written out of the series.

==Characters==

Since 1960, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as central figures. These three women remained with the show for at least 20 years, and became archetypes of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street&#x27;s busybody, battle-axe and self-proclaimed moral voice. Elsie was the tart with a heart, who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love. Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return Inn, had delusions of grandeur and saw herself as better than the other residents.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; became known for the portrayal of strong female characters, including original cast characters like Ena, Annie and Elsie, and later Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander), who first appeared in 1964; all four became household names during the 1960s. Warren&#x27;s programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up. Consequently, the show has a long tradition of downtrodden husbands, most famously Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey), husbands of Hilda and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), respectively.

Coronation Street&#x27;s longest-serving character, Ken Barlow (William Roache) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the model Twiggy were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), another character from the first episode, returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show&#x27;s only remaining original character. Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) had appeared in the series since January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show&#x27;s longest-serving female character before she departed in January 2016 after 55 years. Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) appeared on the show for one episode in December 1964, before returning as a full-time cast member in January 1972. She is currently the second longest-serving original cast member on the show. Roache and Knox are also the two oldest-working cast members on the soap at 92 and 91 years-old respectively.

Stan and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda becoming one of the most famous British soap opera characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth-most recognisable woman in Britain, after Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales. Hilda&#x27;s best-known attributes were her pinny, hair curlers, and the &quot;muriel&quot; in her living room with three &quot;flying&quot; duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden&#x27;s departure on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; ever, with nearly 27,000,000 viewers. Stan Ogden had been killed off in 1984 following the death of actor Bernard Youens after a long illness which had restricted his appearances towards the end.

Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous &quot;Corrie&quot; characters. Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as &quot;Queen of the Street&quot; by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002 and November 2003.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current and recent cast based loosely on former characters. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers), Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) has grown snobbish, like Annie, and a number of the programme&#x27;s female characters, such as Carla Connor (Alison King), mirror the vulnerability of Elsie and Bet. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) and Gary Windass (Mikey North), the bumbling retail manager like Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley) and Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig) and Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, Les Battersby (Bruce Jones), Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment).

Villains are also common character types, such as Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), Tony Gordon (Gray O&#x27;Brien), Caz Hammond (Rhea Bailey), Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington), Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden), Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper), Callum Logan (Sean Ward), Karl Munro (John Michie), Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), John Stape (Graeme Hawley), Geoff Metcalfe (Ian Bartholomew) and Gary Windass (Mikey North). The show&#x27;s former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. &quot;Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it&#x27;s because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.&quot;

In 2024, it was reported that the number of actors appearing in each storyline had been cut in order to reduce costs due to declining viewing figures.

==Storylines==
Many topical issues have been tackled on Coronation Street, such as rape, including male and marital, historic sexual abuse, underage pregnancy, transgender issues, the right to die, racism, coercive control, cancer, homosexuality, domestic abuse, child grooming, and suicide, among others.

Key storylines have included: Mike and Deirdre&#x27;s affair (1983), the death of Brian Tilsley (1989), Alan Bradley&#x27;s abuse of Rita (1989), Kevin and Natalie&#x27;s affair (1997), Deirdre’s wrongful imprisonment for fraud (1998), Sarah Platt&#x27;s underage pregnancy (2000), Toyah&#x27;s rape (2001), Alma&#x27;s cancer (2001), Richard Hillman&#x27;s serial killer storyline (2002–2003), Peter Barlow&#x27;s bigamy (2003), Kevin and Molly&#x27;s affair (2009), Kirsty&#x27;s abuse of Tyrone (2012), Hayley&#x27;s cancer (2013), Faye&#x27;s underage pregnancy (2015), Bethany&#x27;s grooming (2017), David&#x27;s rape (2018), Aidan&#x27;s suicide (2018), Sinead&#x27;s diagnosis with cervical cancer (2019), Yasmeen&#x27;s abuse (2020), Daisy&#x27;s stalking hell (2023), Paul&#x27;s MND (2023), Liam&#x27;s bullying and suicidal thoughts (2023), Lauren&#x27;s disappearance and possible murder (2024), and Mason’s death from knife crime (2025).

==Production==
===Broadcast format===

Between 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday. During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15 minutes later. When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday. The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.

The series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This installment featured the street&#x27;s residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.

The ITV network, like BBC1, began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969. Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969. In October 1970, a technicians&#x27; dispute turned into the Colour Strike when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 10 February 1971, although the episodes transmitted on 22 and 24 February 1971 had contained black and white location inserts.

From 22 March 2010, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on ITV HD. The first transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the UK could see them on the ITV site.

On 24 January 2022, ITV announced that as part of an overhaul of their evening programming, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; would permanently air as three 60-minute episodes per week from March 2022 onwards. This is set to change again in 2026. It was confirmed that half an hour of content would be dropped from the schedule. Another change was the timeslot, with the soap instead set to air every weekday at 8:30pm for 30 minutes. ITV&#x27;s Managing Director of Media and Entertainment Kevin Lygo explained: &quot;research insights show us that soap viewers are increasingly looking to the soaps for their pacey storytelling. Streaming-friendly, 30 minute episodes better provide the opportunity to meet viewer expectations for storyline pace, pay-off and resolution.&quot;

===Production staff===

&quot;Coronation Street&#x27;s&quot; creator, Tony Warren, wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976. He later became a novelist, but retained links with &quot;Coronation Street.&quot; Warren died in 2016.

Harry Kershaw was the script editor for &quot;Coronation Street&quot; when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show&#x27;s producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Adele Rose was &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#x27;s first female writer and the show&#x27;s longest-serving writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created &quot;Byker Grove&quot;. Rose also won a BAFTA award in 1993 for her work on the show.

Bill Podmore was the show&#x27;s longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the &quot;godfather&quot; by the tabloid press, he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is known for sacking Peter Adamson, the show&#x27;s Len Fairclough, in 1983. Iain MacLeod is the current series producer.

Michael Apted, known for the &quot;Up!&quot; series of documentaries, was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer Jack Rosenthal. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as &quot;Bar Mitzvah Boy&quot;, began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969. Paul Abbott was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce &quot;Cracker&quot;, for which he later wrote, before creating his own dramas such as &quot;Touching Evil&quot; and &quot;Shameless&quot;. Russell T Davies was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s, also writing the script for the direct-to-video special &quot;Viva Las Vegas!&quot; He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; and the 2005 revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Jimmy McGovern also wrote some episodes.

===Theme music===
The show&#x27;s theme music, a cornet piece, accompanied by a brass band plus clarinet and double bass, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by Eric Spear. The original theme tune was called &quot;Lancashire Blues&quot; and Spear was paid a £6 commission in 1960 to write it.

The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, &quot;an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one.&quot; In 2004, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning had played the original version. However, after investigating further, his story was found to be false, Browning not knowing that the original trumpet player Ronnie Hunt was still alive, proving that he was the true and rightful player that performed the solo. With his union pay stubs and contract, Browning was proven false.

A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the original when the series started broadcasting in HD on 31 May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield. A reggae version of the theme tune was recorded by The I-Royals and released by Media Marvels and WEA in 1983.

===Viewing figures===
Episodes in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, regularly attracted figures of between 18 and 21 million viewers, and during the 1990s and early 2000s, 14 to 16 million per episode would be typical. Like most terrestrial television in the UK, a decline in viewership has taken place and the show posts an average audience of just under 9 million per episode , remaining one of the highest rated programmes in the UK. &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; have often competed for the highest rated show.

The episode that aired on 2 January 1985, in which Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) finds out she has got the job as manager of the Rovers Return, is the highest-rated single episode in the show&#x27;s history, attracting 21.40 million viewers. The 25 December 1987 episode, where Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) leaves the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long-term employer Dr Lowther, attracted a combined audience of 26.65 million for its original airing and omnibus repeat on 27 December 1987. This is the second-highest combined rating in the show&#x27;s history. The show attracted its highest-ever combined rating of 26.93 million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) is in hospital and Alan Bradley (Mark Eden) is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode.

By the 2020s viewing figures dropped due to increased competition from streaming services and satellite channels, with the usually high-rated Christmas episode being viewed by only 2.6 million households in 2023, down from 2.8 million in 2022 and 8 million a decade previously. However, these figures are based on overnight ratings and do not include viewing via ITV&#x27;s &quot;catch-up&quot; streaming service.

===Sets===

The regular exterior buildings shown in Coronation Street include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (The Kabin), a café (Roy&#x27;s Rolls), a general grocery shop (D&amp;S Alahan&#x27;s), a factory (Underworld) and Rovers Return Inn public house. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show&#x27;s characters.

Between 1960 and 1968, street scenes were transmitted/taped before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood. In 1968 Granada built an outside set not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site. When the show began broadcasting in colour, these were replaced with brick façades, and back yards were added in the 1970s.

In 1982, a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada backlot, an area between Quay Street and Liverpool Road in Manchester. The set was constructed from reclaimed Salford brick. The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.

Between 1989 and 1999, the Granada Studios Tour allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the Rosamund Street and Victoria Street façades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. Most interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.

In 2008, Victoria Court, an apartment building full of luxury flats, was started on Victoria Street.

In 2014, production moved to a new site at Trafford Wharf, a former dock area about two miles to the east, part of the MediaCityUK complex. The Trafford Wharf backlot is built upon a former truck stop site next to the Imperial War Museum North. It took two years from start to finish to recreate the iconic Street. The houses were built to almost full scale after previously being three-quarter size. On 5 April 2014, the staff began to allow booked public visits to the old Quay Street set. An advert, with a voiceover from Victoria Wood, appeared on TV to advertise the tour. The tour was discontinued in December 2015.

On 12 March 2018, the extension of the Victoria Street set was officially unveiled. The new set featured a garden, featuring a memorial bench paying tribute to the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, including &quot;Coronation Street&quot; &quot;super fan&quot; Martyn Hett. The precinct includes a Greater Manchester Police station called Weatherfield Police station. As part of a product placement deal between three companies and ITV Studios, new additions include a tram stop station which is named Weatherfield North with Transport for Greater Manchester Metrolink branding, while shop front facades of Costa Coffee and the Weatherfield branded Co-op Food store interior scenes have been screened. Exterior scenes at the new set first aired on 20 April 2018.

On 20 April 2018, ITV announced that they had been granted official approval of planning permission to allow booked public visits to the MediaCityUK Trafford Wharf set. Tours commenced on weekends from 26 May 2018 onwards. The set was further expanded in March 2022, with the addition of the Weatherfield Precinct, which took six months to build, and was inspired by Salford. The new section of the set included a two-storey construction featuring maisonettes, a staircase and balcony leading to the properties, a piazza and an array of shops and units.

==Broadcast==
===United Kingdom===
For 60 years, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has remained at the centre of ITV&#x27;s prime time schedule. The programme is currently shown in the UK in three hour-long episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV in the 8 pm time slot - Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Additional episodes have been broadcast at other times, such as between 22 and 26 November 2004, when eight episodes were shown including three 10pm outings. These late night episodes allowed for more graphic content when ‘Mad’ Maya (Maya Sharma) sought her revenge on Dev Alahan and Sunita Alahan.

From Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast on Wednesday and Friday at 7 pm. Schedules were changed, and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 7:30 pm. A third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 7:30 pm. From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 7:30 pm on Sunday nights.

Aside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: Anglia Television, Associated-Rediffusion, Television Wales and the West, Scottish Television, Southern Television and Ulster Television. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, Tyne Tees Television broadcast the programme. That left ATV in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 7 pm to Monday and Wednesday at 7:30 pm and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.

As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: Westward Television from episode 40 on 1 May 1961, Border Television from episode 76 on 4 September 1961, Grampian Television from episode 84 on 2 October 1961, Channel Television from episode 180 on 3 September 1962 and Teledu Cymru (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 17 September 1962. At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 7:30 pm on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-eight years.

From episode 2981 on Friday 20 October 1989 at 7:30 pm, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from episode 4096 on Sunday 24 November 1996, again at 7:30 pm. A second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 8:30 pm to usher in the return of Bet Lynch. The Monday 8:30 pm episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman storyline and became a regular feature from episode 5568 on Monday 25 August 2003.

In January 2008, ITV axed the Sunday episode, and instead aired a second episode on Fridays, at 8:30 pm, with the final Sunday episode airing on 6 January 2008, though some episodes thereafter continued to air occasionally on Sundays, usually for when an episode was displaced from one of its regular slots by a live football match. From 23 July 2009 to September 2012 the Wednesday show was replaced with an episode at 8:30 pm on Thursdays. A sixth weekly episode was added on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm from 20 September 2017.

In March 2020, it was revealed that episodes that were currently filming for future broadcast (as episodes are filmed a few weeks in advance) during the COVID-19 pandemic would be shown differently. Instead of six episodes a week, only three episodes would be broadcast, airing as normal on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the normal timeslot of 7:30 pm. The actions provided would be made effective starting from 30 March. Simultaneously, the announcement also mentioned that the elderly cast of the show would be &quot;written off&quot; due to health advice issued by Public Health England and the NHS. On 22 March, ITV released a statement confirming that filming of both &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was suspended.

In June 2020, ITV announced that filming would resume on 9 June. However, due to the new health and safety measures, cast members over the age of 70 or with underlying health conditions did not come back on set, until the production could determine it is safe for them to return.

In July 2020, ITV announced that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; would return to the normal output of six episodes a week in September that year.

In October 2020, Maureen Lipman and David Neilson made their first appearances since July that year, as all cast members over the age of 70 had temporarily left the series earlier in the year. William Roache, Barbara Knox and Sue Nicholls returned in December.

On 22 January 2021, ITV announced that filming would be suspended from 25 January in order to rewrite &quot;stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic&quot; and to &quot;review all health and safety requirements&quot;. ITV also confirmed that this decision would not affect their ability to deliver six episodes a week.

In January 2022, it was announced that after 60 years in the 7.30 pm slot, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s transmission time would move to 8pm due to the &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; having a longer duration, pushing &quot;Emmerdale&quot; into the 7.30 pm slot on weeknights. The double-bill episodes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays have merged into hour-long slots on these days. The new scheduling went live on Monday 7 March 2022.

====Repeats and classic episodes====
Repeat episodes, omnibus broadcasts and specials have been shown on various ITV channels. After several years on ITV2, in January 2008 the omnibus returned to the main ITV channel, where it was aired on Saturday mornings or afternoons, depending on the schedule and times.

In May 2008, it moved to Sunday mornings, until August 2008, when it returned to Saturdays. In January 2009, it moved back to Sunday mornings, usually broadcasting at around 9.25am until December 2010. In January 2011, the omnibus moved to Saturday mornings on ITV at 9.25am. During the Rugby World Cup, which took place in New Zealand, matches had to be broadcast on a Saturday morning, so the omnibus moved to Saturday lunchtimes/afternoons during September and October 2011. On 22 October 2011, the omnibus moved back to Saturday mornings at 9.25am on ITV. In January 2012, the omnibus moved to ITV2, and then moved to ITV3 in January 2020. In January 2022, the omnibus moved back to ITV2.

Older episodes were broadcast by satellite and cable channel Granada Plus from its launch in 1996. The first episodes shown were from episode 1588 (originally transmitted on Monday 5 April 1976) onwards. Originally listed and promoted as &quot;Classic Coronation Street&quot;, the &quot;classic&quot; was dropped in early 2002, at which stage the episodes were from late 1989. By the time of the channel&#x27;s closure in 2004, the repeats had reached February 1994.

In addition to this, &quot;specials&quot; were broadcast on Saturday afternoons in the early years of the channel, with several episodes based on a particular theme or character(s) shown. The last episode shown in these specials was from 1991. In addition, on 27 and 28 December 2003, several Christmas Day editions of the show were broadcast.

ITV3 began airing afternoon timeslot sequential reruns of &quot;Classic Coronation Street&quot; from 2 October 2017. Two classic episodes were retransmitted from Mondays to Fridays at 2:40 pm until 3:45 pm, starting from episode 2587 (originally transmitted on Wednesday 15 January 1986) onwards.

To mark the 60th anniversary of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, between 7 and 11 December 2020 at 10:00 pm–11:05 pm, ITV3 aired special episodes of the soap including &quot;Episode 1&quot;, the tenth anniversary episode from December 1970, two episodes from the twentieth anniversary in December 1980, two episodes from the thirtieth anniversary in December 1990, the &quot;2000 live episode&quot; from the fortieth anniversary in December 2000, and the &quot;fiftieth anniversary episode&quot; which aired after a repeat of &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;.

On Easter Monday 2022, to commemorate the upcoming 90th birthday of William Roache, eight special &quot;Coronation Street&quot; Ken Barlow episodes were aired on 18 April 2022, at 10:25 am–2:35 pm. The episodes shown were &quot;Episode 1&quot; from December 1960, &quot;Ken and Deirdre Tie the Knot&quot; from July 1981, &quot;Ken&#x27;s Affair&quot; from December 1989, &quot;Deirdre&#x27;s Fling&quot; from January 2003, &quot;Steve and Karen&#x27;s Wedding Shocker&quot; from February 2004, &quot;Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s Second Wedding&quot; from April 2005, &quot;Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s Holiday&quot; from August 2014, and&quot; Deirdre&#x27;s Death&quot; from July 2015.

===International broadcast===
&quot;Coronation Street&quot; is shown in various countries worldwide. YouTube has the first episode and many others available as reruns.

The programme was first aired in Australia in 1963 on TCN-9 Sydney, GTV-9 Melbourne and NWS-9 Adelaide, and by 1966 &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was more popular in Australia than in the UK. The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia. It briefly returned to the Nine Network in a daytime slot during 1994–1995. In 2005, STW-9 Perth began to show episodes before the 6 pm news to improve the lead in to Nine News Perth, but this did not work and the show was cancelled a few months later. In 1996, pay-TV began and Arena began screening the series in one-hour instalments on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:30 pm EST. The series was later moved to pay-TV channel UKTV (now BBC UKTV), where it is still shown. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is shown Mon-Thu at 7:20 pm EST and a double episode on Fridays, with episodes on the channel being one week behind UK broadcast.

In Canada, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is broadcast on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, beginning in the fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order to catch up with the ITV showings, at 6:30 pm and 7 pm local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30 pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto&#x27;s CBLT in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus. In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to prime time. In light of austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, according to the CBC&#x27;s director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: &quot;Unofficially I can tell you &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is coming back. If it didn&#x27;t come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill.&quot; Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC&#x27;s English-language division, once remarked: &quot;&quot;Coronation Street&quot; fans are the most loyal, except maybe for curling viewers, of all CBC viewers.&quot; As of mid 2022, Canada is about three weeks behind the UK and airs six episodes per week.

In Ireland, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is currently shown on Virgin Media One. The show was first aired in 1978, when RTÉ2 began showing episodes from 1976, although Ireland caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. In 1992 it moved to RTÉ One, but in 2001 Granada TV bought 45 percent of TV3, and so TV3 broadcast the series from 2001 to 2014. In 2006, ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3 continued to buy the soap until the end of 2014 when it moved to UTV Ireland. Coronation Street has broadcast on each of the main Irish networks, except for the Irish language network TG4. In December 2016, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; returned to TV3 (now Virgin Media One). The show is consistently the channel&#x27;s most viewed programme every week.

Two Dutch stations have broadcast &quot;Coronation Street&quot;: VARA showed 428 episodes between 1967 and 1975, and SBS6 ran the show for a period starting in 2010. From 2006 the series was also broadcast by Vitaya, a small Flemish Belgian channel.

In New Zealand, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has been shown locally since 1964, first on NZBC television until 1975, and then on TV One, which broadcasts it in a 4-episode/2-hour block on Fridays from 7:30 pm. In September 2014, TV One added a 2-episode/1-hour block on Saturday from 8:30 pm. Because TV One did not upgrade to showing the equivalent of five or six episodes per week, New Zealand continued to fall further and further behind with episodes, and was 23 months behind Britain as of March 2014. During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 7:30 pm slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights, The serial aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 pm until October 2011, when the show moved to a 5:30 pm half-hour slot every weekday. The move proved unpopular with fans, and the series was quickly moved into its present prime-time slot within weeks. Episodes 7883, 7884, 7885 and 7886 were screened on 16 May 2014. These were originally aired in the UK between 4 and 11 June 2012. On 10 May 2018 it was announced that the current 2016 episodes would be moved to 1 p.m. Monday-Friday titled &#x27;Catch-up Episodes&#x27; and for primetime Wednesday-Friday express episodes would be airing in New Zealand a week behind the United Kingdom titled &#x27;2018 Episodes&#x27; these changes would be taking place from 11 June 2018.

In South Africa, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; episodes were broadcast three days after the UK air date on ITV Choice until the channel ceased broadcasting in June 2020, episodes temporarily went off the air until they moved to M-Net City, starting in October 2020.

In the United States, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is available by broadcast or cable only in northern markets where CBC coverage from Canada overlaps the border or is available on local cable systems. It was broadcast on CBC&#x27;s US cable channel, Trio until the CBC sold its stake in the channel to Universal, before it was shut down in 2006. Beginning in 2009, episodes were available in the United States through Amazon.com&#x27;s on-demand service, a month behind their original UK airdates. The final series of shows available from Amazon appears to be from November 2012, as no new episodes have been uploaded. On 15 January 2013, online distributor Hulu began airing episodes of the show, posting a new episode daily, two weeks after their original airdates. For a time, Hulu&#x27;s website stated: &quot;New episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; will be unavailable as of April 7th, 2016&quot;, with the same being said for British soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, but Hulu is once again showing new episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as of April 2017, two weeks behind the UK airdate. The BBC/ITV service Britbox shows new episodes on the same day as the UK airing. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was also shown on USA Network for an unknown period starting in 1982.

HM Forces and their families stationed overseas can watch &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on ITV, carried by the British Forces Broadcasting Service, which is also available to civilians in the Falkland Islands. It used to be shown on BFBS1.

Satellite channel ITV Choice showed the programme in Asia, Middle East, Cyprus, and Malta, before the channel ceased broadcasting in 2019.

==Merchandise==
&quot;The Street&quot;, a magazine dedicated to the show, was launched in 1989. Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially A5 size, expanding to A4 from the seventh issue. The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher&#x27;s contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.

On 25 June 2010, a video game of the show was released on Nintendo DS. The game was developed by Mindscape, and allowed players to complete tasks in the fictitious town of Weatherfield.

===Discography===
In 1995, to commemorate the programme&#x27;s 35th anniversary, a CD titled &quot;The Coronation Street Album&quot; was released, featuring cover versions of modern songs and standards by contemporary cast members.

The album charted a Top 40 hit when &quot;The Coronation Street Single&quot; (a double a-side featuring a cover of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; by Bill Waddington – with various cast members on backing vocals – on one side and &quot;Something Stupid&quot; by Johnny Briggs &amp; Amanda Barrie on the other) reached number 35 in the Official UK charts.

In 2010, an album featuring songs sung by cast members was released to celebrate 50 years of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The album is titled &quot;Rogues, Angels, Heroes &amp; Fools&quot;, and was later developed into a musical.

==Spin-offs==
===Television===
Granada launched one spin-off in 1965, &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;, following the story of clothing store manager Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) after he left Weatherfield. Swindley&#x27;s management experience was tested when he was appointed assistant manager at a fictional department store, Dobson and Hawks. Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.

In 1967, Arthur Lowe returned as Leonard Swindley in &quot;Turn Out the Lights&quot;, a short-lived sequel to &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;. It ran for just one series of six episodes before it was cancelled.

In 1972, Neville Buswell and Graham Haberfield starred as Ray Langton and Jerry Booth in a pilot for a potential spin-off series called &quot;Rest Assured&quot;. Written and produced by H.V. Kershaw the pilot had an episode title of &quot;Lift Off&quot;, and featured Fred Feast (later cast as Fred Gee in Coronation Street) as the lift engineer. No series was commissioned.

From 1985 to 1988, Granada TV produced a sitcom called &quot;The Brothers McGregor&quot; featuring a pair of half-brothers (one black, one white) who had appeared in a single episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as old friends of Eddie Yeats and guests at his wedding. The original actors were unavailable so the characters were recast with Paul Barber and Philip Whitchurch. The show ran for 26 episodes over four series.

In 1985, a sister series, &quot;Albion Market&quot;, was launched. It ran for one year, with 100 episodes produced.

====Crossovers====
In 2010, several actors from the show appeared on &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot; as their soap characters: David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey). In the fictional, semi-improvised scenario, David accused Nick (his brother) and Tina (his ex-girlfriend) of sleeping together.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; and rival soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; had a crossover for &quot;Children in Need&quot; in November 2010 called &quot;East Street&quot;. &quot;EastEnders&quot; stars that visited Weatherfield include Laurie Brett as Jane Beale, Charlie G. Hawkins as Darren Miller, Kylie Babbington as Jodie Gold, Nina Wadia as Zainab Masood and John Partridge as Christian Clarke.

On 21 December 2012, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; produced a Text Santa special entitled &quot;A Christmas Corrie&quot; which featured Norris Cole in the style of Scrooge, being visited by the ghosts of dead characters. The ghosts were Mike Baldwin, Maxine Peacock, Derek Wilton and Vera Duckworth. Other special guests include Torvill and Dean, Lorraine Kelly and Sheila Reid. The episode concluded with Norris learning the error of his ways and dancing on the cobbles. The original plan for this feature was to have included Jack Duckworth, along with Vera, but actor Bill Tarmey died before filming commenced. In the end a recording of his voice was played.

====Documentaries====
&quot;Coronation Street: Family Album&quot; was several documentaries about various families living on the street.

&quot;Farewell ...&quot; was several documentaries featuring the best moments of a single character who had recently left the series—most notably, Farewell Mike (Baldwin), Farewell Vera (Duckworth), Farewell Blanche (Hunt), Farewell Jack (Duckworth), Farewell Janice (Battersby), Farewell Liz (McDonald), Farewell Becky (McDonald), and Farewell Tina (McIntyre). Most of these were broadcast on the same day as the character&#x27;s final scenes in the series.

&quot;Stars on the Street&quot; was aired around Christmas 2009. It featured actors from the soap talking about the famous guest stars who had appeared in the series including people who were in it before they were famous.

In December 2010, ITV made a few special programmes to mark the 50th anniversary. &quot;Coronation Street Uncovered: Live&quot;, hosted by Stephen Mulhern was shown after the episode with the tram crash was aired on ITV2. On 7 and 9 December, a countdown on the greatest Corrie moments, &quot;Coronation Street: 50 Years, 50 Moments&quot;, the viewers voted &quot;The Barlows at Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; as the greatest moment. On 10 December Paul O&#x27;Grady hosted a quiz show, &quot;Coronation Street: The Big 50&quot; with three teams from the soap and a celebrity team answering questions about Coronation Street and other soaps. Also, &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot; aired Coronation Street specials in the anniversary week.

====International adaptation====
The German TV series &quot;Lindenstraße&quot; took &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as the model. &quot;Lindenstraße&quot; started in 1985 and broadcast its final episode on 29 March 2020, after airing for nearly 35 years.

===Films===
Over the years, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has released several straight-to-video films. Unlike other soaps, which often used straight-to-video films to cover more contentious plot lines that may not be allowed by the broadcaster, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has largely used these films to reset their characters in other locations.

In 1995, &quot;Coronation Street: The Cruise&quot; also known as &quot;Coronation Street: The Feature Length Special&quot; was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show, featuring Rita Sullivan, Mavis Wilton, Alec Gilroy, Curly Watts and Raquel Watts. ITV heavily promoted the programme as a direct-to-video exclusive, but broadcast a brief version of it on 24 March 1996. The Independent Television Commission investigated the broadcast, as viewers complained that ITV misled them.

In 1997, following the controversial cruise spin-off, &quot;Coronation Street: Viva Las Vegas!&quot; was released on VHS, featuring Vera Duckworth, Jack Duckworth, Fiona Middleton and Maxine Peacock on a trip to Las Vegas, which included the temporary return of Ray Langton.

In 1999, six special episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; were produced, following the story of Steve McDonald and Vikram Desai in Brighton, which included the temporary returns of Bet Gilroy, Reg Holdsworth and Vicky McDonald. This video was titled &quot;Coronation Street: Open All Hours&quot; and released on VHS.

In 2008, ITV announced filming was to get underway for a new special DVD episode, &quot;Coronation Street: Out of Africa&quot;, featuring Kirk Sutherland, Fiz Brown, Chesney Brown, which included the temporary return of Cilla Battersby-Brown. Sophie Webster, Becky Granger and Tina McIntyre also make brief appearances.

In 2009, another DVD special, &quot;Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday&quot;, was released. The feature-length comedy drama followed Roy, Hayley and Becky as they travelled to Romania for the wedding of a face from their past. Eddie Windass also briefly appears.

The BBC commissioned a one-off drama called &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, about how the series first came into being. Jessie Wallace plays Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner) with Lynda Baron as Violet Carson (Ena Sharples), Celia Imrie as Doris Speed (Annie Walker) and James Roache as his own father William Roache (Ken Barlow). It was broadcast on 16 September 2010 on BBC Four.

On 1 November 2010, &quot;Coronation Street: A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; was released. Reg Holdsworth and Curly Watts returned in the film. Mary tries to take Norris to an apparently haunted castle where she hoped to seduce him. Rosie gets a job there and she takes Jason with her. Brian Capron also guest starred as an assumed relative of Richard Hillman. He rises out of a lake with a comedic &quot;wink to the audience&quot; after Hillman drowned in 2003. Rita Sullivan also briefly appears.

===Online===
On 21 December 2008, a web-based miniseries ran on ITV.com; called &quot;Corrie Confidential&quot;; the first episode featured the characters Rosie and Sophie Webster in &quot;Underworld&quot;.

ITV.com launched a small spin-off drama series called &#x27;Gary&#x27;s Army Diaries&#x27; which revolves around Gary Windass&#x27;s experiences in Afghanistan and the loss of his best friend, Quinny. Due to their popularity, the three five-minute episodes were recut into a single 30-minute episode, which was broadcast on ITV2.

William Roache and Anne Kirkbride starred as Ken and Deirdre in a series of ten three-minute internet &#x27;webisodes&#x27;. The first episode of the series titled, &quot;Ken and Deirdre&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot; was activated on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011.

In 2011, an internet based spin-off starring Helen Flanagan as Rosie Webster followed her on her quest to be a supermodel called &quot;Just Rosie&quot;.

On 3 February 2014, another web-based miniseries ran on ITV.com; called &quot;Streetcar Stories&quot;. It showed what Steve and Lloyd get up to during the late nights in their Streetcar cab office. The first episode shows Steve and Lloyd making a cup of tea with &quot;The Stripper&quot; playing in the background, referencing Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s Breakfast Sketch. The second episode involves the pair having a biscuit dunking competition.

During the &#x27;Who Attacked Ken&#x27; storyline, a mini series of police files was run on the official Coronation Street YouTube channel. They outlined the suspects&#x27; details and possible motives.

===Stage===

In August 2010, many &quot;Coronation Street&quot; characters were brought to the stage in Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s comedy play &quot;Corrie!&quot;. The play was commissioned to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the TV series and was presented at The Lowry in Salford, England by ITV Studios and Phil McIntyre Entertainments. Featuring a cast of six actors who alternate roles of favourite characters including Ena Sharples, Hilda Ogden, Hayley and Roy, Richard Hillman, Jack and Vera, Bet Lynch, Steve, Karen and Becky, the play weaves together some of the most memorable moments from the TV show. It toured UK theatres between February 2011 and July 2011 with guest star narrators including Roy Barraclough, Ken Morley and Gaynor Faye.

==In popular culture==
The British rock band Queen produced a single &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; in 1984 that reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is memorable for its music video in which the band members dressed in women&#x27;s clothing, which parodied characters in Coronation Street and is considered an homage to the show. The video depicts Freddie Mercury as a housewife, loosely based on Bet Lynch, who wants to &quot;break free&quot; from his life. Although Lynch was a blonde in the soap opera, Mercury thought he would look too silly as a blonde and chose a dark wig. Guitarist Brian May plays another, more relaxed housewife based on Hilda Ogden.
In December 2022, the American singer Bob Dylan was offered a cameo on Coronation Street after revealing to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that he is a fan of the ITV soap.

==Sponsorship==
Cadbury was the first sponsor of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, beginning in July 1996. In the summer of 2006, Cadbury Trebor Bassetts had to recall over one million chocolate bars, due to suspected salmonella contamination, and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; stopped the sponsorship for several months. In 2006, Cadbury did not renew their contract, but agreed to sponsor the show until &quot;Coronation Street&quot; found a new sponsor.

Harveys then sponsored &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from 30 September 2007 until December 2012. In the &quot;Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday&quot; film, Roy and Hayley Cropper are filmed in front of a Harveys store, and in &quot;Coronation Street: A Knights Tale&quot;, a Harveys truck can be seen driving past Mary Taylor&#x27;s motorhome. Compare The Market took over as sponsor from 26 November 2012 until 30 November 2020. On 10 December 2020, it was announced that Argos would be the new sponsor of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, starting on 1 January 2021.

In November 2011, a Nationwide Building Society ATM in Dev Alahan&#x27;s corner shop became the first use of paid-for product placement in a UK primetime show. In 2018, the shop fronts of Co-Op and Costa Coffee were added to the sets, along with characters using shopping bags with the respective logos on as props.

Hyundai have been the sponsor since January 2015 in the Republic of Ireland, aired on Virgin Media One.

<text>Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (31 August 12 – 24 January 41), better known by his nickname Caligula (), was Roman emperor from AD 37 until his assassination in AD 41. He was the son of the Roman general Germanicus and Augustus&#x27; granddaughter Agrippina the Elder, members of the first ruling family of the Roman Empire. He was born two years before Tiberius was made emperor. Gaius accompanied his father, mother and siblings on campaign in Germania, at little more than four or five years old. He had been named after Gaius Julius Caesar, but his father&#x27;s soldiers affectionately nicknamed him &quot;Caligula&quot; (&#x27;little boot&#x27;).

Germanicus died in Antioch in 19, and Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Emperor Tiberius, who was Germanicus&#x27; biological uncle and adoptive father. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. In 26, Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri, and in 31, Caligula joined him there. Tiberius died in 37 and Caligula succeeded him as emperor, at the age of 24.

Of the few surviving sources about Caligula and his four-year reign, most were written by members of the nobility and senate, long after the events they purport to describe. For the early part of his reign, he is said to have been &quot;good, generous, fair and community-spirited&quot; but increasingly self-indulgent, cruel, sadistic, extravagant and sexually perverted thereafter; an insane, murderous tyrant who demanded and received worship as a living god, humiliated his Senate, and planned to make his horse a consul. Most modern commentaries seek to explain Caligula&#x27;s position, personality and historical context. Some historians dismiss many of the allegations against him as misunderstandings, exaggeration, mockery or malicious fantasy.

During his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and public works to benefit Rome&#x27;s ordinary citizens, including racetracks, theatres, amphitheatres, and improvements to roads and ports. He began the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province. He had to abandon an attempted invasion of Britain, and the installation of his statue in the Temple of Jerusalem. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. At least some of the conspirators might have planned this as an opportunity to restore the Roman Republic and aristocratic privileges, but if so, their plan was thwarted by the Praetorians, who seem to have spontaneously chosen Caligula&#x27;s uncle Claudius as the next emperor. Caligula&#x27;s death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line, though the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule until the demise of Caligula&#x27;s nephew, the Emperor Nero.

== Early life ==


Caligula was born in Antium on 31 August AD 12, the third of six surviving children of Germanicus and his wife and second cousin, Agrippina the Elder. Germanicus was a grandson of Mark Antony, and Agrippina was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, making her the granddaughter of Augustus. The future emperor Claudius was Caligula&#x27;s paternal uncle. Caligula had two older brothers, Nero and Drusus, and three younger sisters, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla. At the age of two or three, he accompanied his father, Germanicus, on campaigns in the north of Germania. He wore a miniature soldier&#x27;s outfit devised by his mother to please the troops, including army boots (&quot;caligae&quot;) and armour. The soldiers nicknamed him &quot;Caligula&quot; (&quot;little boot&quot;). Winterling believes he would have enjoyed the attention of the soldiers, to whom he was something of a mascot, though he later grew to dislike the nickname.

Germanicus was a respected, immensely popular figure among his troops and Roman civilians of every class, and was widely expected to eventually succeed his uncle Tiberius as emperor. For his successful northern campaigns, he was awarded the great honour of a triumph. During the triumphal procession through Rome, Caligula and his siblings shared their father&#x27;s chariot, and the applause of the populace. A few months later, Germanicus was despatched to tour Rome&#x27;s allies and provinces with his family. They were received with great honour; at Assos Caligula gave a public speech, aged only 6. Somewhere &quot;en route&quot;, Germanicus contracted what proved to be a fatal illness. He lingered awhile, and died at Antioch, Syria, in AD 19, aged 33, convinced that he had been poisoned by the provincial governor, Gnaius Calpurnius Piso. Many believed that he had been killed at the behest of Tiberius, as a potential rival.

Germanicus was cremated, and his ashes were taken to Rome, escorted by his wife and children, Pretorian guards, civilian mourners and senators, then placed in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Caligula lived with his mother Agrippina in Rome, in a milieu very different from that of his earlier years. Agrippina made no secret of her imperial ambitions for herself and her sons, and in consequence, her relations with Tiberius rapidly deteriorated. Tiberius believed himself under constant threat from treason, conspiracy and political rivalry. He forbade Agrippina to remarry, for fear that a remarriage would serve her personal ambition, and introduce yet another threat to himself. The last years of his principate were dominated by treason trials, whose outcomes were determined by senatorial vote. Agrippina, and Caligula&#x27;s brother Nero, were tried and banished in the year 29 on charges of treason. The adolescent Caligula was sent to live with his great-grandmother (Tiberius&#x27; mother), Livia. After her death two years later, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia Minor. In the year 30, Tiberius had Caligula&#x27;s brothers, Drusus and Nero, declared public enemies by the Senate, and exiled. Caligula and his three sisters remained in Italy as hostages of Tiberius, kept under close watch.

== Capri ==

In 31, Caligula&#x27;s brother Nero died in exile. Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius at Villa Jovis on Capri. 

He was befriended by Tiberius&#x27; Praetorian prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro. Macro had been active in the downfall of Sejanus, his ambitious and manipulative predecessor in office, and was a trusted communicant between the emperor, and his senate in Rome. Philo, Jewish diplomat and later witness to several events in Caligula&#x27;s court, writes that Macro protected and supported Caligula, allaying any suspicions Tiberius might harbour concerning his young ward&#x27;s ambitions. Macro represented Caligula to Tiberius as &quot;friendly, obedient&quot; and devoted to Tiberius&#x27; grandson, Tiberius Gemellus, who was seven years younger than himself. Caligula is described during this time as a first-rate orator, well-informed, cultured and intelligent, a natural actor who recognized the danger he was in, and hid his resentment of Tiberius&#x27; maltreatment of himself and his family behind such an obsequious manner that it was said of him that there had never been &quot;a better slave or a worse master&quot;. Caligula&#x27;s failure to protest the destruction of his family is taken by Tacitus as evidence that his &quot;monstrous character was masked by a hypocritical modesty&quot;. Winterling observes that a forthright protest would &quot;certainly have cost him his life&quot;.

In 33, Caligula&#x27;s mother and his brother Drusus died, while still in exile. In the same year, Tiberius arranged the marriage of Caligula and Junia Claudilla, daughter of one of Tiberius&#x27; most influential allies in the Senate, Marcus Junius Silanus. Caligula was given an honorary quaestorship in the &quot;&quot;, a series of political promotions that could lead to consulship. He would hold this very junior senatorial post until his sudden nomination as emperor. Junia died in childbirth the following year, along with her baby. In 35, Tiberius named Caligula as joint heir with Tiberius&#x27; grandson, Gemellus, who was Caligula&#x27;s junior by seven years and not yet an adult. At the time, Tiberius seemed to be in good health, and likely to survive until Gemellus&#x27; majority.

In Philo&#x27;s account, Tiberius was genuinely fond of Gemellus, but doubted his personal capacity to rule and feared for his safety should Caligula come to power. Suetonius claims that Tiberius, ever mistrustful but still shrewd in his mid-70s, saw through Caligula&#x27;s apparent self-possession to an underlying &quot;erratic and unreliable&quot; temperament, not one to be trusted in government; and he claims that Caligula took pleasure in cruelty, torture, and sexual vice of every kind. Tiberius is said to have indulged the young man&#x27;s appetite for theatre, dance and singing, in the hope that this would help soften his otherwise savage nature; &quot;he used to say now and then that to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.&quot; Winterling points out that this judgment draws on later, not particularly accurate accounts of Caligula&#x27;s rule; Suetonius credits Tiberius with a knowledge of human nature which in reality was not only foreign to him, but famously unsound. At Capri, Caligula learned to dissimulate. He probably owed his life to that and, as all the ancient sources agree, to Macro. Many believed, or claimed to believe, that given a little more time, Tiberius would have eliminated Caligula as a possible successor, but died before this could be done.

== Emperor ==
=== Early reign ===

Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, a day before the Liberalia festival. He was 77 years old. Suetonius, Tacitus and Cassius Dio repeat variously elaborated rumours which held that Caligula, perhaps with Macro, was directly responsible for his death. Philo and Josephus, the latter a Romano-Jewish writer who served Vespasian a generation later, describe Tiberius&#x27; death as natural. On the same day, Caligula was hailed as emperor by members of the Praetorian guard at Misenum. His leadership of the &quot;domus Caesaris&quot; (&quot;Caesar&#x27;s household&quot;) as its sole heir and pater familias was ratified by the senate, who acclaimed him &quot;imperator&quot; two days after the death of Tiberius. Caligula entered Rome on 28 or 29 March, and with the consensus of &quot;the three orders&quot; (senate, equestrians and common citizens) the Senate conferred on him the &quot;right and power to decide on all affairs&quot;.

====&quot;Princeps&quot;====
In a single day, and with a single piece of legislation, the 25-year-old Caligula, previously a virtual unknown in Rome&#x27;s political life, and with no military service, was thus granted the same trappings, authority and powers that Augustus had accumulated piecemeal, over a lifetime and sometimes reluctantly. Until his first formal meeting with the Senate, Caligula refrained from using the titles they had granted him. His studied deference must have gone some way to reassure the more astute that he should prove amenable to their guidance. Some must have resented the political manipulations that led to this extraordinary settlement. Caligula was now entitled to make, break or ignore any laws he chose. Augustus had shown, and Tiberius had failed to realise, that the roles of &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;) and &quot;princeps legibus solutus&quot; (&quot;a princeps not bound by the laws&quot;) required the exercise of personal responsibility, self-restraint, and above all, tact; as if the Senate still held the power they had voluntarily surrendered. In the words of scholar Anthony A. Barrett, &quot;Caligula would be restrained only by his own sense of discretion, which became in lamentably short supply as his reign progressed&quot;.

Caligula dutifully asked the Senate to approve divine honours for his predecessor but was turned down, in line with senatorial and popular opinion regarding the dead emperor&#x27;s worth. Caligula did not push the issue; he had made the necessary gesture of filial respect. Tiberius&#x27; will named two heirs, Caligula and Gemellus, but the latter was still a minor, and could not hold any kind of office. The will was annulled with the standard justification that Tiberius must have been insane when he composed it, incapable of good judgment. Although Tiberius&#x27; will had been legally set aside, Caligula honoured many of its terms, and in some cases, improved on them. Tiberius had provided each praetorian guardsman with a generous gratitude payment of 500 sesterces. Caligula doubled this, and took credit for its payment as an act of personal generosity; he also paid bonuses to the city troops and the army outside Italy. Every citizen in Rome was given 150 sesterces, and heads of households twice that amount. Building projects on the Palatine hill and elsewhere were also announced, which would have been the largest of these expenditures.

Thanks to Macro&#x27;s preparations on his behalf, Caligula&#x27;s accession was a &quot;brilliantly stage-managed affair&quot;. The legions had already sworn loyalty to Caligula as their imperator. Now Caligula gave the miserly Tiberius a magnificent funeral at public expense, and a tearful eulogy, and met with an ecstatic popular reception along the funeral route and in Rome itself. Among Caligula&#x27;s first acts as emperor was the provision of public games on a grand scale. Philo describes Caligula in these early days as universally admired. Suetonius writes that Caligula was loved by many, for being the beloved son of the popular Germanicus. Three months of public rejoicing ushered in the new reign. Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula&#x27;s reign as a &quot;Golden Age&quot; of happiness and prosperity. Josephus claims that in the first two years of his reign, Caligula&#x27;s &quot;high-minded... even-handed&quot; rule earned him goodwill throughout the Empire.

Caligula took up his first consulship on 1 July, two months after his succession. He accepted all titles and honours offered him except &quot;pater patriae&quot; (&quot;father of the fatherland&quot;), which had been conferred on Augustus. Caligula refused it, protesting his youth, until 21 September 37. He commemorated his own father, Germanicus, with portraits on coinage, adopted his name, and renamed the month of September after him. He granted his sisters and his grandmother Antonia Minor extraordinary privileges, normally reserved for the Vestals, and female priesthoods of the deified Augustus; their powers were entirely ceremonial, not executive, but their names were included in the standard formulas used in the senate house to invoke divine blessings on debates and proceedings, and the annual prayers for the safety of emperor and state. Caligula named his favourite sister, Drusilla, as heir to his &quot;imperium&quot;. Oaths were sworn in the name of Caligula, and his entire family. One of his sesterces not only identifies each sister by name, but associates her with a particular imperial virtue; &quot;security&quot;, &quot;concord&quot; or &quot;fortune&quot;. Caligula ordered that an image of his deceased mother, Agrippina, must accompany all festival processions. He made his uncle Claudius his consular colleague, tasked with siting statues of Caligula&#x27;s two dead brothers, and occasionally standing in for Caligula at games, feasts and ceremonies. Claudius&#x27; own family found his limp and stammer &quot;something of a public embarrassment&quot;; he mismanaged the statue commission and his first consulship ended soon after, alongside Caligula&#x27;s but his appointment elevated him from mere equestrian to senator, and eligible for consulship. Barrett and Yardley describe Claudius&#x27; consulship as an &quot;astonishingly enlightened gesture&quot; on Caligula&#x27;s part, not one of Caligula&#x27;s attempts to court popularity, as Suetonius would have it.

Caligula made a public show of burning Tiberius&#x27; secret papers, which gave details of his infamous treason trials. They included accusations of villainy and betrayal against various senators, many of whom had willingly assisted in prosecutions of their own number to gain financial advantage, imperial favour, or to divert suspicion away from themselves; any expression of dissatisfaction with the emperor&#x27;s rule or decisions could be taken as undermining the State, and lead to prosecution for &quot;maiestas&quot; (treason). Caligula claimed – falsely, as it later turned out – that he had read none of these documents before burning them. He used a coin issue to advertise his claim that he had restored the security of the laws, which had suffered during Tiberius&#x27; prolonged absence from Rome; he reduced a backlog of court cases in Rome by adding more jurors and suspending the requirement that sentences be confirmed by imperial office.

Stressing his descent from Augustus, Caligula retrieved the remains of his mother and brothers from their places of exile for interment in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Caligula began work on a temple to Livia, widow of Augustus; she held the honorific title of Augusta while still living, and when she died was eventually made a &quot;diva&quot; (goddess) of the Roman state under Claudius. The temple had been vowed in her lifetime, but not constructed.

==== Illness and recovery ====
Between approximately mid-October and mid-November 37, Caligula fell seriously ill through unknown causes and hovered for a month or so between life and death. Rome&#x27;s public places filled with citizens who implored the gods for his recovery, some even offering their own lives in exchange. By late October, their emperor had recovered, and embarked on what might have been a purge of suspected opponents or conspirators. Caligula&#x27;s relations with his senate had been congenial but were now sullied by the forced suicide, for reasons unknown, of the eminent senator Silanus, formerly Caligula&#x27;s father-in-law. Gemellus, Caligula&#x27;s adopted son and heir, now 18 years old and legally adult, was also disposed of. Suetonius offers several versions of Gemellus&#x27; death. In one, Gemellus was given the adult &quot;toga virilis&quot; then charged with having taken an antidote, &quot;implicitly accusing Caligula of wanting to poison him&quot;, and forced to kill himself. Several months later, in early 38, Caligula forced suicide on his Praetorian Prefect, Macro, without whose help and protection he would not have survived, let alone gained the throne as sole ruler. Any link between the deaths is speculative, but it is possible that Silanus had conspired to make Gemellus emperor, should Caligula fail to recover; and Caligula might simply have tired of Macro&#x27;s control and influence.

In 38, Caligula nominated Marcus Aemilius Lepidus as his heir, and married him to his beloved sister Drusilla, but on 19 June that year, Drusilla died. She was deified and renamed Panthea (&quot;All Goddesses&quot;); the first mortal woman in Roman history to be made a &quot;diva&quot; (goddess of state). Caligula, bereft, declared a period of compulsory, universal mourning. Drusilla&#x27;s death is one of several events approximate to the time of Caligula&#x27;s illness, besides the death of Antonia and any unreported effects of the illness itself, thought by some to contribute to a fundamental change in Caligula&#x27;s attitudes. Purges so early in Caligula&#x27;s reign suggest to Weidemann that &quot;the new emperor had learnt a great deal from Tiberius&quot; and &quot;that attempts to divide his reign into a &#x27;good&#x27; beginning followed by unremitting atrocities [...] are misplaced&quot;.

===Public profile===
Caligula shared many of the popular passions and enthusiasms of the lower classes and young aristocrats: public spectacles, particularly gladiator contests, chariot and horse racing, the theatre and gambling, but all on a scale with which the nobility could not match. He trained with professional gladiators and staged exceptionally lavish gladiator games, being granted exemption by the senate from the sumptuary laws that limited the number of gladiators to be kept in Rome. He was openly and vocally partisan in his uninhibited support or disapproval of particular charioteers, racing teams, gladiators and actors, shouting encouragement or scorn, sometimes singing along with paid performers or declaiming the actors&#x27; lines, and generally behaving as &quot;one of the crowd&quot;. In gladiator contests, he supported the &quot;parmularius&quot; type, who fought using small, round shields. In chariot races, he supported the Greens, and personally drove his favourite racehorse, Incitatus (&quot;Speedy&quot;) as a member of the Green faction. Most of Rome&#x27;s aristocracy would have found this an unprecedented, unacceptable indignity for any of their number, let alone their emperor.

Caligula showed little respect for distinctions of rank, status or privilege among the senate, whose members Tiberius had once described as &quot;men ready to be slaves&quot;. Among those whom Caligula recalled from exile were actors and other public performers who had somehow caused Tiberius offence. Caligula seems to have built a loyal following among his own loyal freedmen, citizen-commoners, disreputable public performers on whom he lavished money and other gifts; and the lower nobility (equestrians) rather than the senators and nobles whom he clearly and openly mistrusted, despised and humiliated for their insincere simulations of loyalty. Dio notes, with approval, that Caligula allowed some equestrians senatorial honours, anticipating their later promotion to senator based on their personal merits. To reverse declining membership of the equestrian order, Caligula recruited new, wealthy members empire-wide, and scrupulously vetted the order&#x27;s membership lists for signs of dishonesty or scandal. He seems to have ignored trivial misdemeanours, and would have anticipated the creation of &quot;new men&quot; (&quot;novi homines&quot;), first of their families to serve as senators. They would owe him a debt of gratitude and loyalty for their advancement.

Barrett describes some of the supposed equestrian offences punished by Caligula as &quot;decidedly trivial&quot;, and their punishments as sensationalist. Dio claims that Caligula had more than 26 equestrians executed in a circus &quot;fracas&quot;; in Suetonius&#x27; biography &quot;more than 20&quot; lives were lost in what is almost certainly the same event, described as a violent but accidental crush. Some sources claim that Caligula forced equestrians and senators to fight in the arena as gladiators. Condemnation to the gladiator arena as a combatant was a standard punishment, doubling as public entertainment, for non-citizens found guilty of certain offences. Laws of AD 19 by Augustus and Tiberius banned voluntary participation of the elite in any public spectacles, but the ban was never particularly effective, and was broadly ignored in Caligula&#x27;s reign. During Caligula&#x27;s illness two citizens, one of whom was an equestrian, offered to fight as gladiators if only the gods would spare the emperor&#x27;s life. The offers were insincere, intended to flatter and invite reward. When Caligula recovered, he insisted that they be taken at face value, to avoid accusations of perjury: &quot;cynical, but not without wit of a kind&quot;.

=== Public reform and finance ===

In 38, Caligula lifted censorship, and published accounts of public funds and expenditure. Suetonius congratulates this as the first such act by any emperor. Very soon after his succession, he restored the right of the popular assembly (comitia) to elect magistrates on behalf of the common citizenry, a right that had been taken over by the Senate under Tiberius and Augustus. The aediles, elected officials who managed public games and festivals, and maintained the fabric of roads and shrines, would now have incentive to spend their own money on lavish, high-profile spectacles and other &quot;munera&quot; (gifts to the state or people), to win the popular vote. Dio writes that this, &quot;though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many... many disasters would result&quot;. When the Senate outright refused to accept this, Caligula restored control of elections to them. Either way, the emperor ultimately chose which candidates stood for election, and which were elected. Caligula was quite capable of recognising his own plans and decisions as flawed, and abandoning, revising or reversing them when faced with opposition. He was open to good advice, but could just as easily take its offering as an insult to his youth or understanding – Philo quotes his warning &quot;Who dares teach me?&quot; Caligula abandoned his plan to convert the Temple of Jerusalem to a temple of the Imperial cult, with a statue of himself as Zeus, when warned that the plan would arouse extreme protests, and injure the local economy. He gave funds where they were needed; he helped those who lost property in fires, and abolished a deeply unpopular tax on sales, but whether his extravagant gifts to favourites during his earliest reign – be they actors, charioteers or other public performers – drew on his personal wealth or state coffers is not known. Personal generosity and magnanimity, coupled with discretion and responsibility, were expected of the ruling elite, and the emperor in particular. At some time, Caligula ruled that bequests to office-holders remain property of the office, not of the office-holder.

==== Tax and treasury ====
Suetonius claims that Caligula squandered 2.7 billion sesterces in his first year. and addressed the consequent treasury deficit by confiscating the estates of wealthy individuals, after false accusations, fines or outright seizure, even the death penalty, as a means of raising money. This seems to have started in earnest around the time of Caligula&#x27;s confrontation with the senate (in early 39). Suetonius&#x27;s retrospective balance sheet overlooks what would have been owed to Caligula, personally and in his capacity as emperor, on Tiberius&#x27; death, and the release of the former emperor&#x27;s hoarded wealth into the economy at large. Caligula&#x27;s inheritance included the deceased empress Livia&#x27;s vast bequest, which Caligula distributed among its nominated public, private and religious beneficiaries. Barrett in &quot;Caligula: The Abuse of Power&quot; asserts that this &quot;massive cash injection would have given the Roman economy a tremendous boost&quot;.

Dio remarks the beginnings of a financial crisis in 39, and connects it to the cost of Caligula&#x27;s extravagant bridge-building project at Baiae. Suetonius has presumably the same financial crisis starting in 38; he does not mention a bridge but lists a broad range of Caligula&#x27;s extravagances, said to have exhausted the state treasury.

To Wilkinson, Caligula&#x27;s uninterrupted use of precious metals in coin issues does not suggest a bankrupt treasury, though there must have been a blurring of boundaries between Caligula&#x27;s personal wealth, and his income as head of state. Caligula&#x27;s immediate successor, Claudius, abolished taxes, embarked on various costly building projects and donated 15,000 sesterces to each Praetorian Guard in 41 as his own reign began, which suggests that Caligula had left him a solvent treasury.

In the long term, the occasional windfall aside, Caligula&#x27;s spending exceeded his income. Fund-raising through taxation became a major preoccupation. Provincial citizens were liable for direct payment of taxes used to fund the military, a payment from which Italians were exempt. Caligula abolished some taxes, including the deeply unpopular sales tax, but he introduced an unprecedented range of new ones, and rather than employ professional tax farmers (publicani) in their collection, he made this a duty of the notoriously forceful Praetorian Guard. Dio and Suetonius describe these taxes as &quot;shameful&quot;: some were remarkably petty. Caligula taxed &quot;taverns, artisans, slaves and the hiring of slaves&quot;, edibles sold in the city, litigation anywhere in the Empire, weddings or marriages, the wages of porters &quot;or perhaps couriers&quot;, and most infamously, a tax on prostitutes (active, retired or married) or their pimps, liable for &quot;a sum equivalent to a single transaction&quot;. Citizens of provincial Italy lost their previous tax exemptions. Most individual tax bills were fairly small but cumulative; over Caligula&#x27;s brief reign, taxes were doubled overall. Even then, the revenue was nowhere near enough, and the imposition was deeply resented by Rome&#x27;s commoners. Josephus claims that this led to riotous protests at the Circus. Barrett remarks that stories of consequent &quot;mass executions&quot; there by the military should &quot;almost certainly&quot; be dismissed as &quot;standard exaggeration&quot;.

Property or money left to Tiberius as emperor but not collected on his death would have passed to Caligula as office-holder. Roman inheritance law recognised a legator&#x27;s obligation to provide for his family; Caligula seems to have considered his fatherly duties to the state entitled him to a share of every will from pious subjects. The army was not exempt; centurions who left nothing or too little to the emperor could be judged guilty of ingratitude, and have their wills set aside. Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to turn over their spoils to the state.

Stories of a brothel in the Imperial palace, staffed by Roman aristocrats, matrons and their children, are taken literally by Suetonius and Dio; McGinn believes they could be based on a single incident, extended to an institution in the telling. Similar allegations would be made in the future against Commodus and Elagabalus. Winterling, citing Dio 59.28.9, traces the outline of the story to Cassius Dio&#x27;s account for AD 40, and his allegation that the noble tenants of newly built suites of rooms at the palace were compelled to pay exorbitant rents for the privilege of living so close to Caligula, and under the protection of the praetorians. No brothel is mentioned in this account. Suetonius appears to reverse the traditional aristocratic client-patron ceremonies of mutual obligation, and have Caligula accepting payments for maintenance from his loyal consular &quot;friends&quot; at morning salutations, evening banquets, and bequest announcements. The sheer numbers of &quot;friends&quot; involved meant that meticulous records were kept of who had paid, how much, and who still owed. His agents would then visit the very same consuls who had been involved in conspiracies against him, rail against the Senate&#x27;s treachery &quot;en masse&quot; but ask for &quot;gifts&quot; from individuals to express their loyal friendship in return. A refusal was unthinkable. Winterling describes the families who occupied these rooms as hostage, under the supervision of the Praetorians; some paid up willingly, some reluctantly, but all paid. Caligula made loans available at high interest to those who lacked the necessary funds, to complete the humiliation of Rome&#x27;s elite, especially the old Republican families.

Despite his biographers&#x27; attempts to ridicule Caligula&#x27;s taxes, many were continued after his death. The military remained responsible for all tax collection, and the tax on prostitution continued up to the reign of Severus Alexander. Caligula&#x27;s ruling that bequests made to any reigning emperor became property of his office, not himself as a private individual, was made constitutional under Antoninus Pius.

==== Coinage ====
Caligula did not change the structure of the monetary system established by Augustus and continued by Tiberius, but the contents of his coinage differed from theirs. The location of the imperial mint for the coins of precious metals (gold and silver) is a matter of debate among ancient numismatists. It seems that Caligula initially produced his precious coins from Lugdunum (now Lyon, France), like his predecessors, then moved the mint to Rome in 37–38, although it is possible that this move occurred later, under Nero. His base metal coinage was struck in Rome.

Unlike Tiberius, whose coins remained almost unchanged throughout his reign, Caligula used a variety of types, mostly featuring Divus Augustus, as well as his parents Germanicus and Agrippina, his dead brothers Nero and Drusus, and his three sisters Agrippina, Drusilla, and Livilla. The reason for the extensive emphasis on his relatives was to highlight Caligula&#x27;s double claim to the Principate, from both the Julian and Claudian sides of the dynasty, and to call for the unity of the family. The sesterce with his three sisters was discontinued after 39, due to Caligula&#x27;s suspicion regarding their loyalty. He also made a sesterce celebrating the Praetorian cohorts as a mean to give them the bequest of Tiberius at the beginning of his reign. Caligula minted a quadrans, a small bronze coin, to mark the abolition of the &quot;ducentesima&quot;, a 0.5% tax on sales. The output of the precious metal mints was small and his sesterces were mostly made in limited quantities, which make his coins now very rare. This rarity cannot be attributed to Caligula&#x27;s alleged &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; reported by Dio, as removing his coins from circulation would have been impossible; besides, Mark Antony&#x27;s coins continued to circulate for two centuries after his death. Caligula&#x27;s common coins are base metal types with Vesta, Germanicus, and Agrippina the Elder, and the most common is an as with his grandfather Agrippa. Finally, Caligula kept open the mint at Caesarea in Cappadocia, which had been created by Tiberius, in order to pay military expenses in the province with silver drachmae.

Numismatists Harold Mattingly and Edward Sydenham consider that the artistic style of Caligula&#x27;s coins is below those of Tiberius and Claudius; they especially criticize the portraits, which are too hard and lack details.

=== Construction ===

Caligula had a fondness for grandiose, costly building projects, many of which were intended to benefit or entertain the general population but are described in Roman sources as wasteful. In the city of Rome, he completed the temple of Augustus and the theatre of Pompey. He is said to have built a bridge between the temple of Castor and Pollux and the Capitol. Barrett (2015) believes that this bridge existed only in Suetonius&#x27; account, and should perhaps be dismissed as a fantasy, with possible origins in some jocular remark by Caligula.

Caligula began an amphitheatre beside the Saepta Julia; he cleared the latter space for use as an arena, and filled it with water for a single naumachia (a sham naval battle fought as entertainment). He supervised the extension and rebuilding of the imperial palace to include a gallery for his art collection. Philo and his party were given a tour of the gallery during their diplomatic visit. Barrett (2015) considers Philo&#x27;s description of Caligula as a &quot;would-be connoisseur and aesthete&quot; as &quot;probably not very wide of the mark.&quot; To help meet Rome&#x27; burgeoning demand for fresh water, he began the construction of aqueducts Aqua Claudia and Anio Novus, which Pliny the Elder considered to be engineering marvels. He built a large racetrack, now known as the Circus of Gaius and Nero. In its central spine he incorporated an Egyptian obelisk, now known as the Vatican obelisk, which he had brought by sea on a gigantic, purpose-built ship, which used 120,000 modi of lentils as ballast.

At Syracuse, he repaired the city walls and temples. He pushed to keep roads in good condition throughout the empire, and extended the existing network: to this end, Caligula investigated the financial affairs of current and past highway commissioners. Those guilty of negligence, embezzlement or misuse of funds were forced to repay what they had dishonestly used for other purposes, or fulfil their commissions at their own expense. Caligula planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus, and house his own cult and image there: and to found a city high up in the Alps. He intended to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the site. None of these plans came to fruition.

=== Treason trials ===
In the course of 39, Caligula&#x27;s increasingly tense relationship with his Senate deteriorated into outright hostility and confrontation. This is one of Dio&#x27;s more confusing accounts, involving conspiracies, denunciations and trials for treason (&quot;maiestas&quot;), following Caligula&#x27;s launch of invective at the entire senate, reviewing and condemning their current and past behaviour. He accused them of servility, treachery and hypocrisy in voting honours to Tiberius and Sejanus while they lived, and rescinding those honours once their recipients were safely dead. He declared that it would be folly to seek the love or approval of such men: they hated him, and wanted him dead, so it would be better that they should fear him. Caligula&#x27;s diatribes exposed the idealised &quot;princeps&quot; or First Senator as illusion and imposture. When the senate returned next day, they seemed to confirm his suspicions, and voted him a special guard of armed pretorians to protect him and guard his statues. Apparently seeking to please him and assure his safety, the Senate proposed that his senatorial chair be raised &quot;on a high platform even in the very Senate house&quot;. They offered a thanksgiving to Caligula, as to a monarch, expressing gratitude for allowing them to live when others had died. Winterling suggests that Caligula&#x27;s three subsequent consulships, sworn at the Rostra, were vain attempts to make amends, public statements of respect for the senators as his equals. Barrett perceives these later consulships as symbolic of Caligula&#x27;s continued intention to dominate the senate and the state; Barrett describes the change in Caligula&#x27;s rule as a gradual unravelling, a &quot;descent into serious mismanagement and impenetrable mistrust&quot; – and, latterly, into &quot;arbitrary terror&quot;; but Dio&#x27;s claim that in fact, &quot;there was nothing but slaughter&quot; is undermined by evidence that most senators managed to survive Caligula&#x27;s reign with their persons and fortunes intact.

Caligula had not, after all, destroyed Tiberius&#x27; records of treason trials. He reviewed them and decided that numerous senators discharged from Tiberius&#x27; court hearings seemed to have been guilty of conspiracy all along, against emperor and state – the worst form of &quot;maiestas&quot; (treason). Tiberius&#x27; treason trials had encouraged professional &quot;delatores&quot; (informers), who were loathed by the populace, but many of the accused had testified against each other, and against Caligula&#x27;s own family, even to the point of initiating the prosecutions themselves. If they had acted against Caligula&#x27;s family, they might act against Caligula himself. New investigations were launched; Dio names five once-trusted, consular senators tried for &quot;maiestas&quot;, but his allegation that senators or others were put to death in &quot;great numbers&quot; is unsupported. Two of the five prospered under his rule, and beyond. Caligula preferred to publicly humiliate his enemies in the senate, especially those of ancient families, by stripping them of their inherited honours, dignities and titles. In early September, he dismissed the two suffect consuls, citing their inadequate, low-key celebration of his birthday (August 31) and excessive attention to the anniversary of Actium (September 2). This was the last battle in a damaging civil war between two of Caligula&#x27;s close ancestors, which he found no cause for celebration. One of the dismissed consuls killed himself: Caligula may have suspected him of conspiracy.

==== Incitatus ====
Suetonius and Dio outline Caligula&#x27;s supposed proposal to promote his favourite racehorse, Incitatus (&quot;Swift&quot;), to consul, and later, a priest of his own cult. This could have been an extended joke, created by Caligula himself in mockery of the senate. A persistent, popular belief that Caligula actually promoted his horse to consul has become &quot;a byword for the promotion of incompetents&quot;, especially in political life. It may have been one of Caligula&#x27;s many oblique, malicious or darkly humorous insults, mostly directed at the senatorial class, but also against himself and his family. Winterling sees it as an insult to the consulars themselves. An aristocrat&#x27;s highest ambition, the consulship, could be laid open to ruinous competition and at the same time, to ridicule. David Woods believes it unlikely that Caligula meant to insult the post of consul, as he had held it himself. Suetonius, possibly failing to get the joke, presents it as further proof of Caligula&#x27;s insanity, adding circumstantial details more usually expected of the senatorial nobility, including palaces, servants and golden goblets, and invitations to banquets.

==== Bridge at Baiae ====
In 39 or 40, by Suetonius&#x27; reckoning, Caligula ordered a temporary floating bridge to be built using a double line of ships as pontoons, earth-paved and stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae, near Naples, to the neighbouring port of Puteoli, with resting places between. Some ships were built on site but grain ships were also requisitioned, brought to site, secured and temporarily resurfaced. Any practical purpose for the bridge is unclear; Winterling believes that it might have been intended to mark Caligula&#x27;s attempted invasion of Britain. A two-day ceremonial was performed, with offerings to the sea-god Neptune and Invidia (Envy), and a satisfactory result, in that the sea remained completely calm. The bridge was said to rival the Persian king Xerxes&#x27; pontoon bridge across the Hellespont.

For the opening ceremony, Caligula donned the supposed breastplate of Alexander the Great, and rode his favourite horse, Incitatus, across the bridge, perhaps defying a prediction, attributed by Suetonius to Tiberius&#x27; soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes, that Caligula had &quot;no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae&quot;. On the second day, he rode the bridge from end to end several times &quot;at full tilt&quot;, accompanied by the soldiery, famous nobles and hostages. Seneca and Dio claim that grain imports were dangerously depleted by Caligula&#x27;s re-purposing of Rome&#x27;s grain ships as pontoons. Barrett finds these accusations absurd; if the bridge was finished in 39, that was far too early to have had any effect on the annual grain supply, and &quot;a genuine grain crisis was simply blamed on the most outlandish episode at hand.&quot; Dio places this episode soon after Caligula&#x27;s furious denunciation of the Senate; Barrett speculates that Caligula may have intended the whole event as an object lesson on how completely he was in charge: it may also provide &quot;the most striking example of his wasteful extravagance&quot;; its pointlessness might have been the whole point.

===Provinces===
==== Judaea and Egypt ====
Caligula&#x27;s reign saw an increase of tensions between Jews native to their homeland of Judea, Jews of the diaspora, and ethnic Greeks. Greeks and Jews had settled throughout the Roman Empire and Judaea was ruled as a Roman client kingdom. Jews and Greeks had settled in Egypt following its conquest by Macedonian Greeks, and remained there after its conquest by Rome. While the Alexandrian Greeks held citizen status, Alexandrian Jews were classified as mere settlers, with no statutory or citizen rights other than those granted them by their Roman governors. The Greeks feared that official recognition of Jews as citizens would undermine their own status and privilege.

Caligula had replaced the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus, with Herod Agrippa, who was governor of Batanaea and Trachonitis, and was a personal friend. Flaccus had conspired against Caligula&#x27;s mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists. In 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus. According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers and mockery from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as a gimcrack &quot;king of the Jews.” In Philo&#x27;s account, a mob of Greeks broke into synagogues to erect statues and shrines of Caligula, against Jewish religious law. Flaccus responded by declaring the Jews &quot;foreigners and aliens&quot;, and expelled them from all but one of Alexandria&#x27;s five districts, where they lived under dreadful conditions. Philo gives an account of various atrocities inflicted on Alexandria&#x27;s Jews within and around this ghetto by the city&#x27;s Greek population. Caligula held Flaccus responsible for the disturbances, exiled him, and eventually executed him.

In 39, Agrippa accused his uncle Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of Parthia. Herod Antipas confessed, Caligula exiled him, and Agrippa was rewarded with his territories. Riots again erupted in Alexandria in 40 between Jews and Greeks, when Jews who refused to venerate the emperor as a god were accused of dishonouring him. In the Judaean city of Jamnia, resident Greeks built a shoddy, sub-standard altar to the Imperial cult, intending to provoke a reaction from the Jews; they immediately tore it down. This was interpreted as an act of rebellion. In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem, a political, rather than a religious act for Rome, but a blasphemy for the Jews, and in conflict with Jewish monotheism. In this context, Philo wrote that Caligula &quot;regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his&quot;.

In May of 40, Philo accompanied a deputation of Alexandrian Jews and Greeks to Caligula, and a second deputation after 31 August that year, during the worst of the Alexandrian riots. Neither of these encounters proved decisive. Both gave Caligula ample opportunity for casual, friendly banter, which seems to have included humiliating levity, always at the Jewish delegation&#x27;s expense; but he made no claims of divinity, either in his dress nor his speech, merely asking at the second encounter, more or less rhetorically, why Jews found his veneration so difficult. Philo and Josephus each saw Caligula&#x27;s behaviour as driven by his claims to divinity, which for a Jew would have virtually defined him as fundamentally insane, despite appearances otherwise.

The ethnically Greek population of Alexandria had already made their loyalty to the new emperor clear, with displays of his image as focus for his cult. The destruction of the altar at Jamlia and, presumably, removal of &quot;idolatrous&quot; images placed in synagogues by Greek citizens, might have been intended as an expression of Jewish religious fervour, rather than a response aimed at one tyrant&#x27;s offensive claims of personal godhood. Philo seems to have loathed Caligula from the start, but his belief that Caligula hated the Jews and was preparing their destruction has no basis in evidence. To place Caligula&#x27;s statue in Temple precincts, showing him dressed as Jupiter, would have been consistent with the Empire-wide religious phenomenon known as Imperial cult, from whose full expression Jews had so far been exempted; they could offer prayer &quot;for&quot; the emperor, rather than &quot;to&quot; him; far from a perfect compromise but the highest honour that Jewish tradition permitted in honour of a mortal. Caligula found this most unsatisfactory, and demanded that his statue be installed in the Temple of Jerusalem forthwith.

The Governor of Syria, Publius Petronius, ordered a statue from Sidon, then postponed its installation for as long he could, rather than risk a serious Jewish rebellion. In some versions, Caligula proved amenable to rational discussion with Agrippa and Jewish authorities, and faced with threats of rebellion, destruction of property and loss of the grain-harvest if the plan went ahead, abandoned the project. In more hostile versions Caligula, being demonstrably insane, and incapable of rational discussion, impulsively changed his mind once again, and reissued the order to Petronius along with the threat of enforced suicide if he failed. An even larger statue of Caligula-Zeus was ordered from Rome; the ship carrying it was still under way when news of Caligula&#x27;s death reached Petronius. Caligula&#x27;s plan was abandoned, Petronius survived and the statue was never installed.

Philo reports a rumour that in 40, Caligula announced to the Senate that he planned to move to Alexandria, and rule the Empire from there as a divine monarch, a Roman pharaoh. Very similar rumours attended Julius Caesar&#x27;s last days, up to his assassination and very much to his discredit. Caligula&#x27;s ancestor Mark Antony took refuge in Egypt with Cleopatra, and Augustus had made it a so-called &quot;Imperial province&quot;, under his direct control. It was the main source of Italy&#x27;s grain supply, and was administered by members of the equestrian order, directly responsible to the ruling emperor. Egypt was, more or less, Caligula&#x27;s property, to dispose of as he wished. Roman knowledge of pharaonic brother-sister marriages to maintain the royal bloodline would have shored up the many flimsy, scandalised allegations of adolescent incest between Caligula and Drusilla, supposedly discovered by Antonia but reported as rumour, and only by Suetonius. Barrett finds no further evidence for these allegations, and advises a skeptical attitude.

==== Germany and the Rhine frontier ====

In late 39 or early 40, Caligula ordered the concentration of military forces and supplies in upper Germany, and made his way there with a baggage train that supposedly included actors, gladiators, women, and a detachment of Praetorians. He might have meant to follow the paths of his father and grandfather, and attack the Germanic tribes along the upper Rhine; but according to ancient historians he was ill-prepared, and retreated in a panic. Modern historians, however, suppose that he had a valid political reason for his Germanic operation, and might even have been successful with that. But the exact locations and enemies of his campaign cannot be determined; possibilities include the Chatti in and around modern-day Hesse or the Suebi east of the Upper Rhine.

The ancient sources report that Caligula used the opportunity of his operations in Germany to seize the wealth of rich allies whom he conveniently suspected of treason, &quot;putting some to death on the grounds that they were &#x27;plotting&#x27; or &#x27;rebelling&#x27;&quot;. Caligula accused the Imperial legate, Gaetulicus, of &quot;nefarious plots&quot;, and had him executed – according to Dio, he was killed for being popular with his troops. Lepidus, along with Caligula&#x27;s two sisters, Agrippina and Livilla, was accused of being part of this conspiracy; he too was executed and Caligula&#x27;s two sisters were exiled after being condemned &quot;pro forma&quot; for adultery.

A senatorial embassy arrived from Rome, headed by Caligula&#x27;s uncle Claudius, to congratulate the emperor for suppressing this latest conspiracy. It met with a hostile reception, in which Claudius was supposedly ducked in the Rhine (though this might have been the loser&#x27;s award in a contest of Latin and Greek oratory held by Caligula in Gaul that winter). On Caligula&#x27;s return from the north, he abandoned the theatre seating plans that Augustus had introduced so that rank alone would determine one&#x27;s place. In the consequent free-for-all, seating was left to chance; doubtless to Caligula&#x27;s pleasure, fights broke out as senators competed with common citizens for the best seats. Very late in his reign, possibly in its last few days, Caligula sent a communique in preparation for his imminent ovation in Rome, following his military activities in the North and his suppression of Lepidus. He announced that he would only be returning &quot;to those who wanted him back&quot;; to the &quot;Equestrians and the People&quot;; he did not mention the Senate or senators, of whom he had grown increasingly mistrustful.

====Auctions====
In late 39, Caligula wintered at Lugdunum (modern Lyon) in Gaul, where he auctioned off his sisters&#x27; portable property, including their jewellery, slaves and freedmen. Dio claims that wealthy bidders at these auctions were willing to offer far more than items were worth; some to show their loyalty, and others to rid themselves of some of the wealth that could render their execution worthwhile. Caligula is said to have used intimidation and various auctioneer&#x27;s tricks and tactics to boost prices. In an event that Suetonius describes as &quot;well known&quot;, a Praetorian gentleman, nodding off to sleep after a gladiator match, woke to find that he had bought 13 gladiators for the vastly over-inflated sum of 9 million sesterces. Caligula&#x27;s first Lugdunum auction proved such a successful fundraiser that he had many of the furnishings of his palace in Rome carted to Lugdunum and auctioned off; they included many precious family heirlooms. Caligula recited their provenance during the auction, in an attempt to help ensure a fair return on objects intrinsically valuable, and seemingly much sought after by the wealthy for their Imperial associations.

Income from this second auction was relatively moderate. Kleijwegt (1996) describes Caligula&#x27;s performance as vendor and auctioneer at this second auction as &quot;completely out of character with the image of a tyrant&quot;. Auctions of Imperial property were acceptable ways to &quot;balance the books&quot;, practiced by Augustus and later, by Trajan; they were expected to benefit the bidders as well as the vendor; Roman auctioneers were held in very low esteem, but Kleijwegt claims that Caligula seems to have behaved more like a benevolent &quot;princeps&quot; in this second auction, without malice, greed or intimidation.

==== Britannia ====
In the spring of 40, Caligula tried to extend Roman rule into Britannia. Two legions had been raised for this purpose, both likely named &quot;Primigeniae&quot; in honour of Caligula&#x27;s newborn daughter. Ancient sources depict Caligula as being too cowardly to have attacked or as mad, but stories of his threatening a decimation of his troops indicate mutinies. Broadly, &quot;it is impossible to judge why the army never embarked&quot; on the invasion. Beyond mutinies, it may have simply been that British chieftains acceded to Rome&#x27;s demands, removing any justification for war. Alternatively, it could have been merely a training and scouting mission or a short expedition to accept the surrender of the British chieftain Adminius. Suetonius reports that Caligula ordered his men to collect seashells as &quot;spoils of the sea&quot;; this may also be a mistranslation of , meaning siege engines. The conquest of Britannia was later achieved during the reign of Caligula&#x27;s successor, Claudius.

==== Mauretania ====

In 40, Caligula annexed Mauretania, a wealthy, strategically significant client kingdom of Rome, inhabited by fiercely independent semi-nomads who resisted Romanisation. Its ruler, Ptolemy of Mauretania, was a noble descendant of Juba II, popular, extremely wealthy and with a reputation as &quot;feckless and incompetent&quot;. Ptolemy failed to deal effectively with an uprising and was removed. The usual fate of incompetent client kings was retirement and a comfortable exile, but Caligula ordered Ptolemy to Rome and had him executed, some time after the spring of 40. His removal proved unpopular enough in Mauretania to provoke an uprising.

Rome divided Mauretania into two provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division was the work of Caligula, but Dio states that the uprising was subdued in 42 (after Caligula&#x27;s death), by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but postponed the division because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the joint provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in 44.

Details on the Mauretanian events of 39–44 are lost, including an entire chapter by Dio on the annexation. Dio and Tacitus suggest that Caligula may have been motivated by fear, envy, and consideration of his own ignominious military performance in the north, rather than pressing military or economic needs. The rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula&#x27;s expansion was a prudent and ultimately successful response to potential future threats.

=== Religion ===

According to Barrett, &quot;[o]f all the manifestations of wild and extravagant behaviour exhibited by Caligula during his brief reign, nothing has better served to confirm the popular notion of his insanity than his apparent demand to be recognised as a god.&quot;

Philo, Caligula&#x27;s contemporary, claims that Caligula costumed himself as various heroes and deities, starting with demigods such as Dionysos, Herakles and the Dioscuri, and working up to major deities such as Mercury, Venus and Apollo. Philo describes these impersonations in a context of private pantomime or theatrical performances he may have witnessed or heard of during his diplomatic visit, as evidence that Caligula wanted to be venerated as a living god. Philo, as a Jew and a monotheist, took this as proof of the emperor&#x27;s insanity.

Caligula&#x27;s impersonations had a precedent; Augustus had once thrown a party in which he and his guests dressed up as the Olympian gods; Augustus was made up and dressed as Apollo. No-one was thought insane in consequence, and none claimed to be the god they impersonated; but the event was not repeated. It showed near-blasphemous disrespect to the gods in question, and insensitivity to the population at large – the feast was staged during a famine. Coin issues of the official Roman mint, dated to the early 20s BC, show Octavian as Apollo, Jupiter and Neptune. This too may have been thought a transgression, and was not repeated. Caligula took his own impersonations less seriously than some, certainly less seriously than Philo did. According to Dio, when a Gallic shoemaker laughed to see Caligula dressed as Jupiter, pronouncing oracles at the crowd from a lofty place, Caligula asked &quot;and who do you think I am?&quot; The shoemaker answered &quot;a complete idiot&quot;. Caligula seems to have appreciated his straightforward honesty.

Dio claims that Caligula impersonated Jupiter to seduce various women; that he sometimes referred to himself as a divinity in public meetings; and that he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Jupiter&quot; in public documents. Caligula&#x27;s special interest in Jupiter as Rome&#x27;s chief deity is confirmed by all surviving sources. Simpson believes that Caligula may have considered Jupiter an equal, perhaps a rival.

According to Ittai Gradel, Caligula&#x27;s performances as various deities prove no more than a penchant for theatrical fancy-dress and a mischievous desire to shock; as emperor, Caligula was also &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, one of Rome&#x27;s most powerful and influential state priests. The promotion of mortal rulers to godlike status, to honour their superior standing and perceived merits, was a commonplace phenomenon among Rome&#x27;s eastern allies and client states; during their eastern tour, Germanicus, Agrippina and their children, including Caligula, were officially received as living deities by several cities of the Greek East. In Roman culture a client could flatter their living patron as &quot;Jupiter on Earth&quot;, without reprimand. The &quot;divi&quot; (deceased members of the Imperial family promoted to divine status) were creations of the Senate, who voted them into official existence, appointed their priesthood and granted them cult at state expense. Cicero could protest at the implications of Caesar&#x27;s divine honours while living but address Publius Lentulus as &quot;parens ac deus&quot; (parent and god) to thank him for his help, as aedile, against the conspirator Catiline. Daily reverence was offered as a matter of course to patrons, heads of household and the powerful by their clients, families and social inferiors. In 30 BC, libation-offerings to the &quot;genius&quot; of Octavian (later Augustus) became a duty at public and private banquets, and from 12 BC, state oaths were sworn by the &quot;genius&quot; of Augustus as the living emperor. Notwithstanding Dio&#x27;s claims that cult to living emperors was forbidden in Rome itself, there is abundant evidence of municipal cult to Augustus in his lifetime, in Italy and elsewhere, locally organised and financed. As Gradel observes, no Roman was ever prosecuted for sacrificing to his emperor.

Caligula seems to have taken his religious duties very seriously. He found a replacement for the aged priest of Diana at Lake Nemi, reorganised the Salii (priests of Mars), and pedantically insisted that as it was &quot;nefas&quot; (religiously improper) for Jupiter&#x27;s leading priest, the Flamen Dialis, to swear any oath, he could not swear the imperial oath of loyalty. Caligula wished to take over or share the half-finished but splendid Temple of Apollo in Greek Didyma for his own cult. Seemingly, his statue was prepared, but possibly not installed. When Pausanias visited the still-unfinished temple a century later, its cult statue was of Apollo.
Suetonius and Dio mention a temple to Caligula in the city of Rome. Most modern scholarship agrees that if such a temple existed, it was probably on the Palatine. Augustus had already linked the Temple of Castor and Pollux directly to his imperial residence on the Palatine, and established an official priesthood of lesser magistrates, the &quot;seviri Augustales&quot;, usually drawn from his own freedmen to serve the &quot;genius Augusti&quot; (his &quot;family spirit&quot;) and Lares (the twin ancestral spirits of his household). Dio claims that Caligula stationed himself to receive veneration, dressed as Jupiter Latiaris, between the images of Castor and Pollux, the twin Dioscuri, to whom he referred – humorously – as his doorkeepers. Dio&#x27;s claim that two temples were built for Caligula in Rome, is unconfirmed. Simpson believes it likely that Caligula, voted a temple on the Palatine by the Senate, funded it himself.

An embassy from Greek states to Rome greeted Caligula as the &quot;new god Augustus&quot;. In the Greek city of Cyzicus, a public inscription from the beginning of Caligula&#x27;s reign gives thanks to him as a &quot;New Sun-god&quot;. Egyptian provincial coinage and some state &quot;dupondii&quot; show Caligula enthroned; the first reigning Roman &quot;princeps&quot; to be described as the &quot;New Sun&quot;, () with the radiate crown of the Sun-god, or of Caligula&#x27;s divine antecedent, the Augustus. Caligula&#x27;s image on other state coinage carries no such &quot;trappings of divinity&quot;. Compared to the full-blown cults to major deities of state, &quot;genius&quot; cults were quite modest in scope. Augustus, once deceased, was officially worshipped as a – immortal, but somewhat less than a full-blown deity; Tiberius, his successor, forbade his own personal cult outright in Rome itself, probably in consideration of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination following his hubristic promotion as a living divinity. Augustus, and after him, Tiberius, insisted that if temples to honour them in the provinces were proposed by the local elite, they must be shared by the &quot;genius of the Senate&quot;, or the personification of the Roman people, or the &quot;genius&quot; of Rome itself.

Dio claims that Caligula sold priesthoods for his unofficial &quot;genius&quot; cult to the wealthiest nobles, for a &quot;per capita&quot; fee of 10 million sesterces, and made loans available to those who could not afford immediate full payment. His priests supposedly included his wife, Caesonia, and his uncle Claudius, whom Dio claims was bankrupted by the cost. The circumstances mark this out as private cult and personal humiliation among the wealthy elite, not subsidised by the Roman state. Throughout his reign, Caligula seems to have remained popular with the masses, in Rome and the empire. There is no sound evidence that he caused the removal, replacement or imposition of Roman or other deities, or even that he threatened to do so, outside the hostile anecdotes of his biographers. Barrett (2015) asserts that the &quot;emphatic and unequivocal message of the material evidence is that Caligula had no desire for the world to identify him as a god, even if, like most people, he enjoyed being treated like one.&quot; He did not demand worship as a living god; but he permitted it when it was offered; Imperial etiquette, and the examples of Augustus and Tiberius, would have him refuse divine honours but thank those who offered them, inferring their status as equal to his. He seems to have taken his own &quot;genius&quot; cult very seriously but his fatal offense was to willfully &quot;insult or offend everyone who mattered&quot;, including the military officers who assassinated him.

== Assassination and aftermath ==

On 24 January 41, the day before his due departure for Alexandria, Caligula was assassinated by the Praetorian tribunes Cassius Chaerea and Cornelius Sabinus, and a number of centurions. Josephus names many of Caligula&#x27;s inner circle as conspirators, and Dio seems to have had access to a senatorial version which purported to name many others. More likely, very few conspirators would have been involved, and not all need have been directly in touch with each other. The fewer who knew, the greater the chance of success. Previous attempts had foundered or faded out when faced with the rewards and risks of betrayal by colleagues, whether through torture, fear of torture or promised reward. The Senate was a disunited body of self-interested, wealthy and mistrustful aristocrats, unwilling to risk their own prospects, and determined to present a virtuous, united front. In Josephus&#x27; account of Caligula&#x27;s assassination, Chaerea was a &quot;noble idealist&quot;, deeply committed to &quot;Republican liberties&quot;; he was also motivated by resentment of Caligula&#x27;s routine personal insults and mockery. Suetonius and all other sources confirm that Caligula had insulted Chaerea, giving him watchwords like the ribald &quot;Priapus&quot; or &quot;Venus&quot;, the latter said to refer to Chaerea&#x27;s weak, high voice, and either his soft-hearted attitude when collecting taxes, or his duty to collect the tax on prostitutes. He was also known to do Caligula&#x27;s &quot;dirty work&quot; for him, including torture.

Chaerea, Sabinus and others accosted Caligula as he addressed an acting troupe of young men beneath the palace during a series of games and dramatics being held for the &quot;Divus&quot; Augustus. The source details vary, but all agree that Chaerea was first to stab Caligula. The narrow space available offered little room for escape or rescue, and by the time Caligula&#x27;s loyal Germanic guard could come to his defence, their Emperor was already dead. They killed several of Caligula&#x27;s party, including some innocent senators and bystanders. The killing only stopped when the Praetorians took control.

Josephus reports that the Senate tried to use Caligula&#x27;s death as an opportunity to restore the Republic. This would have meant the abolition of the office of emperor, the end of dynastic rule, and restoration of the former social stature and privilege of nobles and senators. At least one senator, Lucius Annius Vinicianus, seems to have thought it an opportunity for a takeover. Some modern scholars believe he was the conspiracy&#x27;s main instigator. Most ordinary citizens were taken aback by Caligula&#x27;s murder, and found no cause to celebrate in losing the benefits of his rule. Almost all the named conspirators were from the elite. When Caligula&#x27;s death was confirmed, the nobles and senators who had prospered through hypocrisy and sycophancy during his reign dared to claim prior knowledge of the plot, and share the credit for its success with their peers. Others sought to distance themselves from anything to do with it.

The assassins, fearing continued support for Caligula&#x27;s family and allies, sought out and murdered Caligula&#x27;s wife, Caesonia, and their young daughter Julia Drusilla, but were unable to reach Caligula&#x27;s uncle, Claudius. In the traditional account, a soldier, Gratus, found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain. A sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard smuggled him out to their nearby camp, and nominated him as emperor. The Senate, faced with what now seemed inevitable, confirmed their choice. Caligula&#x27;s &quot;most powerful and universally feared adviser&quot;, the freedman Callistus, may have engineered this succession, having discreetly shifted his loyalty from Caligula to Claudius while Caligula lived.

The killing of Caligula had been extralegal, tantamount to regicide, and those who carried it out had broken their oaths of loyalty to him. Claudius, as a prospective replacement for Caligula, could acknowledge his predecessor&#x27;s failings but could not be seen to condone his murder, or find fault with the principate as an institution. Caligula had been popular with a clear majority of Rome&#x27;s lesser citizenry, and the Senate could not afford to ignore the fact. Claudius appointed a new Praetorian prefect, and executed Chaerea, a tribune named Lupus, and the centurions involved. He allowed Sabinus to commit suicide.

Claudius refused the Senate&#x27;s requests to formally declare Caligula &quot;hostis&quot; (a public enemy), or condemn his memory (see &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;). He also turned down a proposal to officially condemn all the Caesars and destroy their temples. Caligula&#x27;s name was removed from the official lists of oaths and dedications; some inscriptions were removed or obliterated; most of his statues had the heads recut, to resemble Augustus, or Claudius, or in one case, Nero, who would suffer a similar fate.

According to Suetonius, Caligula&#x27;s body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters.

== Personal life ==
Caligula&#x27;s childhood health may have been delicate; Augustus appointed two physicians to accompany his journey north to join his parents, in AD 14; Suetonius connects this to possible childhood bouts of epilepsy. As an adult, he was subject to fainting fits. He was a habitually light sleeper, prone to nodding off during banquets, sleeping no more than 3 hours in any one night, and subject to vivid nightmares. Barrett describes him as &quot;nervous and highly strung&quot;. When speaking in public, he would fidget and move about, overcome by the flood of his own words and ideas; despite that, he was an eloquent speaker. He grew stronger with age, but was probably never robust or athletic, despite his practise as a charioteer. Little is known of his illness in 38, nor what it changed, if anything, but it was a serious, possibly life-threatening event. Philo blames it on Caligula&#x27;s habitual over-indulgence in rich foods and wine, general intemperance and a stress-induced nervous breakdown. Philo believed that the illness removed Caligula&#x27;s pretence of decency, and revealed his inner cruelty and ruthlessness, evident in the murders of his own father-in-law, Silanus, and young cousin Gemellus.

The sources are somewhat contradictory on the matter of Caligula&#x27;s sex life. Seneca claims that during a public banquet he humiliated senator Decimus Valerius Asiaticus, his &quot;especial friend&quot;, with a loud first-hand account of Valerius&#x27; wife&#x27;s disappointing performance in bed. Caligula is said to have had &quot;enormous&quot; sexual appetites, several mistresses and male lovers, but in relation to the alleged &quot;perversions&quot; practised at Corfu by Tiberius and, in some sources, shared by Caligula, Barrett finds him remarkably prudish in expelling the so-called &quot;spintriae&quot; from the island on his accession.

Caligula&#x27;s first wife was Junia Claudia, daughter of ex-consul Marcus Junius Silanus. Like most marriages in Rome&#x27;s upper echelons and, perhaps, all but one of Caligula&#x27;s four marriages, this was a political alliance, intended to produce a legitimate heir and further Caligula&#x27;s dynasty. Junia and her baby died in child-birth, less than a year later. Soon after, Macro seems to have persuaded his own wife, Ennia Thrasylla, to take up a sexual affair with Caligula, perhaps to help him through the loss. 
Suetonius and Dio claim that Caligula met Livia Orestilla at her marriage to Gaius Calpurnius Piso, and abducted her so that he could marry her instead and father a legitimate heir. When she proved faithful to her former husband, Caligula banished her. The Arval Brethren&#x27;s records confirm her marriage to Piso, but under ordinary Roman custom. Susan Wood dismisses Caligula&#x27;s &quot;marriage&quot; to her as a drunken party stunt. Caligula&#x27;s marriage to the &quot;beautiful... very wealthy&quot; and extravagant Lollia Paulina was quickly followed by divorce, on the grounds of her infertility. His fourth and last marriage, to Caesonia, seems to have been a love-match, in which he was both &quot;uxorious and monogamous&quot;, and fathered a daughter whom he named Julia Drusilla, in commemoration of his late sister. Caligula&#x27;s contemporaries could not understand his attraction to Caesonia; she had proved herself fertile in previous marriages but also had a reputation for &quot;high living and low morals&quot;, very far from the model of an aristocratic Roman wife. Tales reported by Josephus, Suetonius and the satirist Juvenal regarding Caligula&#x27;s sexual dynamism are inconsistent with rumours that Caesonia had to arouse his interest with a love potion, which turned his mind and brought on his &quot;madness&quot;. Barrett suggests that this rumour might have had no foundation other than Caligula&#x27;s quip that &quot;he felt like torturing Caesonia to discover why he loved her so passionately.

Allegations of incest between Caligula and his sisters, or just he and his favourite, Drusilla, go back no further than Suetonius, who admits that in his own time, they were hearsay. Seneca and Philo, moralising contemporaries of Caligula, do not mention these stories even after Caligula&#x27;s death, when it would have been safe to do so. Caligula&#x27;s devotion to his youngest sister was evident but then as now, allegations of incest fit the amoral, &quot;mad Emperor&quot; stereotype, promiscuous with money, sex and the lives of his subjects. Dio repeats, as fact, the rumour that Caligula also had &quot;improper relations&quot; with his two older sisters, Agrippina and Livilla.


== Mental condition ==

There is no reliable evidence of Caligula&#x27;s mental state at any time in his life. Had he been thought truly insane, his misdeeds would not have been thought his fault: Winterling points out that in Roman law, the insane were not legally responsible for their actions, no matter how extreme. Responsibility for their control and restraint fell on those around them. In the course of their narratives, all the primary and contemporary sources give reasons to discredit and ultimately condemn Caligula, for offences against proprieties of class, religion or his role as emperor. &quot;Thus, his acts should be seen from other angles, and the search for &#x27;mad Caligula&#x27; abandoned&quot; Barrett suggests that from a very early age, with the loss of his father, then of his mother and what remained of his family, Caligula was preoccupied with his own survival. Given near limitless powers to use as he saw fit, he used them to feed his sense of self-importance, &quot;practically devoid of any sense of moral responsibility, a man for whom the tenure of the principate was little more than an opportunity to exercise power&quot;. Caligula &quot;clearly had a highly developed sense of the absurd, resulting in a form of humour that was often cruel, sadistic and malicious, and which made its impact essentially by cleverly scoring points over those who were in no position to respond in kind.&quot;

Philo saw Caligula&#x27;s illness of 37 as a form of nervous collapse, a response to the extreme stresses and strains of Imperial rule, for which Caligula was temperamentally ill-equipped. Philo, Josephus and Seneca see Caligula&#x27;s apparent &quot;insanity&quot; as an underlying personality trait accentuated through self-indulgence and the unlimited exercise of power. Seneca acknowledges that Caligula&#x27;s promotion to emperor seemed to make him more arrogant, angry and insulting. Several modern sources suggest underlying medical conditions as explanations for some aspects of his behaviour and appearance. They include mania, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, encephalitis, meningitis, and epilepsy, the so-called &quot;falling sickness&quot;. Benediktson refines Suetonius&#x27; statement that Caligula could not swim to a diagnosis of interictal temporal lobe epilepsy, and a consequent fear of seizures that prevented his learning to swim. In Romano-Greek medical theory, severe epilepsy attacks were associated with the full moon and the moon goddess Selene, with whom Caligula was claimed to converse and enjoy sexual congress. Suetonius&#x27; descriptions of Caligula as physically repulsive are neither reliable nor likely, considering his ecstatic and enthusiastic reception as a youthful &quot;princeps&quot; by the populace. In the ancient world, a person&#x27;s physique was believed to be a reliable guide to their character and behaviour.

== Contemporary historiography ==

Most facts and circumstances of Caligula&#x27;s reign are lost to history. The two most important literary sources on Caligula and his reign are Suetonius, a government official of equestrian rank, born around 70 AD; and Cassius Dio, a Bithynian senator who held consulships in AD 205 and 229. Suetonius tends to arrange his material thematically, with little or no chronological framework, more biographer than historian. Dio provides a somewhat inconsistent chronology of Caligula&#x27;s reign. He dedicates 13–21 chapters to positive features of Caligula&#x27;s reign but nearly 40 to Caligula as &quot;monster&quot;.

Philo&#x27;s works &quot;On the Embassy to Gaius&quot; and &quot;Flaccus&quot; give some details on Caligula&#x27;s early reign, but more on events involving Jews in Judea and Egypt, whose political and religious interests conflicted with those of the ethnically Greek, pro-Roman population. Philo saw Caligula as responsible for the suffering of the Jews, whom he invariably portrays in a morally positive light. Seneca&#x27;s various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula&#x27;s personality, probably written in the reign of Claudius, who had a vested interest in the portrayal of his predecessor as &quot;cruel and despotic, even mad&quot;. Seneca was prone to &quot;grovelling flattery&quot; of whoever reigned at the time. His experience under Caligula &quot;could have clouded his judgment&quot;. He narrowly avoided a death sentence in AD 39, probably imposed for his association with known conspirators. Caligula had a low opinion of his literary style.

Further contemporaneous histories of Caligula&#x27;s reign are attested by Tacitus, who describes them as biased for or against Caligula; of Tacitus&#x27; own work, little of relevance to Caligula survives but Tacitus&#x27; works testify to his general hostility to the imperial system. Among the known losses of his works is a substantial portion of the &quot;Annals&quot;. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus wrote histories, now lost, condemning Caligula. Tacitus describes Fabius Rusticus as a friend of Seneca, prone to embellishments and misrepresentations. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in Caligula&#x27;s assassination; his original works are lost, but he was a competent historian, used as a primary source by Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius and Plutarch.

Caligula&#x27;s sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an autobiography that included a detailed account of Caligula&#x27;s reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against him. Caligula also seized the inheritance of Agrippina&#x27;s son, the future emperor Nero. Gaetulicus flattered Caligula in writings now lost. Suetonius wrote his biography of Caligula 80 years after his assassination, and Cassius Dio over 180 years after; the latter offers a loose chronology. Josephus gives a detailed account of Caligula&#x27;s assassination and its aftermath, published around 93 AD, but it is thought to draw upon a &quot;richly embroidered and historically imaginative&quot; anonymous biography of Herod Agrippa, presented as a Jewish &quot;national hero&quot;. Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; has a few brief references to Caligula, possibly based these on the accounts by his friend Suetonius, or an unnamed, shared source. Of the few surviving sources on Caligula, none paints Caligula in a favourable light. Little has survived on the first two years of his reign, and only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of Mauretania, Caligula&#x27;s military actions in Britannia, and the basis of his feud with the Senate.

== Modern depictions ==

=== In film and series ===

* Welsh actor Emlyn Williams was cast as Caligula in the never-completed 1937 film &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.
* He was played by Ralph Bates in the 1968 ITV historical drama series, &quot;The Caesars&quot;.
* American actor Jay Robinson famously portrayed a sinister and scene-stealing Caligula in two epic films of the 1950s, &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953) and its sequel &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; (1954).
* He was played by John Hurt in the 1976 BBC mini-series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.
* A feature-length historical film, &quot;Caligula&quot;, was completed in 1979 with Malcolm McDowell in the lead role.
* His reign is depicted across the second and third episodes of the miniseries &quot;A.D.: Anno Domini&quot;, which adapted the Acts of the Apostles in parallel with the history of the Caesars from Tiberus through Nero. He was portrayed by John McEnery. Many of Caligula&#x27;s connections to the other plotlines are via the fictional brother and sister Caleb and Sarah. However, it is also notable that Cornelius the Centurion is depicted as the man in charge of overseeing the installation of the Emperor&#x27;s statue in the Temple.
* He was portrayed by David Brandon in the 1982 historical exploitation film &quot;Caligula... The Untold Story&quot;.
* He was played by Alexis Arquette in two episodes of &quot;&quot;.
* Caligula is a character in the 2015 NBC series &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot;, and is played by British actor Andrew Gower. His portrayal emphasises Caligula&#x27;s &quot;debauched and dangerous&quot; persona as well as his sexual appetite, quick temper, and violent nature.

=== In literature and theatre ===
* &quot;Kajus Cezar Caligula&quot;, by Polish author Karol Hubert Rostworowski, is a play premiered in Juliusz Słowacki City Theater, Kraków, 31 March 1917. The title character is presented as a weak and unhappy man who became a victim of circumstances that brought him to power that surpassed him. 
* &quot;Caligula&quot;, by French author Albert Camus, is a play in which Caligula returns after deserting the palace for three days and three nights following the death of his beloved sister, Drusilla. The young emperor then uses his unfettered power to &quot;bring the impossible into the realm of the likely&quot;.
* In the 1934 novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by English writer Robert Graves, Caligula is presented as a murderous sociopath who became clinically insane early in his reign. In the novel, at the age of only ten, Caligula drove his father Germanicus to a state of despair and death by secretly terrorizing him. Graves&#x27; Caligula commits incest with all three of his sisters and is implied to have murdered Drusilla. The novel was adapted for television in the 1976 BBC mini-series of the same name.
* Incitatus, Caesar&#x27;s favourite horse, is the subject of Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert&#x27;s poem &quot;Kaligula&quot; (in &quot;Pan Cogito&quot;, 1974).

=== In opera ===

*A young Caligula appears as one of the characters in Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber&#x27;s opera &quot;Arminio&quot;.
*Caligula is the main character in Detlev Glanert&#x27;s opera &quot;Caligula&quot;, based on the Albert Camus play.
*Different composers from the Baroque era appear to have composed operatic works about Caligula, but most of these have been lost.

<text>In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the Turing–Church thesis, the Church–Turing conjecture, Church&#x27;s thesis, Church&#x27;s conjecture, and Turing&#x27;s thesis) is a about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:

* In 1933, Kurt Gödel, with Jacques Herbrand, formalized the definition of the class of general recursive functions: the smallest class of functions (with arbitrarily many arguments) that is closed under composition, recursion, and minimization, and includes zero, successor, and all projections.
* In 1936, Alonzo Church created a method for defining functions called the λ-calculus. Within λ-calculus, he defined an encoding of the natural numbers called the Church numerals. A function on the natural numbers is called λ-computable if the corresponding function on the Church numerals can be represented by a term of the λ-calculus.
* Also in 1936, before learning of Church&#x27;s work, Alan Turing created a theoretical model for machines, now called Turing machines, that could carry out calculations from inputs by manipulating symbols on a tape. Given a suitable encoding of the natural numbers as sequences of symbols, a function on the natural numbers is called Turing computable if some Turing machine computes the corresponding function on encoded natural numbers.

Church, Kleene, and Turing proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is &quot;general recursive&quot;. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).

On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the &quot;informal&quot; notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.

Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).

==Statement in Church&#x27;s and Turing&#x27;s words==
 addresses the notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; as follows: &quot;Clearly the existence of CC and RC (Church&#x27;s and Rosser&#x27;s proofs) presupposes a precise definition of &#x27;effective&#x27;. &#x27;Effective method&#x27; is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps&quot;. Thus the adverb-adjective &quot;effective&quot; is used in a sense of &quot;1a: producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect&quot;, and &quot;capable of producing a result&quot;.

In the following, the words &quot;effectively calculable&quot; will mean &quot;produced by any intuitively &#x27;effective&#x27; means whatsoever&quot; and &quot;effectively computable&quot; will mean &quot;produced by a Turing-machine or equivalent mechanical device&quot;. Turing&#x27;s &quot;definitions&quot; given in a footnote in his 1938 Ph.D. thesis &quot;Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals&quot;, supervised by Church, are virtually the same:
 We shall use the expression &quot;computable function&quot; to mean a function calculable by a machine, and let &quot;effectively calculable&quot; refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions.

The thesis can be stated as: &quot;Every effectively calculable function is a computable function&quot;.
Church also stated that &quot;No computational procedure will be considered as an algorithm unless it can be represented as a Turing Machine&quot;.
Turing stated it this way:
It was stated ... that &quot;a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process&quot;. We may take this literally, understanding that by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. The development ... leads to ... an identification of computability with effective calculability. [ is the footnote quoted above.]

==History==
One of the important problems for logicians in the 1930s was the Entscheidungsproblem of David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann, which asked whether there was a mechanical procedure for separating mathematical truths from mathematical falsehoods. This quest required that the notion of &quot;algorithm&quot; or &quot;effective calculability&quot; be pinned down, at least well enough for the quest to begin. But from the very outset Alonzo Church&#x27;s attempts began with a debate that continues to this day. the notion of &quot;effective calculability&quot; to be (i) an &quot;axiom or axioms&quot; in an axiomatic system, (ii) merely a &quot;definition&quot; that &quot;identified&quot; two or more propositions, (iii) an &quot;empirical hypothesis&quot; to be verified by observation of natural events, or (iv) just &quot;a proposal&quot; for the sake of argument (i.e. a &quot;thesis&quot;)?

=== Circa 1930–1952 ===
In the course of studying the problem, Church and his student Stephen Kleene introduced the notion of λ-definable functions, and they were able to prove that several large classes of functions frequently encountered in number theory were λ-definable. The debate began when Church proposed to Gödel that one should define the &quot;effectively computable&quot; functions as the λ-definable functions. Gödel, however, was not convinced and called the proposal &quot;thoroughly unsatisfactory&quot;. Rather, in correspondence with Church (c. 1934–1935), Gödel proposed &quot;axiomatizing&quot; the notion of &quot;effective calculability&quot;; indeed, in a 1935 letter to Kleene, Church reported that:

But Gödel offered no further guidance. Eventually, he would suggest his recursion, modified by Herbrand&#x27;s suggestion, that Gödel had detailed in his 1934 lectures in Princeton NJ (Kleene and Rosser transcribed the notes). But he did not think that the two ideas could be satisfactorily identified &quot;except heuristically&quot;.

Next, it was necessary to identify and prove the equivalence of two notions of effective calculability. Equipped with the λ-calculus and &quot;general&quot; recursion, Kleene with help of Church and J. Barkley Rosser produced proofs (1933, 1935) to show that the two calculi are equivalent. Church subsequently modified his methods to include use of Herbrand–Gödel recursion and then proved (1936) that the Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable: there is no algorithm that can determine whether a well formed formula has a beta normal form.

Many years later in a letter to Davis (c. 1965), Gödel said that &quot;he was, at the time of these [1934] lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions&quot;. By 1963–1964 Gödel would disavow Herbrand–Gödel recursion and the λ-calculus in favor of the Turing machine as the definition of &quot;algorithm&quot; or &quot;mechanical procedure&quot; or &quot;formal system&quot;.

A hypothesis leading to a natural law?: In late 1936 Alan Turing&#x27;s paper (also proving that the Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable) was delivered orally, but had not yet appeared in print. On the other hand, Emil Post&#x27;s 1936 paper had appeared and was certified independent of Turing&#x27;s work. Post strongly disagreed with Church&#x27;s &quot;identification&quot; of effective computability with the λ-calculus and recursion, stating:

Rather, he regarded the notion of &quot;effective calculability&quot; as merely a &quot;working hypothesis&quot; that might lead by inductive reasoning to a &quot;natural law&quot; rather than by &quot;a definition or an axiom&quot;. This idea was &quot;sharply&quot; criticized by Church.

Thus Post in his 1936 paper was also discounting Kurt Gödel&#x27;s suggestion to Church in 1934–1935 that the thesis might be expressed as an axiom or set of axioms.

Turing adds another definition, Rosser equates all three: Within just a short time, Turing&#x27;s 1936–1937 paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot; appeared. In it he stated another notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; with the introduction of his a-machines (now known as the Turing machine abstract computational model). And in a proof-sketch added as an &quot;Appendix&quot; to his 1936–1937 paper, Turing showed that the classes of functions defined by λ-calculus and Turing machines coincided. Church was quick to recognise how compelling Turing&#x27;s analysis was. In his review of Turing&#x27;s paper he made clear that Turing&#x27;s notion made &quot;the identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly defined) sense evident immediately&quot;.

In a few years (1939) Turing would propose, like Church and Kleene before him, that &quot;his&quot; formal definition of mechanical computing agent was the correct one. Thus, by 1939, both Church (1934) and Turing (1939) had individually proposed that their &quot;formal systems&quot; should be &quot;definitions&quot; of &quot;effective calculability&quot;; neither framed their statements as &quot;theses&quot;.

Rosser (1939) formally identified the three notions-as-definitions:

Kleene proposes &quot;Thesis I&quot;: This left the overt expression of a &quot;thesis&quot; to Kleene. In 1943 Kleene proposed his &quot;Thesis I&quot;:


The Church–Turing Thesis: Stephen Kleene, in &quot;Introduction To Metamathematics&quot;, finally goes on to formally name &quot;Church&#x27;s Thesis&quot; and &quot;Turing&#x27;s Thesis&quot;, using his theory of recursive realizability. Kleene having switched from presenting his work in the terminology of Church-Kleene lambda definability, to that of Gödel-Kleene recursiveness (partial recursive functions). In this transition, Kleene modified Gödel&#x27;s general recursive functions to allow for proofs of the unsolvability of problems in the Intuitionism of E. J. Brouwer. In his graduate textbook on logic, &quot;Church&#x27;s thesis&quot; is introduced and basic mathematical results are demonstrated to be unrealizable. Next, Kleene proceeds to present &quot;Turing&#x27;s thesis&quot;, where results are shown to be uncomputable, using his simplified derivation of a Turing machine based on the work of Emil Post. Both theses are proven equivalent by use of &quot;Theorem XXX&quot;.



Kleene, finally, uses for the first time the term the &quot;Church-Turing thesis&quot; in a section in which he helps to give clarifications to concepts in Alan Turing&#x27;s paper &quot;The Word Problem in Semi-Groups with Cancellation&quot;, as demanded in a critique from William Boone.

=== Later developments ===
An attempt to better understand the notion of &quot;effective computability&quot; led Robin Gandy (Turing&#x27;s student and friend) in 1980 to analyze &quot;machine&quot; computation (as opposed to human-computation acted out by a Turing machine). Gandy&#x27;s curiosity about, and analysis of, cellular automata (including Conway&#x27;s game of life), parallelism, and crystalline automata, led him to propose four &quot;principles (or constraints) ... which it is argued, any machine must satisfy&quot;. His most-important fourth, &quot;the principle of causality&quot; is based on the &quot;finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals; contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance&quot;. From these principles and some additional constraints—(1a) a lower bound on the linear dimensions of any of the parts, (1b) an upper bound on speed of propagation (the velocity of light), (2) discrete progress of the machine, and (3) deterministic behavior—he produces a theorem that &quot;What can be calculated by a device satisfying principles I–IV is computable.&quot;

In the late 1990s Wilfried Sieg analyzed Turing&#x27;s and Gandy&#x27;s notions of &quot;effective calculability&quot; with the intent of &quot;sharpening the informal notion, formulating its general features axiomatically, and investigating the axiomatic framework&quot;. In his 1997 and 2002 work Sieg presents a series of constraints on the behavior of a &quot;computor&quot;—&quot;a human computing agent who proceeds mechanically&quot;. These constraints reduce to:
*&quot;(B.1) (Boundedness) There is a fixed bound on the number of symbolic configurations a computor can immediately recognize.
*&quot;(B.2) (Boundedness) There is a fixed bound on the number of internal states a computor can be in.
*&quot;(L.1) (Locality) A computor can change only elements of an observed symbolic configuration.
*&quot;(L.2) (Locality) A computor can shift attention from one symbolic configuration to another one, but the new observed configurations must be within a bounded distance of the immediately previously observed configuration.
*&quot;(D) (Determinacy) The immediately recognizable (sub-)configuration determines uniquely the next computation step (and id [instantaneous description])&quot;; stated another way: &quot;A computor&#x27;s internal state together with the observed configuration fixes uniquely the next computation step and the next internal state.&quot;

The matter remains in active discussion within the academic community.

=== The thesis as a definition ===
The thesis can be viewed as nothing but an ordinary mathematical definition. Comments by Gödel on the subject suggest this view, e.g. &quot;the correct definition of mechanical computability was established beyond any doubt by Turing&quot;. The case for viewing the thesis as nothing more than a definition is made explicitly by Robert I. Soare, where it is also argued that Turing&#x27;s definition of computability is no less likely to be correct than the epsilon-delta definition of a continuous function.

==Success of the thesis==
Other formalisms (besides recursion, the λ-calculus, and the Turing machine) have been proposed for describing effective calculability/computability. Kleene (1952) adds to the list the functions &quot;&quot;reckonable&quot; in the system S1&quot; of Kurt Gödel 1936, and Emil Post&#x27;s (1943, 1946) &quot;&quot;canonical&quot; [also called &quot;normal&quot;] &quot;systems&quot;&quot;. In the 1950s Hao Wang and Martin Davis greatly simplified the one-tape Turing-machine model (see Post–Turing machine). Marvin Minsky expanded the model to two or more tapes and greatly simplified the tapes into &quot;up-down counters&quot;, which Melzak and Lambek further evolved into what is now known as the counter machine model. In the late 1960s and early 1970s researchers expanded the counter machine model into the register machine, a close cousin to the modern notion of the computer. Other models include combinatory logic and Markov algorithms. Gurevich adds the pointer machine model of Kolmogorov and Uspensky (1953, 1958): &quot;... they just wanted to ... convince themselves that there is no way to extend the notion of computable function.&quot;

All these contributions involve proofs that the models are computationally equivalent to the Turing machine; such models are said to be Turing complete. Because all these different attempts at formalizing the concept of &quot;effective calculability/computability&quot; have yielded equivalent results, it is now generally assumed that the Church–Turing thesis is correct. In fact, Gödel (1936) proposed something stronger than this; he observed that there was something &quot;absolute&quot; about the concept of &quot;reckonable in S1&quot;:

== Informal usage in proofs ==

Proofs in computability theory often invoke the Church–Turing thesis in an informal way to establish the computability of functions while avoiding the (often very long) details which would be involved in a rigorous, formal proof. To establish that a function is computable by Turing machine, it is usually considered sufficient to give an informal English description of how the function can be effectively computed, and then conclude &quot;by the Church–Turing thesis&quot; that the function is Turing computable (equivalently, partial recursive).

Dirk van Dalen gives the following example for the sake of illustrating this informal use of the Church–Turing thesis:

In order to make the above example completely rigorous, one would have to carefully construct a Turing machine, or λ-function, or carefully invoke recursion axioms, or at best, cleverly invoke various theorems of computability theory. But because the computability theorist believes that Turing computability correctly captures what can be computed effectively, and because an effective procedure is spelled out in English for deciding the set B, the computability theorist accepts this as proof that the set is indeed recursive.

== Variations ==
The success of the Church–Turing thesis prompted variations of the thesis to be proposed. For example, the physical Church–Turing thesis states: &quot;All physically computable functions are Turing-computable.&quot;

The Church–Turing thesis says nothing about the efficiency with which one model of computation can simulate another. It has been proved for instance that a (multi-tape) universal Turing machine only suffers a logarithmic slowdown factor in simulating any Turing machine.

A variation of the Church–Turing thesis addresses whether an arbitrary but &quot;reasonable&quot; model of computation can be efficiently simulated. This is called the feasibility thesis, also known as the (classical) complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis or the extended Church–Turing thesis, which is not due to Church or Turing, but rather was realized gradually in the development of complexity theory. It states: &quot;A probabilistic Turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.&quot; The word &#x27;efficiently&#x27; here means up to polynomial-time reductions. This thesis was originally called computational complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis by Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani (1997). The complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis, then, posits that all &#x27;reasonable&#x27; models of computation yield the same class of problems that can be computed in polynomial time. Assuming the conjecture that probabilistic polynomial time (BPP) equals deterministic polynomial time (P), the word &#x27;probabilistic&#x27; is optional in the complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis. A similar thesis, called the invariance thesis, was introduced by Cees F. Slot and Peter van Emde Boas. It states: Reasonable&#x27; machines can simulate each other within a polynomially bounded overhead in time and a constant-factor overhead in space.&quot; The thesis originally appeared in a paper at STOC&#x27;84, which was the first paper to show that polynomial-time overhead and constant-space overhead could be &quot;simultaneously&quot; achieved for a simulation of a Random Access Machine on a Turing machine.

If BQP is shown to be a strict superset of BPP, it would invalidate the complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis. In other words, there would be efficient quantum algorithms that perform tasks that do not have efficient probabilistic algorithms. This would not however invalidate the original Church–Turing thesis, since a quantum computer can always be simulated by a Turing machine, but it would invalidate the classical complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis for efficiency reasons. Consequently, the quantum complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis states: &quot;A quantum Turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation.&quot;

Eugene Eberbach and Peter Wegner claim that the Church–Turing thesis is sometimes interpreted too broadly,
stating &quot;Though [...] Turing machines express the behavior of algorithms, the broader assertion that algorithms precisely capture what can be computed is invalid&quot;. They claim that forms of computation not captured by the thesis are relevant today,
terms which they call super-Turing computation.

==Philosophical implications==
Philosophers have interpreted the Church–Turing thesis as having implications for the philosophy of mind. B. Jack Copeland states that it is an open empirical question whether there are actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine; furthermore, he states that it is an open empirical question whether any such processes are involved in the working of the human brain. There are also some important open questions which cover the relationship between the Church–Turing thesis and physics, and the possibility of hypercomputation. When applied to physics, the thesis has several possible meanings:

#The universe is equivalent to a Turing machine; thus, computing non-recursive functions is physically impossible. This has been termed the strong Church–Turing thesis, or Church–Turing–Deutsch principle, and is a foundation of digital physics.
#The universe is not equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e., the laws of physics are not Turing-computable), but incomputable physical events are not &quot;harnessable&quot; for the construction of a hypercomputer. For example, a universe in which physics involves random real numbers, as opposed to computable reals, would fall into this category.
#The universe is a hypercomputer, and it is possible to build physical devices to harness this property and calculate non-recursive functions. For example, it is an open question whether all quantum mechanical events are Turing-computable, although it is known that rigorous models such as quantum Turing machines are equivalent to deterministic Turing machines. (They are not necessarily efficiently equivalent; see above.) John Lucas and Roger Penrose have suggested that the human mind might be the result of some kind of quantum-mechanically enhanced, &quot;non-algorithmic&quot; computation.

There are many other technical possibilities which fall outside or between these three categories, but these serve to illustrate the range of the concept.

Philosophical aspects of the thesis, regarding both physical and biological computers, are also discussed in Odifreddi&#x27;s 1989 textbook on recursion theory.

== Non-computable functions ==

One can formally define functions that are not computable. A well-known example of such a function is the Busy Beaver function. This function takes an input &quot;n&quot; and returns the largest number of symbols that a Turing machine with &quot;n&quot; states can print before halting, when run with no input. Finding an upper bound on the busy beaver function is equivalent to solving the halting problem, a problem known to be unsolvable by Turing machines. Since the busy beaver function cannot be computed by Turing machines, the Church–Turing thesis states that this function cannot be effectively computed by any method.

Several computational models allow for the computation of (Church-Turing) non-computable functions. These are known as
hypercomputers.
Mark Burgin argues that super-recursive algorithms such as inductive Turing machines disprove the Church–Turing thesis. His argument relies on a definition of algorithm broader than the ordinary one, so that non-computable functions obtained from some inductive Turing machines are called computable. This interpretation of the Church–Turing thesis differs from the interpretation commonly accepted in computability theory, discussed above. The argument that super-recursive algorithms are indeed algorithms in the sense of the Church–Turing thesis has not found broad acceptance within the computability research community.

<doc id="6857" wikidata="Q192969" url="?curid=6857" title="Computer multitasking">
<text>In computing, multitasking is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks (also known as processes) over a certain period of time. New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units (CPUs) and main memory. Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This &quot;context switch&quot; may be initiated at fixed time intervals (pre-emptive multitasking), or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (cooperative multitasking).

Multitasking does not require parallel execution of multiple tasks at exactly the same time; instead, it allows more than one task to advance over a given period of time. Even on multiprocessor computers, multitasking allows many more tasks to be run than there are CPUs.

Multitasking is a common feature of computer operating systems since at least the 1960s. It allows more efficient use of the computer hardware; when a program is waiting for some external event such as a user input or an input/output transfer with a peripheral to complete, the central processor can still be used with another program. In a time-sharing system, multiple human operators use the same processor as if it was dedicated to their use, while behind the scenes the computer is serving many users by multitasking their individual programs. In multiprogramming systems, a task runs until it must wait for an external event or until the operating system&#x27;s scheduler forcibly swaps the running task out of the CPU. Real-time systems such as those designed to control industrial robots, require timely processing; a single processor might be shared between calculations of machine movement, communications, and user interface.

Often multitasking operating systems include measures to change the priority of individual tasks, so that important jobs receive more processor time than those considered less significant. Depending on the operating system, a task might be as large as an entire application program, or might be made up of smaller threads that carry out portions of the overall program.

A processor intended for use with multitasking operating systems may include special hardware to securely support multiple tasks, such as memory protection, and protection rings that ensure the supervisory software cannot be damaged or subverted by user-mode program errors.

The term &quot;multitasking&quot; has become an international term, as the same word is used in many other languages such as German, Italian, Dutch, Romanian, Czech, Danish and Norwegian.

== Multiprogramming ==
In the early days of computing, CPU time was expensive, and peripherals were very slow. When the computer ran a program that needed access to a peripheral, the central processing unit (CPU) would have to stop executing program instructions while the peripheral processed the data. This was usually very inefficient. Multiprogramming is a computing technique that enables multiple programs to be concurrently loaded and executed into a computer&#x27;s memory, allowing the CPU to switch between them swiftly. This optimizes CPU utilization by keeping it engaged with the execution of tasks, particularly useful when one program is waiting for I/O operations to complete.

The Bull Gamma 60, initially designed in 1957 and first released in 1960, was the first computer designed with multiprogramming in mind. Its architecture featured a central memory and a Program Distributor feeding up to twenty-five autonomous processing units with code and data, and allowing concurrent operation of multiple clusters.

Another such computer was the LEO III, first released in 1961. During batch processing, several different programs were loaded in the computer memory, and the first one began to run. When the first program reached an instruction waiting for a peripheral, the context of this program was stored away, and the second program in memory was given a chance to run. The process continued until all programs finished running.

The use of multiprogramming was enhanced by the arrival of virtual memory and virtual machine technology, which enabled individual programs to make use of memory and operating system resources as if other concurrently running programs were, for all practical purposes, nonexistent.

Multiprogramming gives no guarantee that a program will run in a timely manner. Indeed, the first program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users waiting at an interactive terminal, this was no problem: users handed in a deck of punched cards to an operator, and came back a few hours later for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait times when multiple batches were being processed.

== Cooperative multitasking ==
Early multitasking systems used applications that voluntarily ceded time to one another. This approach, which was eventually supported by many computer operating systems, is known today as cooperative multitasking. Although it is now rarely used in larger systems except for specific applications such as CICS or the JES2 subsystem, cooperative multitasking was once the only scheduling scheme employed by Microsoft Windows and classic Mac OS to enable multiple applications to run simultaneously. Cooperative multitasking is still used today on RISC OS systems.

As a cooperatively multitasked system relies on each process regularly giving up time to other processes on the system, one poorly designed program can consume all of the CPU time for itself, either by performing extensive calculations or by busy waiting; both would cause the whole system to hang. In a server environment, this is a hazard that makes the entire environment unacceptably fragile.

== Preemptive multitasking ==
Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee to each process a regular &quot;slice&quot; of operating time. It also allows the system to deal rapidly with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or another process. Operating systems were developed to take advantage of these hardware capabilities and run multiple processes preemptively. Preemptive multitasking was implemented in the PDP-6 Monitor and Multics in 1964, in OS/360 MFT in 1967, and in Unix in 1969, and was available in some operating systems for computers as small as DEC&#x27;s PDP-8; it is a core feature of all Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris and BSD with its derivatives, as well as modern versions of Windows.

At any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are waiting for input or output (called &quot;I/O bound&quot;), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU (&quot;CPU bound&quot;). In primitive systems, the software would often &quot;poll&quot;, or &quot;busywait&quot; while waiting for requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the system was not performing useful work. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, I/O bound processes could be &quot;blocked&quot;, or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution.

Possibly the earliest preemptive multitasking OS available to home users was Microware&#x27;s OS-9, available for computers based on the Motorola 6809 such as the TRS-80 Color Computer 2, with the operating system supplied by Tandy as an upgrade for disk-equipped systems. Sinclair QDOS on the Sinclair QL followed in 1984, but it was not a big success. Commodore&#x27;s Amiga was released the following year, offering a combination of multitasking and multimedia capabilities. Microsoft made preemptive multitasking a core feature of their flagship operating system in the early 1990s when developing Windows NT 3.1 and then Windows 95. In 1988 Apple offered A/UX as a UNIX System V-based alternative to the Classic Mac OS. In 2001 Apple switched to the NeXTSTEP-influenced Mac OS X.

A similar model is used in Windows 9x and the Windows NT family, where native 32-bit applications are multitasked preemptively. 64-bit editions of Windows, both for the x86-64 and Itanium architectures, no longer support legacy 16-bit applications, and thus provide preemptive multitasking for all supported applications.

== Real time ==
Another reason for multitasking was in the design of real-time computing systems, where there are a number of possibly unrelated external activities needed to be controlled by a single processor system. In such systems a hierarchical interrupt system is coupled with process prioritization to ensure that key activities were given a greater share of available process time.

== Multithreading ==
As multitasking greatly improved the throughput of computers, programmers started to implement applications as sets of cooperating processes (e. g., one process gathering input data, one process processing input data, one process writing out results on disk). This, however, required some tools to allow processes to efficiently exchange data.

Threads were born from the idea that the most efficient way for cooperating processes to exchange data would be to share their entire memory space. Thus, threads are effectively processes that run in the same memory context and share other resources with their parent processes, such as open files. Threads are described as &quot;lightweight processes&quot; because switching between threads does not involve changing the memory context.

While threads are scheduled preemptively, some operating systems provide a variant to threads, named &quot;fibers&quot;, that are scheduled cooperatively. On operating systems that do not provide fibers, an application may implement its own fibers using repeated calls to worker functions. Fibers are even more lightweight than threads, and somewhat easier to program with, although they tend to lose some or all of the benefits of threads on machines with multiple processors.

Some systems directly support multithreading in hardware.

== Memory protection ==
Essential to any multitasking system is to safely and effectively share access to system resources. Access to memory must be strictly managed to ensure that no process can inadvertently or deliberately read or write to memory locations outside the process&#x27;s address space. This is done for the purpose of general system stability and data integrity, as well as data security.

In general, memory access management is a responsibility of the operating system kernel, in combination with hardware mechanisms that provide supporting functionalities, such as a memory management unit (MMU). If a process attempts to access a memory location outside its memory space, the MMU denies the request and signals the kernel to take appropriate actions; this usually results in forcibly terminating the offending process. Depending on the software and kernel design and the specific error in question, the user may receive an access violation error message such as &quot;segmentation fault&quot;.

In a well designed and correctly implemented multitasking system, a given process can never directly access memory that belongs to another process. An exception to this rule is in the case of shared memory; for example, in the System V inter-process communication mechanism the kernel allocates memory to be mutually shared by multiple processes. Such features are often used by database management software such as PostgreSQL.

Inadequate memory protection mechanisms, either due to flaws in their design or poor implementations, allow for security vulnerabilities that may be potentially exploited by malicious software.

== Memory swapping ==
Use of a swap file or swap partition is a way for the operating system to provide more memory than is physically available by keeping portions of the primary memory in secondary storage. While multitasking and memory swapping are two completely unrelated techniques, they are very often used together, as swapping memory allows more tasks to be loaded at the same time. Typically, a multitasking system allows another process to run when the running process hits a point where it has to wait for some portion of memory to be reloaded from secondary storage.

== Programming ==
Various concurrent computing techniques are used to avoid potential problems caused by multiple tasks attempting to access the same resource.

Bigger systems were sometimes built with a central processor(s) and some number of I/O processors, a kind of asymmetric multiprocessing.

Over the years, multitasking systems have been refined. Modern operating systems generally include detailed mechanisms for prioritizing processes, while symmetric multiprocessing has introduced new complexities and capabilities.

<text>Chiang Kai-shek (31 October 18875 April 1975) was a Chinese politician, revolutionary, and general who led the Republic of China (ROC) from 1928 until his death in 1975. His government was based in mainland China until it was defeated in the Chinese Civil War by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949, after which he continued to lead the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan. Chiang served as leader of the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party and the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) from 1926 until his death, during which he was known as Generalissimo.

Born in Zhejiang, Chiang received a military education in China and Japan and joined Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Tongmenghui organization in 1908. After the 1911 Revolution, he was a founding member of the KMT and head of the Whampoa Military Academy from 1924. After Sun&#x27;s death in 1925, Chiang became leader of the party and commander-in-chief of the NRA, and from 1926 to 1928 led the Northern Expedition, which nominally reunified China under a Nationalist government based in Nanjing. The KMT–CCP alliance broke down in 1927 as Chiang massacred the communists in Shanghai, starting the Chinese Civil War. Chiang sought to modernise and unify the ROC during the Nanjing decade, although hostilities with the CCP continued. After Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria in 1931, his government tried to avoid a war while pursuing economic and social reconstruction. In 1936, Chiang was kidnapped by his generals in the Xi&#x27;an Incident and forced to form an anti-Japanese Second United Front with the CCP, and between 1937 and 1945 led China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, mostly from the wartime capital of Chongqing. As the leader of a major Allied power, he attended the 1943 Cairo Conference to discuss the terms for Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, including the return of Taiwan, where he suppressed the February 28 uprising in 1947. 

When World War II ended, the civil war with the CCP (led by Mao Zedong) resumed. In 1949, Chiang&#x27;s government was defeated and retreated to Taiwan, where he imposed martial law and the White Terror, a campaign of mass political repression; they lasted until 1987 and 1992, respectively. Beginning in 1948, he was re-elected five times by the same Eternal Parliament with six-year terms as President of the ROC, the head of a de facto one-party state, for 25 years till his death. Chiang presided over land reform, economic growth, and crises in the Taiwan Strait in 1954–1955 and again in 1958. He was considered the legitimate leader of China by the United Nations until 1971, when the ROC&#x27;s seat was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. After Chiang&#x27;s death in 1975, he was succeeded as leader of the KMT by his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who was elected president in following terms by the same parliament since 1978.

Chiang is a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with unifying the nation and ending the century of humiliation, leading the resistance against Japan, fostering economic development and promoting Chinese culture in contrast to Mao’s Cultural Revolution. He is also credited with protecting the national treasures from the Forbidden City during the wars with Japan and the CCP, eventually bringing them to Taiwan, where he established the National Palace Museum. Critics fault him for his early pacifism toward Japan&#x27;s occupation of Manchuria, flooding of the Yellow River, cronyism and corruption with the four big families, and his right-wing dictatorship on both mainland China and Taiwan.

==Names==
Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. The name inscribed in the genealogical records of his family is Chiang Chou-t‘ai (). This so-called &quot;register name&quot; () is the one by which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he was married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the register name in conversation with people outside of the family. The concept of a &quot;real&quot; or original name is/was not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world. In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their children. In the meantime, they used a &quot;milk name&quot; (), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family. So the name that Chiang received at birth was Chiang Jui-yüan ().

In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to Ningbo as a student, and chose a &quot;school name&quot; (). This was the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as a person grew older, younger generations would use one of the courtesy names instead). Colloquially, the school name is called &quot;big name&quot; (), whereas the &quot;milk name&quot; is known as the &quot;small name&quot; (). The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Chih-ch‘ing (, which means &quot;purity of aspirations&quot;). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as Chiang Chih-ch‘ing . This is the name by which Sun Yat-sen knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in Kwangtung in the 1910s.

In 1912, when Chiang was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek () as a pen name for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: &quot;Voice of the Army&quot; (). &quot;Jieshi&quot; is the pinyin romanization of this name, based on Standard Chinese, but the most recognized romanized rendering is &quot;Kai-shek&quot; which is in Cantonese romanization. Because the Republic of China was based in Canton (a Cantonese-speaking area), Chiang (who never spoke Cantonese but was a native Wu speaker) became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanisation of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in Wade–Giles.

&quot;Kai-shek&quot; soon became Chiang&#x27;s courtesy name (). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the &quot;I Ching&quot;; , is the beginning of line 2 of Hexagram 16, &quot;&quot;. Others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generational line, while the second character of his courtesy name &quot;shih&quot; (—meaning &quot;stone&quot;) suggests the second character of his &quot;register name&quot; &quot;tai&quot; (—the famous Mount Tai). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.

Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to Sun Yat-sen, he changed his name from Chiang Chih-ch‘ing to Chiang Chung-cheng (). By adopting the name Chung-cheng, he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who is known among Chinese as Chung-shan (—meaning &quot;central mountain&quot;), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the legitimate heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. It was readily accepted by members of the Kuomintang, and is the name under which Chiang is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to &quot;Chung-cheng&quot; only. Many public places in Taiwan are named Chungcheng after Chiang. For many years passengers arriving at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the &quot;Chung Cheng International Airport&quot;. Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang&#x27;s memory in Taipei, known in English as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was named &quot;Chung Cheng Memorial Hall&quot; in Chinese. In Singapore, Chung Cheng High School was named after him.

His name is also written in the free area of the Republic of China as &quot;The Late President Honorable Chiang&quot; (), where the one-character-wide space in front of his name known as Nuo tai shows respect. He is often called &quot;Honorable Chiang&quot;.

The &quot;Chiang Kai-shek&quot; in this article is spelled using a Cantonese transliteration he adopted as opposed to Hanyu Pinyin, though &quot;pinyin &quot;was adopted by the Republic of China government in 2009 as its official romanization.
== Early life ==
Chiang was born on 31 October 1887, in Hsikow, a town in Fenghua, Zhejiang, China, about west of central Ningbo. He was born into a family of Wu Chinese-speaking people with their ancestral home—a concept important in Chinese society—in Heqiao, a town in Yixing, Jiangsu, about southwest of central Wuxi and from the shores of Lake Tai. He was the third child and second son of his father (also Chiang Su-an; 1842–1895; ) and the first child of his father&#x27;s third wife (1863–1921; ) who were members of a prosperous family of salt merchants. Chiang&#x27;s father died when he was eight, and he wrote of his mother as the &quot;embodiment of Confucian virtues&quot;. The young Chiang was inspired throughout his youth by the realization that the reputation of an honored family rested upon his shoulders. He was a naughty child. At a young age he was interested in the military. As he grew older, Chiang became more aware of the issues that surrounded him and in his speech to the Kuomintang in 1945 said:

In early 1906, Chiang cut off his queue, the required hairstyle of men during the Ch‘ing dynasty, and had it sent home from school, shocking the people in his hometown.

==Education in Japan==

Chiang grew up at a time in which military defeats, natural disasters, famines, revolts, unequal treaties and civil wars had left the Manchu-dominated Ch‘ing dynasty unstable and in debt. Successive demands of the Western powers and Japan since the Opium War had left China owing millions of taels of silver. During his first visit to Japan to pursue a military career from April 1906 to later that year, he describes himself as having strong nationalistic feelings with a desire, among other things, to &#x27;expel the Manchu Ch‘ing and to restore China&#x27;.
 In a 1969 speech, Chiang related a story about his boat trip to Japan at nineteen years old. Another passenger on the ship, a Chinese fellow student who was in the habit of spitting on the floor, was chided by a Chinese sailor who said that Japanese people did not spit on the floor, but instead would spit into a handkerchief. Chiang used the story as an example of how the common man in 1969 Taiwan had not developed the spirit of public sanitation that Japan had. Chiang decided to pursue a military career. He began his military training at the Baoding Military Academy in 1906, the same year Japan left its bimetallic currency standard, devaluing the Japanese yen. He left for Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, a preparatory school for the Imperial Japanese Army Academy intended for Chinese students, in 1907. There, he came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the Manchu-dominated Qing dynasty and to set up a Han-dominated Chinese republic. He befriended Chen Qimei, and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the Tungmenghui, an important revolutionary brotherhood of the era. Finishing his military schooling at Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, Chiang served in the Imperial Japanese Army from 1909 to 1911.

==Returning to China==
After learning of the Wuchang uprising, Chiang returned to China in 1911, intending to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor Chen Qimei, as one of Chen&#x27;s chief lieutenants. In early 1912 a dispute arose between Chen and Tao Chengzhang, an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen. Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital, but Chiang discovered him there. Chen dispatched assassins. Chiang may not have taken part in the assassination, but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble. Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang&#x27;s already legendary temper, regarding such bellicosity as useful in a military leader.

Chiang&#x27;s friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai&#x27;s criminal syndicate (the Green Gang headed by Du Yuesheng and Huang Jinrong). During Chiang&#x27;s time in Shanghai, the Shanghai International Settlement police observed him and eventually charged him with various felonies. These charges never resulted in a trial, and Chiang was never jailed.

Chiang became a founding member of the Nationalist Party (a forerunner of the KMT) after the success (February 1912) of the 1911 Revolution. After the takeover of the Republican government by Yuan Shikai and the failed Second Revolution in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the Shanghai International Settlement. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city&#x27;s underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng. On 18 May 1916 agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s political career reached its lowest point during this time—most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.

== Establishing the Kuomintang&#x27;s position ==
In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to Canton, where Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; without arms or money, he was soon expelled from the city and exiled again to Shanghai, only to return to Canton with mercenary help in 1920. After his return, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Canton Governor Chen Chiung-ming, who wanted to implement a federalist system with Canton as a model province. On 16 June 1922 Ye Ju, a general of Chen&#x27;s whom Sun had attempted to exile, led an assault on Canton&#x27;s Presidential Palace. Sun had already fled to the naval yard and boarded the SS &quot;Haichi&quot;, but his wife narrowly evaded shelling and rifle-fire as she fled. They met on the SS &quot;Yungfeng&quot;, where Chiang joined them as soon as he could return from Shanghai, where he was ritually mourning his mother&#x27;s death. For about 50 days, Chiang stayed with Sun, protecting and caring for him and earning his lasting trust. They abandoned their attacks on Chen on 9 August, taking a British ship to Hong Kong and traveling to Shanghai by steamer.

Sun regained control of Canton in early 1923, again with the help of mercenaries from Yunnan and of the Comintern. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year Sun sent Chiang to Moscow, where he spent three months studying the Soviet political and military system. There Chiang met Leon Trotsky and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Chiang Ching-Kuo, to study in Russia. After his father&#x27;s split from the First United Front in 1927, Ching-Kuo was retained there, as a hostage until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, &quot;It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.&quot;

When Chiang returned in 1924 Sun appointed him Commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy. Chiang resigned after one month in disagreement with Sun&#x27;s close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun&#x27;s demand, and accepted Chou En-lai as his political commissar. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself.

Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist Tien-ti-hui fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.

==Rising power==
Sun Yat-sen died on 12 March 1925, creating a power vacuum in the Kuomintang. A contest ensued among Wang Ching-wei, Liao Chung-k‘ai, and Hu Han-min. In August, Liao was assassinated and Hu was arrested for his connections to the murderers. Wang Ching-wei, who had succeeded Sun as chairman of the Canton regime, seemed ascendant but was forced into exile by Chiang following the Canton Coup. The , renamed the &quot;Chung-shan&quot; in Sun&#x27;s honour, had appeared off Changzhou, the location of the Whampoa Academy, on apparently-falsified orders and amid a series of unusual phone calls trying to ascertain Chiang&#x27;s location. He initially considered fleeing Guangdong and even booked passage on a Japanese steamer but then decided to use his military connections to declare martial law on 20 March 1926 and to crack down on Communist and Soviet influence over the National Revolutionary Army, the military academy, and the party. The right wing of the party supported him, and Joseph Stalin, anxious to maintain Soviet influence in the area, had his lieutenants agree to Chiang&#x27;s demands on a reduced Communist presence in the KMT leadership in exchange for certain other concessions. The rapid replacement of leadership enabled Chiang to effectively end civilian oversight of the military after 15 May, though his authority was somewhat limited by the army&#x27;s own regional composition and divided loyalties.

On 5 June 1926, he was named commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army [NRA] and, on 27 July, he finally launched Sun&#x27;s long-delayed Northern Expedition, aimed at conquering the northern warlords and bringing China together under the KMT.

The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was the returned Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take Wuhan; Bai Chongxi&#x27;s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take Nanjing before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of Chinese Communists and advised by Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin, Wang declared the national government as having moved to Wuhan.

In 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with &quot;the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of &#x27;Father of our Chinese Republic&#x27;. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position&quot;. He asked Chen Guofu to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with Yeung Ku-wan as president, in the place of honor, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society. When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative, &quot;The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position&quot;.

On 12 April 1927, Chiang carried out a purge of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the &quot;White Terror&quot;. During April, more than people were killed in Shanghai. The killings drove most Communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside, where the KMT was less powerful. In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people died across China in the anti-communist suppression campaigns, executed by the KMT. One of the most famous quotes from Chiang (during that time) was, that he would rather mistakenly kill 1,000 innocent people, than allow one Communist to escape. Some estimates claim the White Terror in China took millions of lives, most of them in rural areas. No concrete number can be verified. Chiang allowed Soviet agent and advisor Mikhail Borodin and Soviet general Vasily Blücher (Galens) to &quot;escape&quot; to safety after the purge.

The NRA formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the Jinan incident of 1928.

Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including Hu Hanmin, Chiang&#x27;s expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the Chinese Civil War. Wang Jingwei&#x27;s National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord (Li Zongren of Guangxi). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. However, the cracks between Chiang and Hu&#x27;s traditionally Right-Wing KMT faction, the Western Hills Group, began to show soon after the cleansing against the communists, and Chiang later imprisoned Hu.

Though Chiang had consolidated the power of the KMT in Nanjing, it was still necessary to capture Beijing to claim the legitimacy needed for international recognition. Beijing was taken in June 1928, from an alliance of the warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan moved in and captured Beiping on behalf of his new allegiance after the death of Zhang Zuolin in 1928. His successor, Zhang Xueliang, accepted the authority of the KMT leadership, and the Northern Expedition officially concluded, completing Chiang&#x27;s nominal unification of China and ending the Warlord Era.

After the Northern Expedition ended in 1928, Yan, Feng, Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui broke off relations with Chiang shortly after a demilitarization conference in 1929, and together they formed an anti-Chiang coalition to openly challenge the legitimacy of the Nanjing government. In the Central Plains War, they were defeated.

Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen. In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun&#x27;s brother-in-law. He had married Soong Mei-ling, the younger sister of Soong Ching-ling, Sun&#x27;s widow, on 1 December 1927. Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling&#x27;s mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of Christianity. He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong&#x27;s Methodist church. Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings.

Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a mausoleum, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.
In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the &quot;Red General&quot;. Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang. At Moscow, Sun Yat-sen University portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls; and, in the Soviet May Day parades that year, Chiang&#x27;s portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and other Communist leaders. The United States consulate and other Westerners in Shanghai were concerned about the approach of &quot;Red General&quot; Chiang as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the Northern Expedition.

==Rule==


Having gained control of China, Chiang&#x27;s party remained surrounded by defeated warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On 10 October 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles. As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him &quot;generalissimo&quot;.

According to Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s plans, the KMT was to rebuild China in three steps: military rule, political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China&#x27;s fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang&#x27;s rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be &quot;political tutelage&quot; in Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.

From 1928 to 1937, known as the Nanjing decade, various aspects of foreign imperialism, concessions and privileges in China were moderated by diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems and attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Efforts were made to improve education standards, and the national academy of sciences, Academia Sinica, was founded. In an effort to unify Chinese society, the New Life Movement was launched to encourage Confucian moral values and personal discipline. &quot;Guoyu&quot; (&quot;national language&quot;) was promoted as the official language, and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) was used to encourage a sense of Chinese nationalism in a way that had not been possible when the nation lacked an effective central government. Under that context, the Chinese Rural Reconstruction Movement was implemented by some social activists who graduated as professors of the United States with tangible but limited progress in modernizing the tax, infrastructural, economic, cultural, and educational equipment and the mechanisms of rural regions. The social activists actively co-ordinated with the local governments in the towns and villages since the early 1930s. However, the policy was subsequently neglected and canceled by Chiang&#x27;s government because of rampant wars and the lack of resources after the Japanese War and the civil war.

Despite being a conservative, Chiang supported modernization policies such as scientific advancement, universal education, and women&#x27;s rights. The Kuomintang supported women&#x27;s suffrage and education and the abolition of polygamy and foot binding. Under Chiang&#x27;s leadership, the Republic of China government also enacted a women&#x27;s quota in the parliament, with reserved seats for women. During the Nanjing Decade, average Chinese citizens received education that they had been denied by the dynasties. That increased the literacy rate across China and also promoted the ideals of Tridemism of democracy, republicanism, science, constitutionalism, and Chinese nationalism based on the Dang Guo of the KMT.

Any successes that the Nationalists achieved, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. Many of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, but much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened-but
-undefeated warlords, landlords, and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The Central Plains War alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost casualties on both sides. In 1931, Hu Hanmin, an old supporter of Chiang, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang&#x27;s position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under house arrest, but Hu was released after national condemnation. Hu then left Nanjing and supported a rival government in Canton. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu&#x27;s Guangdong government and Chiang&#x27;s Nationalist government.
Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the Communists remained Chiang&#x27;s dream. After he had assembled his forces in Jiangxi, Chiang led his armies against the newly established Chinese Soviet Republic. With help from foreign military advisers such as Max Bauer and Alexander von Falkenhausen, Chiang&#x27;s Fifth Campaign finally surrounded the Chinese Red Army in 1934. The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the Long March during which Mao rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Chinese Communist Party.

Some academics and historians have classified Chiang&#x27;s rule as fascist. The New Life Movement, initiated by Chiang, was based upon Confucianism mixed with Christianity, nationalism, and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. Frederic Wakeman argued that the New Life Movement was &quot;Confucian fascism&quot;. Chiang also sponsored the creation of the Blue Shirts Society, in conscious imitation of the Blackshirts in the Italian Fascist Party and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; of the Nazi Party. Its ideology was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China and to crush communism. Close ties with Nazi Germany also gave the Nationalist government access to German military and economic assistance during the mid-1930s. In a 1935 speech, Chiang stated that &quot;fascism is what China now most needs&quot; and described fascism as the stimulant for a declining society. Mao once derogatorily compared Chiang to Adolf Hitler, referring to him as the &quot;Führer of China&quot;. Sino-German relations rapidly deteriorated as Germany grew closer to Japan and almost completely broke down when Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937, which Germany failed to mediate. However, China did not declare war on Germany, Italy, or even Japan until after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.

Chinese Communists and many conservative anti-communist writers have argued that Chiang was pro-capitalist based on the alliance thesis (the alliance between Chiang and the capitalists to purge the communist and the leftist elements in Shanghai, as well as in the resulting civil war). However, Chiang also antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai by often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for government use even while he denounced and fought against communists. Critics have called that &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot;. Historian Parks M. Coble argues that the phrase &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot; is too simplistic to adequately characterize this phenomenon. Instead, he says, the regime weakened all social forces so that the government could pursue policies without being responsible nor responsive to any outside political groups. By defeating any potential challenge to its power, government officials could amass sizable fortunes. With that motive, Chiang cracked down pro-communist worker and peasant organizations, as well as rich Shanghai capitalists. Chiang also continued the anti-capitalist rhetoric of Sun Yat-sen and directed the Kuomintang media to attack the capitalists and capitalism openly. He supported government-controlled industries instead. Coble says that the rhetoric had no impact on governmental policy and that its use was to prevent the capitalists from claiming legitimacy within the party or society and to control them and their wealth.

Authority within the Nationalist government ultimately lay with Chiang. All major policy changes on military, diplomatic, or economic issues required his approval. According to historian Odd Arne Westad, &quot;no other leader within the [KMT] had the authority to force through even the simplest decisions. The practical power of high-ranking officials like ministers or the head of the Executive Yuan was more closely tied to their relationship with Chiang than with the formal authority of their position. Chiang created multiple layers of power in his administration which he sometimes played off against each other to prevent individuals or cliques from gathering power that could oppose his authority.

Contrary to the critique that Chiang was highly corrupt, he was not involved in corruption himself. However his wife, Soong Mei-ling, ignored her family&#x27;s involvement in corruption. The Soong family embezzled $20 million in the course of the 1930s and the 1940s when the Nationalist government&#x27;s revenues were less than $30 million per year. The Soong family&#x27;s eldest son, T.V. Soong, was the Chinese premier and finance minister, and the eldest daughter, Soong Ai-ling, was the wife of Kung Hsiang-hsi, the wealthiest man in China. The second daughter, Soong Ching-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China&#x27;s founding father. The youngest daughter, Soong Mei-ling, married Chiang in 1927, and following the marriage, both families became intimately connected, which created the &quot;Soong dynasty&quot; and the &quot;Four Families&quot;. However, Soong was also credited for her campaign for women&#x27;s rights in China, including her attempts to improve the education, culture, and social benefits of Chinese women. Critics have said that the &quot;Four Families&quot; monopolized the regime and looted it. The US sent considerable aid to the Nationalist government but soon realized the widespread corruption. Military supplies that were sent appeared on the black market. Significant sums of money that had been transmitted through T. V. Soong, China&#x27;s finance minister, soon disappeared. President Truman famously referred to the Nationalist leaders, &quot;They&#x27;re thieves, every damn one of them.&quot; He also said, &quot;They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it&#x27;s invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.&quot; Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling lived luxurious lifestyles and held millions in property, clothes, art, and jewelry. Soong Ai-ling and Soong Mei-ling were also the two richest women in China. Despite living a luxurious life for almost her entire life, Soong Mei-ling left only a $120,000 inheritance, and the reason is that according to her niece, that she donated most of her wealth when she was still alive. Chiang, requiring support, tolerated corruption with people in his inner circles, as well as high-ranking nationalist officials, but not of lower-ranking officers. In 1934, he ordered seven military officers who embezzled state property to be shot. In another case, several division commanders pleaded with Chiang to pardon a criminal officer, but as soon as the division commanders had left, Chiang ordered him shot. The deputy editor and chief reporter at the Central Daily News, Lu Keng, made headline international news by exposing the corruption of two senior officials, Kong Xiangxi (H. H. Kung) and T. V. Soong. Chiang then ordered a thorough investigation of the Central Daily News to find the source. However, Lu, risked execution by refusing to comply and protecting his journalists. Chiang wanting to avoid an international response and so jailed Lu instead. Chiang realized the widespread problems that corruption was creating and so he undertook several anti-corruption campaigns before and after World War II with varying success. Before the war, both campaigns, the Nanjing Decade Cleanup of 1927–1930 and the Wartime Reform Movement of 1944–1947, failed. After the World War II and the Civil War, both campaigns, the Kuomintang Reconstruction of 1950–1952 and the Governmental Rejuvenation of 1969–1973, succeeded.

Chiang, who viewed all of the foreign great powers with suspicion, wrote in a letter that they &quot;all have it in their minds to promote the interests of their own respective countries at the cost of other nations&quot; and saw it as hypocritical for any of them to condemn one another&#x27;s foreign policy. He used diplomatic persuasion on the United States, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union to regain lost Chinese territories, as he viewed all foreign powers as imperialists that were attempting to exploit China.

===First phase of Chinese Civil War===

During April 1931, Chiang Kai-shek attended a national leadership conference in Nanjing with Zhang Xueliang and General Ma Fuxiang during which Chiang and Zhang dauntlessly upheld that Manchuria was part of China in the face of the Japanese invasion. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterward and adopted the slogan &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance.&quot; However, his policy of avoiding a frontal war against Japan and prioritizing anti-communist suppression was widely unpopular and provoked nationwide protests. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the Communists, Japan launched an advance on Shanghai and bombarded Nanjing. That disrupted Chiang&#x27;s offensives against the Communists for a time, but it was the northern factions of Hu Hanmin&#x27;s Guangdong government (notably the 19th Route Army) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during the skirmish. Brought into the NRA immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army&#x27;s career under Chiang would be cut short by being disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies. 

In December 1936, Chiang flew to Xi&#x27;an to co-ordinate a major assault on the Red Army and the CPC, which had retreated into Yan&#x27;an. However, Chiang&#x27;s allied commander Zhang Xueliang, whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of Manchuria had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On 12 December, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals, headed by Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the Xi&#x27;an Incident. They forced Chiang into making a &quot;Second United Front&quot; with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest, and the generals who had assisted him were executed. The Second United Front had a commitment by Chiang that was nominal at best and was all but dissolved in 1941.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===

The Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in July 1937, and in August, Chiang sent of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to defend Shanghai. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his Whampoa-trained officers. Although Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japan&#x27;s claims that it could conquer China in three months and also demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese resulting in the Nanjing Massacre. Chiang moved the government inland first to Wuhan and later to Chongqing.

Having lost most of China&#x27;s economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretched the Japanese supply lines, and bogged down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of scorched-earth tactics, which resulted in many civilian deaths. During the Nationalists&#x27; retreat from Zhengzhou, the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the National Revolutionary Army to delay the Japanese advance, and the subsequent 1938 Yellow River flood killed 800,000 to one million people. Four million Chinese were left homeless. Chiang and the KMT were slow to provide disaster relief.

After heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied Wuhan in the fall of 1938, and the Nationalists retreated farther inland to Chongqing. En route to Chongqing, the Nationalist Army intentionally started the Changsha Fire as a part of its scorched-earth policy. The fire destroyed much of the city, killed 20,000 civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. An organizational error (it was claimed) caused the fire to be started without any warning to the residents of the city. The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.

In 1939, the Muslim leaders Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Ma Fuliang were sent by Chiang to several Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Turkey, and Syria, to gain support for the war against Japan and to express his support for Muslims.

The Japanese, controlling the puppet state of Manchukuo and much of China&#x27;s eastern seaboard, appointed Wang Jingwei as a puppet ruler of the occupied Chinese territories around Nanjing. Wang named himself President of the Executive Yuan and chairman, and he led a surprisingly large minority of anti-Chiang and anti-Communist Chinese against his old comrades. He died in 1944, a year before the end of World War II.

The Hui Xidaotang sect pledged allegiance to the Kuomintang after the party&#x27;s rise to power, and Hui general Bai Chongxi acquainted Chiang with the Xidaotang Juaozhu Ma Mingren in 1941 in Chongqing.

In 1942 Chiang went on tour in northwestern China in Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Qinghai, where he met the Muslim Generals Ma Buqing and Ma Bufang. He also met the Muslim Generals Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui separately.

A border crisis erupted with Tibet in 1942. Under orders from Chiang, Ma Bufang repaired Yushu Airport to prevent Tibetan separatists from seeking independence. Chiang also ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942. Ma Bufang complied and moved several thousand troops to the Tibetan border. Chiang also threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment if they worked with the Japanese. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. He also constantly attacked the Labrang Monastery.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the opening of the Pacific War, China became one of the Allies. During and after World War II, Chiang and his American-educated wife, Soong Mei-ling, known in the United States as &quot;Madame Chiang&quot;, held the support of the American China Lobby, which saw in them the hope of a Christian and democratic China. Chiang was even named the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the China war zone. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1942.

General Joseph Stilwell, an American military advisor to Chiang during World War II, strongly criticized Chiang and his generals for what Stilwell saw as their incompetence and corruption. In 1944, the United States Army Air Corps commenced Operation Matterhorn to bomb Japan&#x27;s steel industry from bases to be constructed in mainland China. That was meant to fulfill US President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s promise to Chiang to begin bombing operations against Japan by November 1944. However, Chiang&#x27;s subordinates refused to take air base construction seriously until enough capital had been delivered to permit embezzlement on a massive scale. Stilwell estimated that at least half of the $100 million spent on construction of air bases was embezzled by Nationalist party officials.

The poor performance of Nationalist forces during the Japanese Ichigo campaign contributed to the view that Chiang was incompetent. Their poor performance irreparably damaged Chiang and the Nationalists in the view of the Roosevelt administration. Chiang argued that the United States, and Stillwell in particular, were at fault for the failure because they had moved too many Chinese troops into the Burma campaign.

After the Japanese surrender, Chiang had to rely on the assistance of the United States in order to transport his troops to regain control of occupied areas. Non-Chinese found the behavior of these troops and accompanying officials as undercutting Nationalist legitimacy, as Nationalist forces engaged in a &quot;botched liberation&quot; characterized by corruption, looting, and inefficiency.

Chiang tried to balance the influence of the Soviets and the Americans in China during the war. He first told the Americans that they would be welcome in talks between the Soviet Union and China and then secretly told the Soviets that the Americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered. Chiang also used American support and military power in China against Soviet ambitions to dominate the talks. That stopped the Soviets from taking full advantage of the situation in China by the threat of American military action against them.

Chiang&#x27;s Nationalist government made laws on abortion in China more restrictive during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1945, Chiang adopted a eugenic population policy that was intended to promote hybrid vigor by encouraging intermarriage between whites and Chinese to combine European fair skin with superior Chinese intelligence. Although adopted, the policy was never successfully implemented.

=== French Indochina ===
President Roosevelt, through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that he preferred for the French not to reacquire French Indochina (now Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang control of all of Indochina. It was said that Chiang replied in English, &quot;Under no circumstances!&quot;

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han were sent by Chiang to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and the Chinese forces remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned. The Chinese used the VNQDD, the Vietnamese branch of the Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and to put pressure on their opponents. Chiang threatened the French with war in response to maneuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s forces against each other and forced them to come to a peace agreement. In February 1946, he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and to renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for the Chinese withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region. After France&#x27;s agreement to those demands, 20,000 French soldiers landed in Haiphong, North Vietnam, on 6 March 1946, under the leadership of general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, followed by the withdrawal of Chinese troops which began in March 1946.

===Ryukyus===
According to Republic of China&#x27;s notes of a dinner meeting during the Cairo Conference in 1943, Roosevelt asked Chiang whether China desired the Ryukyu Islands as territories restored from Japan. Chiang said he would be agreeable to joint occupation and administration by China and the United States.

===Second phase of Chinese Civil War===

====Treatment and use of Japanese soldiers====

Because of Chiang&#x27;s focus on his communist opponents, he allowed some Japanese forces and forces from the Japanese puppet regimes to remain on duty in occupied areas in an effort to prevent the communists from accepting their surrender.

American troops and weapons soon bolstered the Nationalist forces, which allowed them to reclaim the cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control. Chiang implemented his war-time phrase &quot;repay evil with good&quot; and made a huge effort to protect elements of the Japanese invading army. In 1949, a Nationalist court acquitted General Okamura Yasuji, the chief commander of Japanese forces in China, of alleged war crimes, retaining him as an advisor. Nationalist China repeatedly intervened to protect Okamura from repeated American requests to testify at the Tokyo war crimes trial.

Many top Nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers. The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, General Okamura had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang&#x27;s staff. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer but declined only because he knew that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture. Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some non-commissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps. The Japanese in China came to regard Chiang as a magnanimous figure to whom many of them owed their lives and livelihoods; that fact was attested by both Nationalist and Communist sources.

==== Conditions during Chinese Civil War ====

Chiang did not de-mobilize his troops after the defeat of the Japanese, instead remaining on a war footing to prepare for the resumption of civil war against the Communists. This further strained the economy of Nationalist era China, worsening deficits. A significant body of evidence suggests that much of the Nationalist military budget in this period was wasted. One factor in military budget waste included that troop counts were inflated above actual head counts and that officers embezzled the salaries of the non-existent soldiers. Another was the power of military commanders over local branches of the Bank of China, which they could require to provide currency outside of the normal budget process.

Although Chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader, his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and hyperinflation. In his diary in June 1948, Chiang wrote that the KMT had failed not because of external enemies but because of rot from within. The war had severely weakened the Nationalists, and the Communists were strengthened by their popular land reform policies and by a rural population that supported and trusted them. The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.

After World War II, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and the Communist leader, Mao Zedong, in Chongqing. Concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang&#x27;s government throughout his rule made the US government limit aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948 despite the fighting against Mao&#x27;s Red Army. Alleged infiltration of the US government by CCP agents may have also played a role in the suspension of American aid.

Chiang&#x27;s right-hand man, the secret police chief Dai Li, was anti-American and anti-Communist and a self-declared fascist. Dai ordered Kuomintang agents to spy on American officers. Earlier, Dai had been involved with the Blue Shirts Society, a fascist-inspired paramilitary group within the Kuomintang that wanted to expel Western and Japanese imperialists, crush the Communists, and eliminate feudalism. Dai Li died in a plane crash, which some suspect to be an assassination orchestrated by Chiang; however, the assassination was also rumoured to have been arranged by the American Office of Strategic Services because of Dai&#x27;s anti-Americanism and since it happened on an American plane.

==== Conflict with Li Zongren ====
A new constitution was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was elected by the National Assembly as the first President of the Republic of China on 20 May 1948. That marked the beginning of what was termed the &quot;democratic constitutional government&quot; period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government as legitimate. Chiang resigned as president on 21 January 1949, as Nationalist forces suffered terrible losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang&#x27;s resignation, vice-president Li Zongren became China&#x27;s acting president.

Shortly after Chiang&#x27;s resignation, the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the Nationalists&#x27; virtual surrender. Li tried to negotiate milder terms to end the civil war but had no success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao&#x27;s terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949 that warned that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days. Li refused.

Li&#x27;s attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang&#x27;s supporters and were generally unsuccessful. Taylor has noted that Chiang had a superstitious belief in holding Manchuria. After the Nationalist military defeat in the province, Chiang lost faith in winning the war and started to prepare for the retreat to Taiwan. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of and moving to Taiwan US$200 million of gold and US dollars that belonged to the central government. Li desperately needed them to cover the government&#x27;s soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to Guangdong and instead expressed his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.
The former warlord Yan Xishan, who had fled to Nanjing only one month earlier, quickly insinuated himself within the Li-Chiang rivalry and attempted to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang&#x27;s request, Yan visited Li to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while he talked of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and he warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangdong. Li agreed to return if Chiang surrendered most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and Chiang stopped overriding Li&#x27;s authority. After Yan communicated those demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.

In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both supporters and opponents of Chiang. Li&#x27;s first choice of premier was Chu Cheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile for his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan jas rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By then, Yan was well known for his adaptability, and Chiang welcomed his appointment.

The conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li&#x27;s return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money that was issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless. Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang, rather than Li. The inability of Li to co-ordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong. He hoped that he could concentrate all available defenses on the smaller area, which would be more easily defensible. The object of Li&#x27;s strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.

==== Final Communist advance ====

Chiang opposed Li&#x27;s plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops who were still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang&#x27;s other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang&#x27;s intransigence Li began ousting Chiang&#x27;s supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, which created the impression among Li&#x27;s supporters that he was a stooge of Chiang, and those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Guangxi and Canton. That let Communist forces occupy Canton in October 1949.

After Canton fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to Chongqing, and Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York for treatment of his chronic duodenum illness at the Hospital of Columbia University. Li visited President Truman, and denounced Chiang as a dictator and an usurper. Li vowed that he would &quot;return to crush&quot; Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile and did not return to Taiwan.

In the early morning of 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city in mainland China, where Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense at the Chengtu Central Military Academy. Flying out of Chengdu Fenghuangshan Airport, father and son were evacuated to Taiwan via Guangdong on the aircraft &quot;May-ling&quot; and arrived the same day. Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.

Historian Odd Arne Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang had. Also, his search for a powerful centralized government made Chiang antagonize too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened by the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese nationalism.

Chiang did not reassume the presidency until 1 March 1950. In January 1952, Chiang commanded the Control Yuan, now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the &quot;Case of Li Zongren&#x27;s Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct&quot; (李宗仁違法失職案). Chiang relieved Li of the position as vice-president of the National Assembly in March 1954.

===In Taiwan===

==== Preparations to retake the mainland ====
Chiang moved the government to Taipei, Taiwan, where he resumed his duties as president on 1 March 1950. Chiang was re-elected by the National Assembly to be the President of the Republic of China on 20 May 1954, and again in 1960, 1966, and 1972. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the territories held by his government and the People&#x27;s Republic, as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments, such as Tuva and Outer Mongolia. In the context of the Cold War, most of the Western world recognized that position, and the ROC represented China in the United Nations and other international organizations until the 1970s.
During his presidency on Taiwan, Chiang continued making preparations to take back mainland China. He developed the JROTC army to prepare for an invasion of the mainland and to defend Taiwan in case of an attack by the Communist forces. He also financed armed groups in mainland China, such as Muslim soldiers of the ROC Army who had been left in Yunnan under Li Mi and continued to fight. It was not until the 1980s that those troops were finally airlifted to Taiwan. He promoted the Uyghur Yulbars Khan to governor during the Islamic insurgency on the mainland for resisting the Communists even though the government had already evacuated to Taiwan. He planned an invasion of the mainland in 1962. In the 1950s, Chiang&#x27;s airplanes dropped supplies to Kuomintang Muslim insurgents in Qinghai, in the traditional Tibetan area of Amdo.

==== Regime in Taiwan ====

Despite an ostensibly democratic constitution, the government under Chiang was a de facto one-party state, consisting almost completely of mainlanders; the &quot;Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion&quot; greatly enhanced the executive&#x27;s powers, and the goal of retaking mainland China allowed the KMT to maintain a monopoly on power and to prohibit real parliamentary opposition. The government&#x27;s official line for the martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary since the Communists and the Nationalists were still in a state of war. Seeking to promote Chinese nationalism, Chiang&#x27;s government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression and even forbade the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions. As a result of Taiwan&#x27;s anti-government uprising in 1947, known as the February 28 incident, the KMT-led political repression resulted in the death or the disappearance of up to 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.

The first decades after the Nationalists had moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism, which was known as the &quot;White Terror&quot;; about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as &quot;bandit spies&quot; (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such or &quot;Taiwanese Separatists&quot; (台獨分子).

Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution. He was re-elected by the National Assembly as president four times: in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.
Believing that corruption and the lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT had lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT who were accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland Chinese government, such as Chiang&#x27;s brothers-in-law H. H. Kung and T. V. Soong, exiled themselves to the United States. Although politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang&#x27;s new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan&#x27;s economic success to become one of the Four Asian Tigers. After retreating to Taiwan, Chiang learned from his mistakes and failures in the mainland and blamed them for failing to pursue Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s ideals of Tridemism and welfarism. Chiang&#x27;s land reform more than doubled the land ownership of Taiwanese farmers. It removed the rent burdens on them, with former landowners using the government compensation to become the new capitalist class. He promoted a mixed economy of state and private ownership with economic planning. Chiang also promoted a nine-year free education and the importance of science in Taiwanese education and values. Those measures generated great success, with consistent and strong growth and the stabilization of inflation.

After the government of the Republic of China had moved to Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s economic policy turned towards to economic liberalism and used Sho-Chieh Tsiang and other liberal economists to promote economic liberalization reforms in Taiwan.

However, Taylor has noted that the developmental model of Chiangism in Taiwan still had elements of socialism, and the Gini index of Taiwan was around 0.28 by the 1970s, which was lower than the relatively-egalitarian West Germany. ROC (Taiwan) was one of the most equal countries in the pro-western bloc. Those in the lower 40% of income doubled their share to 22% of the total income, with the upper 20% shrinking their share from 61% to 39%, from the time of Japanese rule. The Chiangist economic model can be seen as a form of dirigisme, with the state playing a crucial role in directing the market economy. Small businesses and state-owned enterprises in Taiwan flourished under the economic model, but the economy did not see the emergence of corporate monopolies, unlike in most other major capitalist countries.

After the democratization of Taiwan, it began to slowly drift away from the Chiangist economic policy to embrace a more free market system, as part of the economic globalization process under the context of neoliberalism.

Chiang had the personal power to review the rulings of all military tribunals, which during the martial law period tried civilians as well. In 1950, Lin Pang-chun and two other men were arrested on charges of financial crimes and sentenced to 3–10 years in prison. Chiang reviewed the sentences of all three and ordered them executed instead. In 1954, the Changhua monk Kao Chih-te and two others were sentenced to 12 years in prison for providing aid to accused communists. Chiang sentenced them to death after he had reviewed the case. That control over the decision of military tribunals violated the ROC constitution.

After Chiang&#x27;s death, the next president, his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s successor, Lee Teng-hui, a native Taiwanese, would in the 1980s and 1990s increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan, paving way for the democratization process.

====Relations with Japan====
In 1971, the former Australian opposition leader Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister in 1972, and swiftly relocated the Australian mission from Taipei to Beijing, visited Japan. After meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato Whitlam observed that the reason that Japan was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was &quot;the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek.&quot; Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was largely because of the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang. This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese prisoners-of-war by the Nationalist government in the years immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members who were in power.

Although Japan recognized the People&#x27;s Republic in 1972, shortly after Kakuei Tanaka had succeeded Sato as Prime Minister of Japan, the memory of the relationship was strong enough to be reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; (15 April 1978) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between Japan and the mainland. There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger over Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda attending Chiang&#x27;s funeral. Historically, Japan&#x27;s attempts to normalize its relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic were met with accusations of ingratitude in Taiwan.

====Relations with United States====

Chiang was suspicious that covert operatives of the United States were plotting a coup against him.

In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the secret police (Bureau of Investigation and Statistics), which he remained until 1965. Chiang Kai-shek was also suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, Wu Kuo-chen lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to Chiang Ching-kuo. After fleeing to United States the same year, Wu became a vocal critic of Chiang&#x27;s family and government.

Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been educated in the Soviet Union, initiated Soviet-style military organization in the Republic of China Armed Forces. He reorganized and Sovietized the political officer corps and propagated Kuomintang ideology throughout the military. Sun Li-jen, who had been educated at the American Virginia Military Institute, opposed those practices.

Chiang Ching-kuo orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General Sun Li-jen in August 1955 for plotting a coup d&#x27;état with the CIA against his father, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.

==Death==

In 1975, 26 years after Chiang had come to Taiwan, he died in Taipei at the age of 87. He had suffered a heart attack and pneumonia in the foregoing months, and died from kidney failure aggravated by advanced heart failure on 5 April. Chiang&#x27;s funeral was held on 16 April.

A month of mourning was declared. The Chinese music composer Hwang Yau-tai wrote the &quot;Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song&quot;. In mainland China, however, Chiang&#x27;s death was met with little apparent mourning, and Communist state-run newspapers gave the brief headline &quot;Chiang Kai-shek Has Died&quot;. Chiang&#x27;s body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in Cihu, Daxi, Taoyuan. His funeral was attended by dignitaries from many nations, including US Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, South Korean Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, and two former Japanese prime ministers: Nobusuke Kishi and Eisaku Sato. was established on 5 April. The memorial day was disestablished in 2007.

The response by Japanese media was swift and shaped by a cult of personality around Chiang Kai-shek. Japanese conservatives had long promoted to counter the China policy and the historical narratives of their leftist pro-PRC opponents. The nationalist leader of Taiwan had been trained in Japanese military schools and shared a particular fondness for the Japanese Empire.

When his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby Touliao. The hope was to have both of them buried at their birthplace in Fenghua when that would be possible. In 2004, Chiang Fang-liang, the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked for both father and son to be buried at Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery in Xizhi, Taipei County (now New Taipei City). Chiang&#x27;s ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and those of his family.

Chiang was succeeded as president by Vice President Yen Chia-kan and as Kuomintang party ruler by his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who retired Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of chairman. Yen&#x27;s presidency was interim; Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the Premier, became president after the end of Yen&#x27;s term three years later.

== Cult of personality ==

Chiang&#x27;s portrait hung over Tiananmen Square until 1949, when it was replaced with Mao&#x27;s portrait. Portraits of Chiang were common in private homes and in public on the streets. After his death, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song was written in 1988 to commemorate Chiang Kai-shek. In Cihu, there are several statues of Chiang Kai-shek.
Chiang was popular among many people and dressed in plain, simple clothes, unlike contemporary Chinese warlords who dressed extravagantly.

Quotes from the Quran and hadith were used by Muslims in the Kuomintang-controlled Muslim publication, the &quot;Yuehua&quot;, to justify Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s rule over China. When the Muslim general and warlord Ma Lin was interviewed, he was described as having &quot;high admiration for and unwavering loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
The Kuomintang used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies, and promulgated martyrdom. Kuomintang ideology subserved and promulgated the view that the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang, the revolution, and the party founder Sun Yat-sen were sent to heaven. Chiang Kai-shek believed that these martyrs witnessed events on Earth from heaven after their deaths.

Unlike Sun&#x27;s original Tridemist ideology that was heavily influenced by Western enlightenment theorists such as Henry George, Abraham Lincoln, Bertrand Russell, and John Stuart Mill, the traditional Chinese Confucian influence on Chiang&#x27;s ideology is much stronger. Chiang rejected the Western progressive ideologies of individualism, liberalism, and the cultural aspects of Marxism. Therefore, Chiang is generally more culturally and socially conservative than Sun Yat-sen. Jay Taylor has described Chiang Kai-shek as a revolutionary nationalist and a &quot;left-leaning Confucian-Jacobinist&quot;.

When the Northern Expedition was complete, Kuomintang Generals led by Chiang Kai-shek paid tribute to Sun&#x27;s soul in heaven with a sacrificial ceremony at the Xiangshan Temple in Beijing in July 1928. Among the Kuomintang Generals present were the Muslim Generals Bai Chongxi and Ma Fuxiang.

Chiang Kai-shek considered both Han Chinese and all ethnic minorities of China, the Five Races Under One Union, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the mythical founder of the Chinese nation, and belonging to the Chinese Nation Zhonghua Minzu. He introduced this into Kuomintang ideology which was propagated into the educational system of the Republic of China.

Chiang, as a Chinese nationalist and a Confucian, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign and believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature, which the May Fourth Movement promoted, was not beneficial to China. He and Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China&#x27;s youth.

Chiang Kai-shek once said:
== Contemporary perception ==
Chiang&#x27;s legacy has been subjected to heated debates. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious Northern Expedition against the Beiyang warlords in 1927 and helped achieve Chinese unification. His initial image as the leader of China against Japan&#x27;s invasion, both before and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, led him to be featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine ten times. Even though China received little American aid compared to Britain and the Soviet Union, it did not fold, as Chiang called on his countrymen to fight to the &quot;bitter end&quot; until their ultimate victory against Japan in 1945.

Some also see him as a champion of anti-communism, being a key figure during the formative years of the World Anti-Communist League. During the subsequent Cold War, he was seen as the leader who led Free China and the bulwark against a possible communist invasion. However, historian Rudolph Rummel documented that the Nationalist government under Chiang led to millions of excess deaths from calamities such as its persecution against actual or perceived communists and its conscription of soldiers, confiscation of food, and flooding of downstream regions of the Yellow River during the Second Sino-Japanese War. His government was also accused of being corrupt and allying with known criminals such as Du Yuesheng for political and financial gains, and his critics often accuse him of fascism. In Taiwan, he ruled throughout a period of martial law. Some opponents charge that Chiang&#x27;s efforts in developing the island were mostly to turn it into a strong base from which to recover mainland China and that he had little regard for the Taiwanese people.

Unlike Chiang&#x27;s son Chiang Ching-kuo, who is respected across the political spectrum, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s image is perceived rather negatively in Taiwan. He was rated the lowest in two opinion polls about the perception of former presidents. His popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying better support in the Kuomintang (KMT) while being widely unpopular among Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) voters and those who blame him for the thousands killed during the February 28 Incident and criticise his dictatorial rule.

In contrast, his image has partially improved in mainland China. He had been portrayed as a villain and a &quot;bourgeoisie reactionary lackey&quot; who fought against the &quot;liberation&quot; of China by the communists, but since the 2000s, the media and popular culture have depicted him in a less negative manner. For example, many praised the 2009 movie sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party, &quot;The Founding of a Republic&quot;, for moving away from casting Chiang as &#x27;evil&#x27; versus Mao and emphasizing instead that the contingencies of war led the communists to victory. In the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, aspects of Chiang&#x27;s trip to India, or meeting with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo can be viewed positively. The shift also takes into account Chiang&#x27;s commitment to a unified China and his stance against Taiwanese separatism. Chiang&#x27;s ancestral home in Fenghua, Zhejiang, has become a museum and tourist attraction. Historian Rana Mitter notes that the displays inside were very positive about Chiang&#x27;s role during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Mitter further observed that, ironically, today&#x27;s China is closer to Chiang&#x27;s vision than to Mao&#x27;s and wrote, &quot;One can imagine Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao&#x27;s ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision&quot;. Liang Shuming opined that Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s &quot;greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful. If he had been a bit more trustworthy, if his character was somewhat better, the CCP would have been unable to beat him&quot;. Some Chinese historians argue that the main determinants for Chiang&#x27;s defeat were not corruption or the lack of US support, but his decision to start the civil war with 70% of government expenditures in the military, his overestimation of the Nationalist forces equipped with US arms, and the loss of popularity and morales of his soldiers. Other historians argue that his failure was largely caused by external factors outside of Chiang&#x27;s control. They include the refusal of the Truman administration to support Chiang by withdrawing aid, the foisting of an arms embargo by George C. Marshall, the failed pursuit of a détente between the nationalists and the communists, the American push for a coalition government with the CCP, and the USSR&#x27;s consistent aid and support for the CCP during the civil war.

In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the communists. His persistent demands for United States support and funding also prompted jokes from American officials that Chiang&#x27;s name was actually General &quot;Cash-My-Check&quot;. He has also been criticized for his poor military skills, such as issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops. In recent years, Chiang&#x27;s image has been somewhat rehabilitated, and he has been increasingly perceived as a man overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight the communists, Japanese, and provincial warlords simultaneously while trying to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful and modern nation have been noted by scholars such as Jonathan Fenby, Rana Mitter, and biographer Jay Taylor.

==Family==
=== Wives ===
In 1901, in an arranged marriage at age 14, Chiang was married to Mao Fumei, an illiterate villager five years his senior. While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two concubines (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he took Yao Yecheng (, 1887–1966) as concubine in late 1912 and married Chen Jieru (1906–1971) in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, Wei-kuo. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang, who later adopted her mother&#x27;s surname. Chen&#x27;s autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine. Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Yao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, Ching-kuo.

According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang&#x27;s second wife, she contracted gonorrhea from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Chen Jieru believed that they had become sterile; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong Mei-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.

=== Family tree ===

The Xikou Chiangs were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh, who during the 1600s moved there from Fenghua district, and whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China&#x27;s Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century CE. The 12th century BCE Duke of Zhou&#x27;s (Duke of Chou) third son was the ancestors of the Chiangs.

His great-grandfather was Chiang Qi-zeng, his grandfather was Chiang Si-qian, his uncle was Chiang Zhao-hai, and his father was Chiang Zhao-cong.

== Religion and relationships with religious communities ==

Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions, power figures, and factions in China during his regime.

=== Religious views ===
Chiang Kai-shek was born and raised as a Buddhist, but became a Methodist upon his marriage to his fourth wife, Soong Mei-ling. It was previously believed that this was a political move, but further studies of his personal diaries suggest that his faith was sincere.

=== Relationship with Muslims ===
Chiang developed relationships with other generals. Chiang became a sworn brother of the Chinese Muslim general Ma Fuxiang and appointed him to high ranking positions. Chiang addressed Ma Fuxiang&#x27;s son Ma Hongkui as Shao Yun Shixiong Ma Fuxiang attended national leadership conferences with Chiang during battles against Japan. Ma Hongkui was eventually scapegoated for the failure of the Ningxia Campaign against the Communists, so he moved to the US instead of remaining in Taiwan with Chiang.

When Chiang became President of China after the Northern Expedition, he carved out Ningxia and Qinghai out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim generals as military governors of all three provinces: Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin, and Ma Qi. The three Muslim governors, known as Xibei San Ma (lit. &quot;the three Mas of the Northwest&quot;), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their subordinates to wage war against the Soviet peoples, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as governors of the three provinces, including Ma Lin and Ma Fushou. Chiang&#x27;s appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China. The armies raised by this &quot;Ma Clique&quot;, most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed Hui general Bai Chongxi as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.

Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at Whampoa Military Academy during the Kumul Rebellion, in a jihad against Jin Shuren, Sheng Shicai, and the Soviet Union during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. Chiang designated Ma&#x27;s Muslim army as the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) and gave his troops KMT flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against Sheng and the Soviet Union in the Xinjiang War (1937). All Muslim generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army swore allegiance to him. Several, like Ma Shaowu and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.

The Ili Rebellion and Pei-ta-shan Incident plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang&#x27;s rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed Hui troops against Uyghur mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.

During Chiang&#x27;s rule, attacks on foreigners and ethnic minorities by the allied warlords of the Nationalist government such as the Ma Clique flared up in several incidents. One of these was the Battle of Kashgar where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several Britons at the British consulate in Kashgar.

Hu Songshan, a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang&#x27;s rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like Al-Azhar University and Muslim schools throughout China that taught loyalty to his regime.

The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the Quran and hadith to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.

The Yihewani (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang&#x27;s regime. Other Muslim sects, like the Xidaotang and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. Salafists attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni Gedimu denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect. Ma Ching-chiang, a Muslim General, served as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek. Ma Buqing was another Muslim General who fled to Taiwan along with Chiang. His government donated money to build the Taipei Grand Mosque on Taiwan.

=== Relationship with Buddhists and Christians ===
Chiang had uneasy relations with the Tibetans. He fought against them in the Sino-Tibetan War, and he supported the Muslim General Ma Bufang in his war against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade Tibet several times, to deter Tibetan independence, and threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

Chiang incorporated Methodist values into the New Life Movement under the influence of his wife. Dancing and Western music were discouraged. In one incident, several youths splashed acid on people wearing Western clothing, although Chiang was not directly responsible for these incidents. Despite being a Methodist, he made reference to the Buddha in his diary, and encouraged the establishment of a Buddhist political party under Master Taixu.

According to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; magazine &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, some of their members travelled to Chongqing and spoke to him personally while distributing their literature there during World War II.

<text>The compression ratio is the ratio between the maximum and minimum volume during the compression stage of the power cycle in a piston or Wankel engine. 

A fundamental specification for such engines, it can be measured in two different ways. The simpler way is the static compression ratio:
in a reciprocating engine, this is the ratio of the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke to that volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke. The dynamic compression ratio is a more advanced calculation which also takes into account gases entering and exiting the cylinder during the compression phase.

==Effect and typical ratios==
A high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of air–fuel mixture due to its higher thermal efficiency. This occurs because internal combustion engines are heat engines, and higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel, while giving a longer expansion cycle, creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature.

===Petrol engines===
In petrol (gasoline) engines used in passenger cars for the past 20 years, compression ratios have typically been between 8:1 and 12:1. Several production engines have used higher compression ratios, including:
* Cars built from 1955 to 1972 which were designed for high-octane leaded gasoline, which allowed compression ratios up to 13:1.
* Some Mazda SkyActiv engines released since 2012 have compression ratios up to 16:1. The SkyActiv engine achieves this compression ratio with ordinary unleaded gasoline (95 RON in the United Kingdom) through improved scavenging of exhaust gases (which ensures cylinder temperature is as low as possible before the intake stroke), in addition to direct injection.
* Toyota Dynamic Force engine has a compression ratio up to 14:1.
* The 2014 Ferrari 458 Speciale also has a compression ratio of 14:1.

When forced induction (e.g. a turbocharger or supercharger) is used, the compression ratio is often lower than naturally aspirated engines. This is due to the turbocharger or supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders. Engines using port fuel-injection typically run lower boost pressures and/or compression ratios than direct injected engines because port fuel injection causes the air–fuel mixture to be heated together, leading to detonation. Conversely, directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present.

Higher compression ratios can make gasoline (petrol) engines subject to engine knocking (also known as &quot;detonation&quot;, &quot;pre-ignition&quot;, or &quot;pinging&quot;) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to modify the ignition timing.

===Diesel engines===
Diesel engines use higher compression ratios than petrol engines, because the lack of a spark plug means that the compression ratio must increase the temperature of the air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel using compression ignition. Compression ratios are often between 14:1 and 23:1 for direct injection diesel engines, and between 18:1 and 23:1 for indirect injection diesel engines.

At the lower end of 14:1, NOx emissions are reduced at a cost of more difficult cold-start. Mazda&#x27;s Skyactiv-D, the first such commercial engine from 2013, used adaptive fuel injectors among other techniques to ease cold start.

===Other fuels===
The compression ratio may be higher in engines running exclusively on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or &quot;propane autogas&quot;) or compressed natural gas, due to the higher octane rating of these fuels.

Kerosene engines typically use a compression ratio of 6.5 or lower. The petrol-paraffin engine version of the Ferguson TE20 tractor had a compression ratio of 4.5:1 for operation on tractor vaporising oil with an octane rating between 55 and 70.

===Motorsport engines===
Motorsport engines often run on high-octane petrol and can therefore use higher compression ratios. For example, motorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as 14.7:1, and it is common to find motorcycles with compression ratios above 12.0:1 designed for 95 or higher octane fuel.

Ethanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline. Racing engines burning methanol and ethanol fuel often have a compression ratio of 14:1 to 16:1.

==Mathematical formula==
In a reciprocating engine, the static compression ratio (formula_1) is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the top of its stroke. It is therefore calculated by the formula
formula_2

where
*formula_3 is the displacement volume. This is the volume inside the cylinder displaced by the piston from the beginning of the compression stroke to the end of the stroke.
*formula_4 is the clearance volume. This is the volume of the space in the cylinder left at the end of the compression stroke.

formula_3 can be estimated by the cylinder volume formula:
formula_6

where
*formula_7 is the cylinder bore (diameter)
*formula_8 is the piston stroke length

Because of the complex shape of formula_4 it is usually measured directly. This is often done by filling the cylinder with liquid and then measuring the volume of the used liquid.

==Variable compression ratio engines==

Most engines use a fixed compression ratio, however a variable compression ratio engine is able to adjust the compression ratio while the engine is in operation. The first production engine with a variable compression ratio was introduced in 2019.

Variable compression ratio is a technology to adjust the compression ratio of an internal combustion engine while the engine is in operation. This is done to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads. Variable compression engines allow the volume above the piston at top dead centre to be changed.

Higher loads require lower ratios to increase power, while lower loads need higher ratios to increase efficiency, i.e. to lower fuel consumption. For automotive use this needs to be done as the engine is running in response to the load and driving demands.

The 2019 Infiniti QX50 is the first commercially available car that uses a variable compression ratio engine.

==Dynamic compression ratio==

The &quot;static compression ratio&quot; discussed above — calculated solely based on the cylinder and combustion chamber volumes — does not take into account any gases entering or exiting the cylinder during the compression phase. In most automotive engines, the intake valve closure (which seals the cylinder) takes place during the compression phase (i.e. after bottom dead centre, BDC), which can cause some of the gases to be pushed back out through the intake valve. On the other hand, intake port tuning and scavenging can cause a greater amount of gas to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest. The &quot;dynamic compression ratio&quot; accounts for these factors.

The dynamic compression ratio is higher with more conservative intake camshaft timing (i.e. soon after BDC), and lower with more radical intake camshaft timing (i.e. later after BDC). Regardless, the dynamic compression ratio is always lower than the static compression ratio.

Absolute cylinder pressure is used to calculate the dynamic compression ratio, using the following formula:
formula_10
where formula_11 is a polytropic value for the ratio of specific heats for the combustion gases at the temperatures present (this compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder)

Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the ratio of specific heats would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the dynamic compression ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be 7.51.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 bar (relative to atmospheric pressure).

The two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, but not in equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a dynamic compression ratio similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure.

<text>The Concordat of Worms (; ), also referred to as the Pactum Callixtinum or Pactum Calixtinum, was an agreement between the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire which regulated the procedure for the appointment of bishops and abbots in the Empire. Signed on 23 September 1122 in the German city of Worms by Pope Callixtus II and Emperor Henry V, the agreement set an end to the Investiture Controversy, a conflict between state and church over the right to appoint religious office holders that had begun in the middle of the 11th century.

By signing the concordat, Henry renounced his right to invest bishops and abbots with ring and crosier, and opened ecclesiastical appointments in his realm to canonical elections. Callixtus, in turn, agreed to the presence of the emperor or his officials at the elections and granted the emperor the right to intervene in the case of disputed outcomes. The emperor was also allowed to perform a separate ceremony in which he would invest bishops and abbots with a sceptre, representing the lands that constituted the temporalities associated with their episcopal see.

== Background ==
During the middle of the 11th century, a reformist movement within the Christian Church sought to reassert the rights of the Holy See at the expense of the European monarchs. Having been elected in 1073, the reformist Pope Gregory VII proclaimed several edicts aimed at strengthening the authority of the papacy, some of which were formulated in the &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; of 1075. Gregory&#x27;s edicts postulated that secular rulers were answerable to the pope and forbade them to make appointments to clerical offices (a process known as investiture).

The pope&#x27;s doctrines were vehemently rejected by Henry IV, the Holy Roman Emperor, who habitually invested the bishops and abbots of his realm. The ensuing conflict between the Empire and the papacy is known as the Investiture Controversy. The dispute continued after the death of Gregory VII in 1084 and the abdication of Henry IV in 1105.

Even though Henry&#x27;s son and successor, the Emperor Henry V, looked towards reconciliation with the reformist movement, no lasting compromise was achieved in the first 16 years of his reign. In 1111, Henry V brokered an agreement with Pope Paschal II at Sutri, whereby he would abstain from investing clergy in his realm in exchange for the restoration of church property that had originally belonged to the Empire. The Sutri agreement, Henry hoped, would convince Paschal to assent to Henry&#x27;s official coronation as emperor.

The agreement failed to be implemented, leading Henry to imprison the pope. After two months of captivity, Paschal vowed to grant the coronation and to accept the emperor&#x27;s role in investiture ceremonies. He also agreed never to excommunicate Henry. Given that these concessions had been won by force, ecclesiastical opposition to the Empire continued. The following year, Paschal reneged on his promises.

== Mouzon summit ==
In January 1118, Pope Paschal died. He was succeeded by Gelasius II, who died in January 1119. His successor, the Burgundian Callixtus II, resumed negotiations with the Emperor with the aim of settling the dispute between the church and the Empire. In the autumn of 1119, two papal emissaries, William of Champeaux and Pons of Cluny, met Henry at Strasbourg, where the emperor agreed in principle to abandon the secular investiture ceremony that involved giving new bishops and abbots a ring and a crosier.

The two parties scheduled a final summit between Henry and Callixtus at Mouzon, but the meeting ended abruptly after the emperor refused to accept a short-notice change in Callixtus&#x27;s demands. The church leaders, who were deliberating their position at a council in Reims, reacted by excommunicating Henry. However, they did not endorse the pope&#x27;s insistence upon the complete abandonment of secular investiture. The negotiations ended in failure.

Historians disagree as to whether Calixtus actually wanted peace or fundamentally mistrusted Henry. Due to his uncompromising position in 1111, Calixtus has been termed an &quot;ultra&quot;, and his election to the papacy may indicate that the College of Cardinals saw no reason to show weakness to the emperor. This optimism about victory was founded on the very visible, and very vocal opposition to Henry from within his own nobility, and the cardinals may have seen the emperor&#x27;s internal weaknesses as an opportunity for outright victory.

== Further negotiations ==
After the failure of the Mouzon negotiations, and the disappearance into the horizon of the chances of Henry&#x27;s unconditional surrender, the majority of the clergy became willing to compromise in order to settle the dispute. The polemic writings and pronouncements that had figured so highly during the Investiture Dispute had died down by this point. Historian Gerd Tellenbach argues that, despite appearances, these years were &quot;no longer marked by an atmosphere of bitter conflict&quot;.

This was in part the result of the papacy&#x27;s realization that it could not win two different disputes on two separate fronts, as it had been trying to do. Calixtus had been personally involved in negotiations with the Emperor over the last decade, and his intimate knowledge of the delicate situation made him the perfect candidate for the attempt. The difference between 1119 and 1122, argues Stroll, was not Henry, who had been willing to make concessions in 1119, but Calixtus, who had then been intransigent, but who now was intent upon reaching an agreement&quot;.
The same sentiment prevailed in much of the German nobility. In 1121, pressured by a faction of nobles from the Lower Rhine and Duchy of Saxony under the leadership of the archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, Henry agreed to submit to make peace with the pope. In response in February 1122, Calixtus wrote to Henry in a conciliatory tone via the Bishop of Acqui. His letter has been described as &quot;a carefully crafted overture&quot;.

In his letter, Calixtus drew attention to their blood relationship, suggesting that while their shared ancestry compelled them to love each other as brothers, it was fundamental that the German kings draw their authority from God, but via his servants, not directly. However, Calixtus also emphasised for the first time that he blamed not Henry personally for the dispute but his bad advisors who had dictated unsound policy to him. In a major shift in policy since the Council of Reims of 1119, the pope stated that the church gifts what it possesses to all its children, without making claims upon them. This was intended to reassure Henry that in the event of peace between them, his position and Empire were secure.

Shifting from the practical to the spiritual, Calixtus next asked Henry to bear in mind that he was a king, but like all men limited on his earthly capability; he had armies, and kings below him, but the church had Christ and the Apostles. Continuing his theme, he referred, indirectly, to Henry&#x27;s excommunication by himself (twice), he begged Henry to allow the conditions for peace to be created, as a result of which the church&#x27;s, and God&#x27;s glory would be increased, as concomitantly would the Emperor&#x27;s. Conversely, he made sure to include a threat: if Henry did not change his ways, Calixtus threatened to place &quot;the protection of the church in the hands of wise men&quot;.

Historian Mary Stroll argues that, in taking this approach, Calixtus was taking advantage of the fact that, while he himself &quot;was hardly in a position to sabre rattle&quot; due to his military defeat in the south and his difficulty with his own Cardinals, Henry was also under pressure in Germany in both the military and spiritual spheres.

The Emperor replied through the Bishop of Speyer and the Abbot of Fulda, who travelled to Rome and collected the pope&#x27;s emissaries under the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia. Speyer was a representative of Henry&#x27;s political opponents in Germany, whereas Fulda was a negotiator rather than politically partisan. Complicating matters was a disputed election to the bishopric of Wurzburg in February 1122 of the kind that was at the heart of the Investiture Dispute. Although this almost led to an outbreak of civil war, a truce was arranged in August, allowing the parties to return to the papal negotiations.

In the summer of 1122, a synod was convened in Mainz, at which imperial emissaries concluded the terms of their agreement with representatives of the church. In a sign that the Pope intended the impending negotiations to be successful, a Lateran council was announced for the following year.

== Worms ==
The Emperor received the papal legates in Worms with due ceremony, where he awaited the outcome of the negotiations which appear to have actually taken place in nearby Mainz, which was hostile territory to Henry. As such, he had to communicate via messenger to keep up with events. Abbot Ekkehard of Aura chronicles that discussions took over a week to conclude. On 8 September, he met the papal legates and their final agreements were codified for publication.

Although a possible compromise solution had already been received from England, this does not seem to have ever been considered in depth, probably on account of it containing an oath of Homage between Emperor and Pope, which had been a historical sticking point in earlier negotiations. The papal delegation was led by Cardinal bishop Lamberto Scannabecchi of Ostia, the future Pope Honorius II.

Both sides studied previous negotiations between them, including those from 1111, which were considered to have created precedent. On 23 September 1122, papal and imperial delegates signed a series of documents outside the walls of Worms. There was insufficient room in the city for the number of attendees and watchers. Adalbert, Archbishop of Mainz wrote to Calixtus of how complex the negotiations had been, given that, as he said, Henry regarded the powers he was being asked to renounce as being hereditary in the Imperial throne. It is probable that what was eventually promulgated was the result of almost every word being carefully considered. The main difference between what was to be agreed at Worms and previous negotiations were the concessions from the pope.

== Concordat ==
The agreements come to at Worms were in the nature of both concessions and assurances to the other party. Henry, on oath before God, the apostles and the church renounced his right to invest bishops and abbots with ring and crosier, and opened ecclesiastical appointments in his realm to canonical elections, &quot;regno vel imperio&quot;. He also recognised the traditional extent and boundaries of the papal patrimony as a legal entity rather than one malleable to the emperor. Henry promised to return to the church those lands rightfully belonging to the church seized by himself or his father to the church; furthermore, he would assist the pope in regaining those that were taken by others, and &quot;he will do the same thing for all other churches and princes, both ecclesiastical and lay&quot;. If the pope requested Imperial assistance, he would receive it, and if the church came to the empire for justice, it would be treated fairly. He also swore to abstain from &quot;all investiture by ring and staff&quot;, marking the end of an ancient imperial tradition.

Callixtus made similar reciprocal promises regarding the empire in Italy. He agreed to the presence of the emperor or his officials at the elections and granted the emperor the right to ajudge in the case of disputed outcomes on episcopal advice—as long as they had been held peacefully and without simony—which had officially been the case ever since precedent had been set by the London Accord of 1107. This right to judge was constrained by an assurance that he would support the majority vote among electors, and further that he would take the advice of his other bishops before doing so. The emperor was also allowed to perform a separate ceremony in which he would invest bishops and abbots with their &quot;regalia&quot;, a sceptre representing the imperial lands associated with their episcopal see. This clause also contained a &quot;cryptic&quot; condition that once the elect had been so endowed, the new bishop &quot;should do what he ought to do according to imperial rights&quot;. In the German imperial lands this was to take place prior to the bishop-elect&#x27;s consecration; elsewhere in the empire—Burgundy and Italy, exempting the Papal States—within six months of the ceremony. The differentiating between the German portion of the Empire and the rest was of particular importance to Calixtus as the papacy had traditionally felt threatened more from it in the peninsular than the broader Empire. Finally, the pope granted &quot;true peace&quot; on the emperor and all those who had supported him. Calixtus had effectively overturned wholesale the strategy he had pursued during the Mouzon negotiation; episcopal investitures in Germany were to take place with very little substantive change in ceremony, while temporal involvement remained, only replacing investiture with homage, although the word itself—&quot;hominium&quot;—was studiously avoided. Adalbert, from whom Calixtus first received news of the final concordat, emphasized that it still had to be approved in Rome; this suggests, argues Stroll, that the Archbishop—and probably the papal legation as a whole—were against making concessions to the emperor, and probably wanted Calixtus to disown the agreement. Adalbert believed the agreement would make it easier for the Emperor to legalise intimidation of episcopal electors, writing that &quot;through the opportunity of [the emperor&#x27;s] presence, the Church of God must undergo the same slavery as before, or an even more oppressive one&quot;.

However, argues Stroll, the concessions Calixtus made were an &quot;excellent bargain&quot; in return for eradicating the danger on the papacy&#x27;s northern border and therefore allowing him to focus, without threat or distraction, on the Normans to the south. It had achieved its peace, argues Norman Cantor, by allowing local national custom and practice to determine future relations between crown and pope; in most cases, he notes, this &quot;favored the continuance of royal control over the church&quot;.

The concordat was published as two distinct charters, each laying out the concessions the one party was making to the other. They are known respectively as the Papal (or the &quot;Calixtinum&quot;) and the Imperial (&quot;Henricianum&quot;) charters. Calixtus&#x27;s is addressed to the emperor—in quite personal terms—while Henry&#x27;s is made out to God. The bishop of Ostia gave the emperor the kiss of peace on behalf of the pope and said Mass. By these rites was Henry returned to the church, the negotiators were lauded for succeeding in their delicate mission and the concordat was called &quot;peace at the will of the pope&quot;. Neither charter was signed; both contained probably intentional vagaries and unanswered questions—such as the position of the papacy&#x27;s churches that lay outside both the patrimony and Germany—which were subsequently addressed on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, Robert Benson has suggested that the brevity of the charters was deliberate and that the agreement as a whole is as important for what it omits as for what it includes. The term &quot;regalia&quot;, for example, was not only undefined but literally meant two different things to each party. In the &quot;Henricianum&quot; it referred to the feudal duty owed to a monarch; in the Calixtinium, it was the episcopal temporalities. Broader question, such as the nature of the church and Empire relationship, were also not addressed, although some ambiguity was removed by an 1133 Papal privilege.

The Concordat was widely, and deliberately, publicised around Europe. Calixtus was not in Rome when the concordat was delivered. He had left the city by late August and was not to return until mid- to late October, making a progress to Anagni, taking the bishopric of Anagni and Casamari Abbey under his protection.

=== Preservation ===
The concordat was ratified at the First Council of the Lateran and the original &quot;Henricianum&quot; charter is preserved at the Vatican Apostolic Archive; the &quot;Calixtinum&quot; has not survived except in subsequent copies. A copy of the former is also held in the &quot;Codex Udalrici&quot;, but this is an abridged version for political circulation, as it reduces the number of imperial concessions made. Indicating the extent that he saw the agreement as a papal victory, Calixtus had a copy of the &quot;Henricianum&quot; painted on a Lateran Palace chamber wall; while nominally portraying the concordat as a victory for the papacy, it also ignored the numerous concessions made to the emperor. This was part of what Hartmut Hoffmann has called &quot;a conspiracy of silence&quot; regarding papal concessions. Indeed, while the Pope is pictured enthroned, and Henry only standing, the suggestion is still that they were jointly wielding their respective authority to come to this agreement. An English copy of the &quot;Calixtinum&quot; made by William of Malmsbury is reasonably accurate but omits the clause mentioning the use of a sceptre in the granting of the &quot;regalia&quot;. He then, having condemned Henry&#x27;s &quot;Teuton fury&quot;, proceeds to praise him, comparing him favourably to Charlemagne for his devotion to God and the peace of Christendom.

== Aftermath ==

The first invocation of the concordat was not in the empire, as it turned out, but by Henry I of England the following year. Following a long-running dispute between Canterbury–York which ended up in the Papal court, Joseph Huffman argues that it would have been controversial for the Pope &quot;to justify one set of concessions in Germany and another in England&quot;. The concordat ended once and for all the &quot;Imperial church system of the Ottonians and Salians&quot;. The First Lateran Council was convoked to confirm the Concordat of Worms. The council was most representative with nearly 300 bishops and 600 abbots from every part of Catholic Europe being present. It convened on March 18, 1123. One of its primary concerns was to emphasise the independence of diocesan clergy, and to do so it forbade monks to leave their monasteries to provide pastoral care, which would in future be the sole preserve of the diocese. In ratifying the Concordat, the Council confirmed that in future bishops would be elected by their clergy, although, also per the Concordat, the Emperor could refuse the homage of German bishops.

Decrees were passed directed against simony, concubinage among the clergy, church robbers, and forgers of Church documents; the council also reaffirmed indulgences for Crusaders. These, argues C. Colt Anderson &quot;established important precedents in canon law restricting the influence of the laity and the monks&quot;. While this led to a busy period of reform, it was important for those advocating reform not to allow themselves to be confused with the myriad heretical sects and schismatics who were making similar criticisms.

The Concordat was the last major achievement for Emperor Henry, as he died in 1125; an attempted invasion of France came to nothing in 1124 in the face of &quot;determined opposition&quot;. Fuhrmann comments that, as Henry had shown in his life &quot;even less interest in new currents of thought and feeling than his father&quot;, he probably did not understand the significance of the events he had lived through. The peace only lasted until his death; when Imperial Electors met to choose his successor, reformists took the opportunity to attack the imperial gains of Worms on the grounds that they had been granted to him personally rather than Emperors generally. However, later emperors, such as Frederick I and Henry VI, continued to wield as much, if intangible, power as their predecessors in episcopal elections, and to a greater degree to that allowed them by Calixtus&#x27; charter. Successive emperors found the Concordat sufficiently favourable that it remained, almost unaltered until the empire was dissolved by Francis II in 1806 on account of Napoleon. Popes, likewise, were able to use the powers codified to them in the Concordatto their advantage in future internal disputes with their Cardinals.

== Reception ==

The most detailed contemporary description of the Concordat comes to historians through a brief chronicle known as the 1125 continuation chronicle. This pro-papal document lays the blame for the schism squarely upon Henry—by his recognition of Gregory VIII—and the praise for ending it on Calixtus, through his making only temporary compromises. I. S. Robinson, writing in The New Cambridge Medieval History, suggests that this was a deliberate ploy to leave further negotiations open with a more politically malleable Emperor in future. To others it was not so clear cut; Honorius of Autun, for example, writing later in the century discussed lay investiture as an aspect of papal-Imperial relations and, even a century later the &quot;Sachsenspiegel&quot; still stated that Emperors nominated bishops in Germany. Robinson suggests that, by the end of the 12th century, &quot;it was the imperial, rather than the papal version of the Concordat of Worms that was generally accepted by German churchmen&quot;.

The contemporary English historian William of Malmesbury praised the Concordat for curtailing what he perceived as the emperor&#x27;s overreach, or as he put it, &quot;severing the sprouting necks of Teuton fury with the axe of Apostolic power&quot;. However, he regarded the final settlement not as a defeat of the Empire at the hands of the church, but rather as a reconciliatory effort by the two powers. Although polemicism had died down in the years preceding the Concordat, it did not finish them completely, and factionalism within the church especially continued. Gerhoh of Reichersberg believed that the emperor now had the right to request German bishops pay homage to him, something that would never have been allowed under Paschal, due to the vague clause instructing newly-elects to the things the emperor wished. Gerhoh argued that now imperial intervention in episcopal elections had been curtailed, Henry would use this clause to extend his influence in the church by means of homage. Gerhoh was torn between viewing the concordat as the end of a long struggle between pope and empire, or whether it marked the beginning of a new one within the church itself. Likewise Adelbert of Mainz—who had casually criticised the agreement in his report to Calixtus—continued to lobby against it, and continued to bring complaints against Henry, whom, for example, he alleged had illegally removed the Bishop of Strassburg who was suspected of complicity in the death of Duke Berthold of Zaehringen.

The reformist party within the church took a similar view, criticising the Concordat for failing to remove all secular influence on the church. For this reason, a group of followers of Paschal II unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the agreement&#x27;s ratification at the Lateran Council, crying &quot;non placet!&quot; when asked to do so: &quot;it was only when it was pointed out that much had to be accepted for the sake of peace that the atmosphere quietened&quot;. Calixtus told them that they had &quot;not to approve but tolerate&quot; it. At a council in Bamberg in 1122 Henry gathered those nobles who had not attended the Concordat to seek their approval of the agreement, which they did. The following month he sent cordial letters to Calixtus agreeing with the pope&#x27;s position that as brothers in Christ they were bound by God to work together, etc., and that he would soon visit personally to discuss the repatriation of papal land. These letters were, in turn, responded to positively by Calixtus, who instructed his delegates to make good the promises they had made at Worms.

=== Historiography ===
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz called the agreements made at Worms &quot;the oldest concordat in German history, an international treaty&quot;, while Augustin Fliche argued that the Concordat effectively instituted the statutes of Ivo of Chartres, a prominent reformer in the early years of the Investiture Contest, a view, it has been suggested, that most historians agree with. The historian Uta-Renate Blumenthal writes that, despite its shortcomings, the Concordat freed &quot;[the church and the Empire] from antiquated concepts with their increasingly anachronistic restrictions&quot;. According to the historian William Chester Jordan, the Concordat was &quot;of enormous significance&quot; because it demonstrated that the emperor, in spite of his great secular power, did not have any religious authority. On the other hand, argues Karl F. Morrison, any victory the papacy felt it had won was pyrrhic, as &quot;the king was left in possession of the field&quot;. The new peace also now allowed the papacy to expand its territories in Italy, such as the Sabina, which were unobtainable while the dispute with Henry was ongoing, while in Germany, a new class of ecclesiastics was created, what Horst Fuhrmann calls the &quot;ecclesiastical princes of the Empire&quot;.

While most historians agree that the Concordat marks a clear close to the fifty-year-old struggle between church and empire, disagreement continues on just how decisive a termination that was. Historians are also unclear as to the commitment of the pope to the concordat. Stroll, for example, notes that, while Henry&#x27;s oaths were made to the church corporate, so in perpetuity, while Calixtus&#x27;s may have been in a personal capacity. This, Stroll argues, would mean that it could be argued that while Henry&#x27;s commitments to the church applied forever, Calixtus&#x27;s applied only for the duration of Henry&#x27;s reign, and at least one contemporary, Otto of Freising, wrote later in the century that he believed this to be the church&#x27;s position. Stroll considers it &quot;implausible&quot; that Henry and his counsel would ever have entered into such a one-sided agreement. Indeed, John O&#x27;Malley has argued that the emperor had effectively been granted a veto from Calixtus; while in the strictest interpretation of the Gregorian reformers the only two important things in the making of a bishop were his election and consecration, Calixtus had effectively codified a role—however small—for the emperor in this process. Conversely, Benson reckons that while Henry&#x27;s agreement was with the church in perpetuity, Calixtus&#x27;—based on the personal mode of address—was with him personally, and as such not binding on his successors. However, this was also an acknowledgement, he suggests, that much of what the pope did not address was already considered customary, and so did not need addressing.

There has also been disagreement in why the Investiture contest ended with the Concordat as it did. Benson notes that, as a truce, it was primarily intended to stop the fighting rather than to address its original causes. It was &quot;a straightforward, political engagement...a pragmatic agreement&quot; between two political bodies. Indeed, controversy over investiture continued for at least another decade; in that light, suggests Benson, it could be argued that the Concordat did not end the dispute at all. There were &quot;many problems unsolved, and [it] left much room for the free play of power&quot;. Political scientist Bruce Bueno de Mesquita has argued that, in the long term, the Concordat was an essential component to the later—gradual—creation of the European nation state.

<text>In formal language theory, a context-free language (CFL), also called a [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky]] type-2 language, is a language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in programming languages, in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

==Background==

===Context-free grammar===

Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.

===Automata===

The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata, which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.

==Examples==

An example context-free language is formula_1, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are &#x27;s, and the entire second halves of which are &#x27;s. is generated by the grammar formula_2.
This language is not regular.
It is accepted by the pushdown automaton formula_3 where formula_4 is defined as follows:

:formula_5

Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are inherently ambiguous CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of formula_6 with formula_7. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset formula_8 which is the intersection of these two languages.

===Dyck language===

The language of all properly matched parentheses is generated by the grammar formula_9.

==Properties==

===Context-free parsing===
The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.

Determining an instance of the membership problem; i.e. given a string formula_10, determine whether formula_11 where formula_12 is the language generated by a given grammar formula_13; is also known as &quot;recognition&quot;. Context-free recognition for Chomsky normal form grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to Boolean matrix multiplication, thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2.3728596).
Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3−ε) Boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3−3ε) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.

Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called &quot;parsing&quot;. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.

Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the CYK algorithm and Earley&#x27;s Algorithm.

A special subclass of context-free languages are the deterministic context-free languages which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton and can be parsed by a LR(k) parser.

See also parsing expression grammar as an alternative approach to grammar and parser.

===Closure properties===
The class of context-free languages is closed under the following operations. That is, if &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:
*the union formula_14 of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot;
*the reversal of &quot;L&quot;
*the concatenation formula_15 of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot;
*the Kleene star formula_16 of &quot;L&quot;
*the image formula_17 of &quot;L&quot; under a homomorphism formula_18
*the image formula_19 of &quot;L&quot; under an inverse homomorphism formula_20
*the circular shift of &quot;L&quot; (the language formula_21)
*the prefix closure of &quot;L&quot; (the set of all prefixes of strings from &quot;L&quot;)
*the quotient &quot;L&quot;/&quot;R&quot; of &quot;L&quot; by a regular language &quot;R&quot;

====Nonclosure under intersection, complement, and difference====
The context-free languages are not closed under intersection. This can be seen by taking the languages formula_22 and formula_23, which are both context-free. Their intersection is formula_24, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the pumping lemma for context-free languages. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, their intersection can be expressed by union and complement: formula_25. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: formula_26.

However, if &quot;L&quot; is a context-free language and &quot;D&quot; is a regular language then both their intersection formula_27 and their difference formula_28 are context-free languages.

===Decidability===
In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.

The following problems are undecidable for arbitrarily given context-free grammars A and B:
*Equivalence: is formula_29?
*Disjointness: is formula_30 ? However, the intersection of a context-free language and a &quot;regular&quot; language is context-free, hence the variant of the problem where &quot;B&quot; is a regular grammar is decidable (see &quot;Emptiness&quot; below).
*Containment: is formula_31 ? Again, the variant of the problem where &quot;B&quot; is a regular grammar is decidable, while that where &quot;A&quot; is regular is generally not.
*Universality: is formula_32?
*Regularity: is formula_33 a regular language?
*Ambiguity: is every grammar for formula_33 ambiguous?

The following problems are &quot;decidable&quot; for arbitrary context-free languages:
*Emptiness: Given a context-free grammar &quot;A&quot;, is formula_35 ?
*Finiteness: Given a context-free grammar &quot;A&quot;, is formula_33 finite?
*Membership: Given a context-free grammar &quot;G&quot;, and a word formula_10, does formula_11 ? Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the membership problem are the CYK algorithm and Earley&#x27;s Algorithm.

According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003), 
many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir

===Languages that are not context-free===

The set formula_8 is a context-sensitive language, but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language. So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the pumping lemma for context-free languages or a number of other methods, such as Ogden&#x27;s lemma or Parikh&#x27;s theorem.
