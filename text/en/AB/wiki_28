<text>Chris Marker (; 29 July 1921 – 29 July 2012) was a French writer, photographer, documentary film director, multimedia artist and film essayist. His best known films are &quot;La Jetée&quot; (1962), &quot;A Grin Without a Cat&quot; (1977) and &quot;Sans Soleil&quot; (1983). Marker is usually associated with the Left Bank subset of the French New Wave that occurred in the late 1950s and 1960s, and included such other filmmakers as Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda and Jacques Demy.

His friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais called him &quot;the prototype of the twenty-first-century man.&quot; Film theorist Roy Armes has said of him: &quot;Marker is unclassifiable because he is unique... French Cinema has its dramatists and its poets, its technicians, and its autobiographers, but only has one true essayist: Chris Marker.&quot;

==Early life==

Marker was born Christian François Bouche-Villeneuve. He was always elusive about his past and known to refuse interviews and not allow photographs to be taken of him; his place of birth is highly disputed. Some sources and Marker himself claim that he was born in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Other sources say he was born in Belleville, Paris, and others, in Neuilly-sur-Seine. The 1949 edition of &quot;Le Cœur Net&quot; gives his birthday as 22 July. Film critic David Thomson has said, &quot;Marker told me himself that Mongolia is correct. I have since concluded that Belleville is correct—but that does not spoil the spiritual truth of Ulan Bator.&quot; When asked about his secretive nature, Marker said, &quot;My films are enough for them [the audience].&quot;

Marker was a philosophy student in France before World War II. During the German occupation of France, he joined the Maquis (FTP), a part of the French Resistance. At some point during the war he left France and joined the United States Air Force as a paratrooper, although some sources claim that this is not true. After the war, he began a career as a journalist, first writing for the journal &quot;Esprit&quot;, a neo-Catholic, Marxist magazine where he met fellow journalist André Bazin. For &quot;Esprit&quot;, Marker wrote political commentaries, poems, short stories, and film reviews.

During this period, Marker began to travel around the world as a journalist and photographer, a vocation he pursued for the rest of his life. The French publishing company Éditions du Seuil hired him as editor of the series &quot;Petite Planète&quot; (&quot;Small World&quot;). That collection devoted one edition to each country and included information and photographs, and would later be published in English translation by Studio Vista and The Viking Press. In 1949 Marker published his first novel, &quot;Le Coeur net&quot; (&quot;The Forthright Spirit&quot;), which was about aviation. In 1952 Marker published an illustrated essay on French writer Jean Giraudoux, &quot;Giraudoux Par Lui-Même&quot;.

==Early career (1950–1961)==

During his early journalism career, Marker became increasingly interested in filmmaking and in the early 1950s experimented with photography. Around this time Marker met and befriended many members of the Left Bank Film Movement, including Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, Henri Colpi, Armand Gatti, and the novelists Marguerite Duras and Jean Cayrol. This group is often associated with the French New Wave directors who came to prominence during the same time period, and the groups were often friends and journalistic co-workers. The term &quot;Left Bank&quot; was first coined by film critic Richard Roud, who described them as having &quot;fondness for a kind of Bohemian life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the plastic arts, and a consequent interest in experimental filmmaking&quot;, as well as an identification with the political left. Anatole Dauman produced many of Marker&#x27;s earliest films.

In 1952 Marker made his first film, &quot;Olympia 52&quot;, a 16mm feature documentary about the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games. In 1953 he collaborated with Resnais on the documentary &quot;Statues Also Die&quot;. The film examines traditional African art such as sculptures and masks, and its decline with the coming of Western colonialism. It won the 1954 Prix Jean Vigo, but was banned by French censors for its criticism of French colonialism.

After working as assistant director on Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Night and Fog&quot; in 1955, Marker made &quot;Sunday in Peking&quot;, a short documentary &quot;film essay&quot; in the style that characterized Marker&#x27;s output for most of his career. Marker shot the film in two weeks while traveling through China with Armand Gatti in September 1955. In the film, Marker&#x27;s commentary overlaps scenes from China, such as tombs that, contrary to Westernized understandings of Chinese legends, do not contain the remains of Ming dynasty emperors.

After working on the commentary for Resnais&#x27;s film &quot;Le mystère de l&#x27;atelier quinze&quot; in 1957, Marker continued to refine his style with the feature documentary &quot;Letter from Siberia&quot;. An essay film on the narrativization of Siberia, it contains Marker&#x27;s signature commentary, which takes the form of a letter from the director, in the long tradition of epistolary treatments by French explorers of the &quot;undeveloped&quot; world. &quot;Letter &quot;looks at Siberia&#x27;s movement into the 20th century and at some of the tribal cultural practices receding into the past. It combines footage Marker shot in Siberia with old newsreel footage, cartoon sequences, stills, and even an illustration of Alfred E. Neuman from &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; as well as a fake TV commercial as part of a humorous attack on Western mass culture. In producing a meta-commentary on narrativity and film, Marker uses the same brief filmic sequence three times but with different commentary—the first praising the Soviet Union, the second denouncing it, and the third taking an apparently neutral or &quot;objective&quot; stance.

In 1959 Marker made the animated film &quot;Les Astronautes&quot; with Walerian Borowczyk. The film was a combination of traditional drawings with still photography. In 1960 he made &quot;Description d&#x27;un combat&quot;, a documentary on the State of Israel that reflects on its past and future. The film won the Golden Bear for Best Documentary at the 1961 Berlin Film Festival.

In January 1961, Marker traveled to Cuba and shot the film &quot;¡Cuba Sí!&quot; The film promotes and defends Fidel Castro and includes two interviews with him. It ends with an anti-American epilogue in which the United States is embarrassed by the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco, and was subsequently banned. The banned essay was included in Marker&#x27;s first volume of collected film commentaries, &quot;Commentaires I&quot;, published in 1961. The following year Marker published &quot;Coréennes&quot;, a collection of photographs and essays on conditions in Korea.

==&quot;La Jetée&quot; and &quot;Le Joli Mai&quot; (1962–1966)==

Marker became known internationally for the short film &quot;La Jetée&quot; (&quot;The Pier&quot;) in 1962. It tells of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel by using a series of filmed photographs developed as a photomontage of varying pace, with limited narration and sound effects. In the film, a survivor of a futuristic third World War is obsessed with distant and disconnected memories of a pier at the Orly Airport, the image of a mysterious woman, and a man&#x27;s death. Scientists experimenting in time travel choose him for their studies, and the man travels back in time to contact the mysterious woman, and discovers that the man&#x27;s death at the Orly Airport was his own. Except for one shot of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up, the film is composed entirely of photographs by Jean Chiabaud and stars Davos Hanich as the man, Hélène Châtelain as the woman and photographer-film director William Klein as a man from the future.

While making &quot;La Jetée&quot;, Marker was simultaneously making the 150-minute documentary essay-film &quot;Le joli mai&quot;, released in 1963. Beginning in the spring of 1962, Marker and his camera operator Pierre Lhomme shot 55 hours of footage interviewing random people on the streets of Paris. The questions, asked by the unseen Marker, range from their personal lives, as well as social and political issues of relevance at that time. As he had with montages of landscapes and indigenous art, Marker created a film essay that contrasted and juxtaposed a variety of lives with his signature commentary (spoken by Marker&#x27;s friends, singer-actor Yves Montand in the French version and Simone Signoret in the English version). The film has been compared to the &quot;Cinéma vérité&quot; films of Jean Rouch, and criticized by its practitioners at the time. The term &quot;Cinéma vérité&quot; was itself anathema to Marker, who never used it. Instead, he preferred his own term &quot;ciné, ma vérité,&quot; meaning &quot;cinéma, my truth.&quot; It was shown in competition at the 1963 Venice Film Festival, where it won the award for Best First Work. It also won the Golden Dove Award at the Leipzig DOK Festival.

After the documentary &quot;Le Mystère Koumiko&quot; in 1965, Marker made &quot;Si j&#x27;avais quatre dromadaires&quot;, an essay-film that, like &quot;La Jetée&quot;, is a photomontage of over 800 photographs Marker had taken over the previous 10 years in 26 countries. The commentary involves a conversation between a fictitious photographer and two friends, who discuss the photos. The film&#x27;s title is an allusion to a poem by Guillaume Apollinaire. It was the last film in which Marker included &quot;travel footage&quot; for many years.

==SLON and ISKRA (1967–1974)==

In 1967 Marker published his second volume of collected film essays, &quot;Commentaires II&quot;. That same year, Marker organized the omnibus film &quot;Loin du Vietnam&quot;, a protest against the Vietnam War with segments contributed by Marker, Jean-Luc Godard, Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, Claude Lelouch, William Klein, Michele Ray and Joris Ivens. The film includes footage of the war, from both sides, as well as anti-war protests in New York and Paris and other anti-war activities.

From this initial collection of filmmakers with left-wing political agendas, Marker created the group S.L.O.N. (&quot;Société pour le lancement des oeuvres nouvelles&quot;, &quot;Society for launching new works&quot;, but also the Russian word for &quot;elephant&quot;). SLON was a film collective whose objectives were to make films and to encourage industrial workers to create film collectives of their own. Its members included Valerie Mayoux, Jean-Claude Lerner, Alain Adair and John Tooker. Marker is usually credited as director or co-director of all of the films made by SLON.

After the events of May 1968, Marker felt a moral obligation to abandon his own personal film career and devote himself to SLON and its activities. SLON&#x27;s first film was about a strike at a Rhodiacéta factory in France, &quot;À bientôt, j&#x27;espère&quot; (&quot;Rhodiacéta&quot;) in 1968. Later that year SLON made &quot;La Sixième face du pentagone&quot;, about an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C., and was a reaction to what SLON considered to be the unfair and censored reportage of such events on mainstream television. The film was shot by François Reichenbach, who received co-director credit. &quot;La Bataille des dix millions&quot; was made in 1970 with Mayoux as co-director and Santiago Álvarez as cameraman and is about the 1970 sugar crop in Cuba and its disastrous effects on the country. In 1971, SLON made &quot;Le Train en marche&quot;, a new prologue to Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Medvedkin&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;Schastye&quot;, which had recently been re-released in France.

In 1974, SLON became I.S.K.R.A. (&quot;Images, Sons, Kinescope, Réalisations, Audiovisuelles&quot;, but also the name of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s political newspaper &quot;Iskra,&quot; which also is a Russian word for &quot;spark&quot;).

==Return to personal work (1974–1986)==

In 1974 Marker returned to his personal work and made a film outside of ISKRA. &quot;La Solitude du chanteur de fond&quot; is a one-hour documentary about Marker&#x27;s friend Yves Montand&#x27;s benefit concert for Chilean refugees. The concert was Montand&#x27;s first public performance in four years, and the documentary includes film clips from his long career as a singer and actor.

Marker had been working on a film about Chile with ISKRA since 1973. Marker had collaborated with Belgian sociologist Armand Mattelart and ISKRA members Valérie Mayoux and Jacqueline Meppiel to shoot and collect the visual materials, which Marker then edited together and provided the commentary for. The resulting film was the two and a half-hour documentary &quot;La Spirale&quot;, released in 1975. The film chronicles events in Chile, beginning with the 1970 election of socialist President Salvador Allende until his murder and the resulting coup in 1973.

Marker then began work on one of his most ambitious films, &quot;A Grin Without a Cat&quot;, released in 1977. The film&#x27;s title refers to the Cheshire Cat from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The metaphor compares the promise of the global socialist movement before May 1968 (the grin) with its actual presence in the world after May 1968 (the cat). The film&#x27;s original French title is &quot;Le fond de l&#x27;air est rouge&quot;, which means &quot;the air is essentially red&quot;, or &quot;revolution is in the air&quot;, implying that the socialist movement was everywhere around the world.

The film was intended to be an all-encompassing portrait of political movements since May 1968, a summation of the work which he had taken part in for ten years. The film is divided into two parts: the first half focuses on the hopes and idealism before May 1968, and the second half on the disillusion and disappointments since those events. Marker begins the film with the Odessa Steps sequence from Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot;, which Marker points out is a fictitious creation of Eisenstein which has still influenced the image of the historical event. Marker used very little commentary in this film, but the film&#x27;s montage structure and preoccupation with memory make it a Marker film. Upon release, the film was criticized for not addressing many current issues of the New Left such as the woman&#x27;s movement, sexual liberation and worker self-management. The film was re-released in the US in 2002.

In the late 1970s, Marker traveled extensively throughout the world, including an extended period in Japan. From this inspiration, he first published the photo-essay &quot;Le Dépays&quot; in 1982, and then used the experience for his next film &quot;Sans Soleil&quot;, released in 1982.

&quot;Sans Soleil&quot; stretches the limits of what could be called a documentary. It is an essay, a montage, mixing pieces of documentary with fiction and philosophical comments, creating an atmosphere of dream and science fiction. The main themes are Japan, Africa, memory and travel. A sequence in the middle of the film takes place in San Francisco, and heavily references Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Marker has said that &quot;Vertigo&quot; is the only film &quot;capable of portraying impossible memory, insane memory.&quot; The film&#x27;s commentary are credited to the fictitious cameraman Sandor Krasna, and read in the form of letters by an unnamed woman. Though centered around Japan, the film was also shot in such other countries as Guinea Bissau, Ireland and Iceland. &quot;Sans Soleil&quot; was shown at the 1983 Berlin Film Festival where it won the OCIC Award. It was also awarded the Sutherland Trophy at the 1983 British Film Institute Awards.

In 1984, Marker was invited by producer Serge Silberman to document the making of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Ran&quot;. From this Marker made &quot;A.K.&quot;, released in 1985. The film focuses more on Kurosawa&#x27;s remote but polite personality than on the making of the film. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, before &quot;Ran&quot; itself had been released.

In 1985, Marker&#x27;s long-time friend and neighbor Simone Signoret died of cancer. Marker then made the one-hour TV documentary &quot;Mémoires pour Simone&quot; as a tribute to her in 1986.

==Multimedia and later career (1987–2012)==

Beginning with &quot;Sans Soleil&quot;, Marker developed a deep interest in digital technology. From 1985 to 1988, he worked on a conversational program (a prototypical chatbot) called &quot;Dialector,&quot; which he wrote in Applesoft BASIC on an Apple II. He incorporated audiovisual elements in addition to the snippets of dialogue and poetry that &quot;Computer&quot; exchanged with the user. Version 6 of this program was revived from a floppy disk (with Marker&#x27;s help and permission) and emulated online in 2015.

His interests in digital technology also led to his film &quot;Level Five&quot; (1996) and &quot;Immemory&quot; (1998, 2008), an interactive multimedia CD-ROM, produced for the Centre Pompidou (French language version) and from Exact Change (English version). Marker created a 19-minute multimedia piece in 2005 for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City titled &quot;Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men&quot; which was influenced by T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem.

Marker lived in Paris, and very rarely granted interviews. One exception was a lengthy interview with &quot;Libération&quot; in 2003 in which he explained his approach to filmmaking. When asked for a picture of himself, he usually offered a photograph of a cat instead. (Marker was represented in Agnes Varda&#x27;s 2008 documentary &quot;The Beaches of Agnes&quot; by a cartoon drawing of a cat, speaking in a technologically altered voice.) Marker&#x27;s own cat was named &quot;Guillaume-en-égypte&quot;. In 2009, Marker commissioned an to represent him in machinima works. The avatar was created by Exosius Woolley and first appeared in the short film / machinima, &quot;Ouvroir the Movie by Chris Marker&quot;.

In the 2007 Criterion Collection release of &quot;La Jetée&quot; and &quot;Sans Soleil&quot;, Marker included a short essay, &quot;Working on a Shoestring Budget&quot;. He confessed to shooting all of &quot;Sans Soleil&quot; with a silent film camera, and recording all the audio on a primitive audio cassette recorder. Marker also reminds the reader that only one short scene in &quot;La Jetée&quot; is of a moving image, as Marker could only borrow a movie camera for one afternoon while working on the film.

From 2007 through 2011 Marker collaborated with the art dealer and publisher Peter Blum on a variety of projects that were exhibited at the Peter Blum galleries in New York City&#x27;s Soho and Chelsea neighborhoods. Marker&#x27;s works were also exhibited at the Peter Blum Gallery on 57th Street in 2014. These projects include several series of printed photographs titled &quot;PASSENGERS&quot;, &quot;Koreans&quot;, &quot;Crush Art&quot;, &quot;Quelle heure est-elle?&quot;, and &quot;Staring Back&quot;; a set of photogravures titled &quot;After Dürer&quot;; a book, &quot;PASSENGERS&quot;; and digital prints of movie posters, whose titles were often appropriated, including &quot;Breathless&quot;, &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;, &quot;Owl People&quot;, and &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot;. The video installations &quot;Silent Movie&quot; and &quot;Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men&quot; were exhibited at Peter Blum in 2009. These works were also exhibited at the 2014 &amp; 2015 Venice Biennale, Whitechapel Gallery in London, the MIT List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University, the Moscow Photobiennale, Les Recontres d&#x27;Arles de la Photographie in Arles, France, the Centre de la Photographie in Geneva, Switzerland, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California. Since 2014 the artworks of the Estate of Chris Marker are represented by Peter Blum Gallery, New York.

Marker died on 29 July 2012, his 91st birthday.

==Legacy==

&quot;La Jetée&quot; was the inspiration for Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s 1987 debut live action feature &quot;The Red Spectacles&quot; (and later for parts of Oshii&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Avalon&quot;) and also inspired Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995) and Jonás Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Nail&quot; (2007) as well as many of Mira Nair&#x27;s shots in her 2006 film &quot;The Namesake&quot;.

<doc id="6716" wikidata="Q893304" url="?curid=6716" title="Cardinal vowels">
<text>Cardinal vowels are a set of reference vowels used by phoneticians in describing the sounds of languages. They are classified depending on the position of the tongue relative to the roof of the mouth, how far forward or back is the highest point of the tongue, and the position of the lips (rounded or unrounded).

A cardinal vowel is a vowel sound produced when the tongue is in an extreme position, either front or back, high or low. The current system was systematised by Daniel Jones in the early 20th century, though the idea goes back to earlier phoneticians, notably Ellis and Bell.

==Table of cardinal vowels==

Three of the cardinal vowels—, and —have articulatory definitions. The vowel is produced with the tongue as far forward and as high in the mouth as is possible (without producing friction), with spread lips. The vowel is produced with the tongue as far back and as high in the mouth as is possible, with protruded lips. This sound can be approximated by adopting the posture to whistle a very low note, or to blow out a candle. And is produced with the tongue as low and as far back in the mouth as possible.

The other vowels are &#x27;auditorily equidistant&#x27; between these three &#x27;corner vowels&#x27;, at four degrees of aperture or &#x27;height&#x27;: close (high tongue position), close-mid, open-mid, and open (low tongue position).

These degrees of aperture plus the front-back distinction define eight reference points on a mixture of articulatory and auditory criteria. These eight vowels are known as the eight &#x27;primary cardinal vowels&#x27;, and vowels like these are common in the world&#x27;s languages.

The lip positions can be reversed with the lip position for the corresponding vowel on the opposite side of the front-back dimension, so that e.g. Cardinal 1 can be produced with rounding somewhat similar to that of Cardinal 8; these are known as &#x27;secondary cardinal vowels&#x27;. Sounds such as these are claimed to be less common in the world&#x27;s languages. Other vowel sounds are also recognised on the vowel chart of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Jones argued that to be able to use the cardinal vowel system effectively one must undergo training with an expert phonetician, working both on the recognition and the production of the vowels.

Cardinal vowels are not vowels of any particular language, but a measuring system. However, some languages contain vowel or vowels that are close to the cardinal vowel(s). An example of such language is Ngwe, which is spoken in Cameroon. It has been cited as a language with a vowel system that has eight vowels which are rather similar to the eight primary cardinal vowels (Ladefoged 1971:67).


Cardinal vowels 19–22 were added by David Abercrombie. In IPA Numbers, cardinal vowels 1–18 have the same numbers but added to 300.

==Limits on the accuracy of the system==
The usual explanation of the cardinal vowel system implies that the competent user can reliably distinguish between sixteen Primary and Secondary vowels plus a small number of central vowels. The provision of diacritics by the International Phonetic Association further implies that intermediate values may also be reliably recognized, so that a phonetician might be able to produce and recognize not only a close-mid front unrounded vowel and an open-mid front unrounded vowel but also a mid front unrounded vowel , a centralized mid front unrounded vowel , and so on. This suggests a range of vowels nearer to forty or fifty than to twenty in number. Empirical evidence for this ability in trained phoneticians is hard to come by.

Ladefoged, in a series of pioneering experiments published in the 1950s and 60s, studied how trained phoneticians coped with the vowels of a dialect of Scottish Gaelic. He asked eighteen phoneticians to listen to a recording of ten words spoken by a native speaker of Gaelic and to place the vowels on a cardinal vowel quadrilateral. He then studied the degree of agreement or disagreement among the phoneticians. Ladefoged himself drew attention to the fact that the phoneticians who were trained in the British tradition established by Daniel Jones were closer to each other in their judgments than those who had not had this training. However, the most striking result is the great divergence of judgments among &quot;all&quot; the listeners regarding vowels that were distant from Cardinal values.

<doc id="6719" wikidata="Q59670" url="?curid=6719" title="Columbia, Missouri">
<text>Columbia is a city in Missouri, United States. It was founded in 1821 as the county seat of Boone County and had a population of 126,254 as recorded in the 2020 United States census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Missouri. Columbia is a Midwestern college town, home to the University of Missouri, a major research institution also known as MU or Mizzou. In addition to the university and surrounding Downtown Columbia are Stephens College and Columbia College, giving the city its educational focus and nearly 40,000 college students. It is the principal city of the Columbia metropolitan area, population 215,811, and the central city of the nine-county Columbia–Jefferson City–Moberly combined statistical area with 415,747 residents. The city is the fastest-growing municipality in Missouri, with a growth of almost 40% since 2000, and a population estimated at 130,000 in 2024. Columbia is among the most-educated cities in the United States with about half of citizens being college graduates and about a quarter holding advance degrees.

The city is built on the oak-forested hills and rolling prairies of Mid-Missouri, near the Missouri River, where the Ozark Mountains transition into plains and savanna. At the city&#x27;s center is the Avenue of the Columns (8th Street), connecting Francis Quadrangle and Jesse Hall to the Boone County Courthouse and City Hall. Surrounding Columbia is a greenbelt including Rock Bridge Memorial State Park, Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area, the Mark Twain National Forest, Katy Trail State Park, Finger Lakes State Park, and the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Limestone bedrock forms bluffs and glades while rain dissolves the bedrock, creating karst (caves and springs) which water the Hinkson, Roche Perche, Flat Branch, and Bonne Femme creeks. Within city limits, there is an extensive city parks and trails system with a focus on non-motorized transportation, including the MKT Trail. The Columbia Agriculture Park is home to the nationally-regarded Columbia Farmers Market. 

Originally an agricultural town, education and healthcare are now Columbia&#x27;s primary economic concern, with secondary interests in the insurance, finance, and technology sectors. Companies founded in Columbia include: Carfax, Shelter Insurance, Veterans United Home Loans, MFA Incorporated, MFA Oil, Slackers CDs and Games, MidwayUSA, EquitmentShare, and Scripps News. The University of Missouri Health Care system operates six hospitals in Columbia, several clinics, and the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment. There is also the county-owned Boone Hospital Center, several smaller private hospitals, and the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans&#x27; Hospital, adjacent to University Hospital and MU School of Medicine. The University of Missouri nuclear reactor is the most-powerful research reactor in the United States and the sole supplier of important radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine.

Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of Missouri, the Museum of Art and Archaeology, the Missouri Symphony, the North Village Arts District, The Blue Note, the Missouri Theatre, The Conservatory of the Performing Arts at Stephens College, the Boone County Historical Society, Columbia Public Library, Ragtag Cinema and the annual True/False Film Festival, an internationally-known documentary festival. The Missouri Tigers, the state&#x27;s only major college athletic program, play football at Faurot Field and basketball at Mizzou Arena as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The city has been known as the &quot;Athens of Missouri&quot; for its educational emphasis and classic beauty, but is more commonly called &quot;CoMo&quot;.

==History==

The first humans entered the area at least 12,000 years ago were nomadic hunters. Thousands of years later, Woodland period tribes lived in villages near waterways and built mounds in high places. In the historical period, the Osage and Missouria nations were expelled by the exploration of French traders and the rapid settlement of American pioneers. The latter arrived by the Boone&#x27;s Lick Road and hailed from the culture of the Upland South, especially Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. From 1812, the Boonslick area of central Missouri played a pivotal role in Missouri&#x27;s early history and the nation&#x27;s westward expansion. 

Columbia&#x27;s origins begin with the settlement of American pioneers from Kentucky and Virginia in an early 1800s region known as the Boonslick. Before 1815 settlement in the region was confined to small log forts due to the threat of Native American attack during the War of 1812. When the war ended settlers came on foot, horseback, and wagon, often moving entire households along the Boone&#x27;s Lick Road and often bringing enslaved African Americans. By 1818 it was clear that the increased population would necessitate a new county be created from territorial Howard County. The Moniteau Creek on the west and Cedar Creek on the east were obvious natural boundaries.

Believing it was only a matter of time before a county seat was chosen, the Smithton Land Company was formed to purchase over to establish the village of Smithton (near the present-day intersection of Walnut and Garth). In 1819 Smithton was a small cluster of log cabins in an ancient forest of oak and hickory; chief among them was the cabin of Richard Gentry, a trustee of the Smithton Company who would become first mayor of Columbia. In 1820, Boone County was formed and named after the recently deceased explorer Daniel Boone. The Missouri Legislature appointed John Gray, Jefferson Fulcher, Absalom Hicks, Lawrence Bass, and David Jackson as commissioners to select and establish a permanent county seat. Smithton never had more than twenty people, and it was quickly realized that well digging was difficult because of the bedrock.

Springs were discovered across the Flat Branch Creek, so in the spring of 1821 Columbia was laid out, and the inhabitants of Smithton moved their cabins to the new town. The first house in Columbia was built by Thomas Duly in 1820 at what became Fifth and Broadway. Columbia&#x27;s permanence was ensured when it was chosen as county seat in 1821 and the Boone&#x27;s Lick Road was rerouted down Broadway.

The roots of Columbia&#x27;s three economic foundations—education, medicine, and insurance— can be traced to the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1821. Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College, distinct from today&#x27;s and later to become the University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any competing city, and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle. Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia, such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became Columbia College.

The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. In 1822, William Jewell set up the first hospital. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state&#x27;s first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which, at that time, included the City of St. Louis.

Columbia&#x27;s infrastructure was relatively untouched by the Civil War. As a slave state, Missouri had many residents with Southern sympathies, but it stayed in the Union. The majority of the city was pro-Union; however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia.

After Reconstruction, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern of increasing violence of whites against blacks in efforts to suppress voting and free movement: George Burke, a black man who worked at the university, was lynched in 1889. In the spring of 1923, James T. Scott, an African-American janitor at the University of Missouri, was arrested on allegations of raping a university professor&#x27;s daughter. He was taken from the county jail and lynched on April 29 before a white mob of roughly two thousand people, hanged from the Old Stewart Road Bridge.
In the 21st century, a number of efforts have been undertaken to recognize Scott&#x27;s death. In 2010 his death certificate was changed to reflect that he was never tried or convicted of charges, and that he had been lynched. In 2011 a headstone was put at his grave at Columbia Cemetery; it includes his wife&#x27;s and parents&#x27; names and dates, to provide a more full account of his life. In 2016, a marker was erected at the lynching site to memorialize Scott. 5 years later, in 2021, the marker was removed in an act of vandalism. 
In 1901, Rufus Logan established &quot;The Columbia Professional&quot; newspaper to serve Columbia&#x27;s large African American population.

In 1963, University of Missouri System and the Columbia College system established their headquarters in Columbia. The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including Shelter Insurance, Missouri Employers Mutual, and Columbia Insurance Group. State Farm Insurance has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now-defunct Silvey Insurance was a large local employer.

Columbia became a transportation crossroads when U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 (which was improved as present-day Interstate 70) were routed through the city. Soon after, the city opened the Columbia Regional Airport. By 2000, the city&#x27;s population was nearly 85,000.

In 2017, Columbia was in the path of totality for the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. The city was expecting upwards of 400,000 tourists coming to view the eclipse.

==Geography==
Columbia, in northern mid-Missouri, is away from both St. Louis and Kansas City, and north of the state capital of Jefferson City. The city is near the Missouri River, between the Ozark Plateau and the Northern Plains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Topography===
The city generally slopes from the highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park just south of the city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.

===Animal life===
Large mammals found in the city include urbanized coyotes, red foxes, and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally be seen on the MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife. 

The Devil&#x27;s Icebox Cave in Columbia&#x27;s Rock Bridge State Park is the only natural home of the planarian &quot;Kenkia glandulosa,&quot; an eyeless and de-pigmented flatworm. The cave is also home to species of salamanders, frogs, &quot;troglobites&quot;, millipede, spiders, bats, and springtail.

===Climate===
Columbia has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa)&quot; marked by sharp seasonal contrasts in temperature, and is in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6a. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the high reaches or exceeds on an average of 35 days per year, on two days, while two nights of sub- lows can be expected. Precipitation tends to be greatest and most frequent in the latter half of spring, when severe weather is also most common. Snow averages per season, mostly from December to March, with occasional November accumulation and falls in April being rarer; historically seasonal snow accumulation has ranged from in 2005–06 to in 1977–78. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on February 12, 1899 to on July 12 and 14, 1954. Readings of or are uncommon, the last occurrences being January 7, 2014 and July 31, 2012.
==Cityscape==

Columbia&#x27;s most significant and well-known architecture is found in buildings located in its downtown area and on the university campuses. The University of Missouri&#x27;s Jesse Hall and the neo-Gothic Memorial Union have become icons of the city. The David R. Francis Quadrangle is an example of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s academic village concept.

Nine historic districts located within the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Downtown Columbia, the East Campus neighborhood, the West Broadway neighborhood, the Francis Quadrangle, the south campus of Stephens College, the Pierce Pennant Motor Hotel, Maplewood, and the David Guitar House. The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel and the 15-story Paquin Tower.

Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, Stephens College to the east, and Columbia College on the north. The area serves as Columbia&#x27;s financial and business district.
Since the early-21st century, a large number of high-rise apartment complexes have been built in downtown Columbia. Many of these buildings also offer mixed-use business and retail space on the lower levels. These developments have not been without criticism, with some expressing concern the buildings hurt the historic feel of the area, or that the city does not yet have the infrastructure to support them.

The city&#x27;s historic residential core lies in a ring around downtown, extending especially to the west along Broadway, and south into the East Campus Neighborhood. The city government recognizes 63 neighborhood associations. The city&#x27;s most dense commercial areas are primarily along Interstate 70, U.S. Route 63, Stadium Boulevard, Grindstone Parkway, and Downtown.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
The 2020 United States census counted 126,254 people, 49,371 households, and 25,144 families in Columbia. The population density was . There were 53,746 housing units at an average density of .

However, traditional statistics of income and poverty can be misleading when applied to cities with high student populations, such as Columbia.

==Economy==
Columbia&#x27;s economy is historically dominated by education, healthcare, and insurance. Jobs in government are also common, either in Columbia or a half-hour south in Jefferson City. The Columbia Regional Airport and the Missouri River Port of Rocheport connect the region with trade and transportation.

With a Gross Metropolitan Product of $9.6 billion in 2018, Columbia&#x27;s economy makes up 3% of the Gross State Product of Missouri. Columbia&#x27;s metro area economy is slightly larger than the economy of Rwanda. Insurance corporations headquartered in Columbia include Shelter Insurance and the Columbia Insurance Group. Other organizations include StorageMart, Veterans United Home Loans, MFA Incorporated, the Missouri State High School Activities Association, and MFA Oil. Companies such as Socket, Datastorm Technologies, Inc. (no longer existent), Slackers CDs and Games, Carfax, and MBS Textbook Exchange were all founded in Columbia.

===Top employers===
According to Columbia&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Culture==

The Missouri Theatre Center for the Arts and Jesse Auditorium are Columbia&#x27;s largest fine arts venues. Ragtag Cinema annually hosts the True/False Film Festival.

In 2008, filmmaker Todd Sklar completed the film &quot;Box Elder&quot;, which was filmed entirely in and around Columbia and the University of Missouri.

The North Village Arts District, located on the north side of downtown, is home to galleries, restaurants, theaters, bars, music venues, and the Mareck Center for Dance.

The University of Missouri&#x27;s Museum of Art and Archaeology displays 14,000 works of art and archaeological objects in five galleries for no charge to the public. Libraries include the Columbia Public Library, the University of Missouri Libraries, with over three million volumes in Ellis Library, and the State Historical Society of Missouri.

===Music===

===Theater===
Columbia has multiple opportunities to watch and perform in theatrical productions. Ragtag Cinema is one of the most well known theaters in Columbia. The city is home to Stephens College, a private institution known for performing arts. Their season includes multiple plays and musicals. The University of Missouri and Columbia College also present multiple productions a year.
The city&#x27;s three public high schools are also known for their productions. Rock Bridge High School performs a musical in November and two plays in the spring. Hickman High School also performs a similar season with two musical performances (one in the fall, and one in the spring) and 2 plays (one in the winter, and one at the end of their school year). The newest high school, Battle High, opened in 2013 and also is known for their productions. Battle presents a musical in the fall and a play in the spring, along with improv nights and more productions throughout the year.

The city is also home to the indoor/outdoor theatre Maplewood Barn Theatre in Nifong Park and other community theatre programs such as Columbia Entertainment Company, Talking Horse Productions, Pace Youth Theatre and TRYPS.

===Sports===

The University of Missouri&#x27;s sports teams, the Missouri Tigers, play a significant role in the city&#x27;s sports culture. Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium, which has a capacity of 62,621, hosts home football games. The Hearnes Center and Mizzou Arena are two other large sport and event venues, the latter being the home arena for Mizzou&#x27;s basketball team.

In 2007, Columbia hosted the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Volleyball National Championship, which the Lady Cougars participated in.

Columbia also hosts the Show-Me State Games, a non-profit program of the Missouri Governor&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Health. They are the largest state games in the United States.

Situated midway between St. Louis and Kansas City, Columbians will often have allegiances to the professional sports teams housed there, such as the St. Louis Cardinals, the Kansas City Royals, the Kansas City Chiefs, the St. Louis Blues, Sporting Kansas City, and St. Louis City SC.

===Cuisine===
Columbia has many bars and restaurants that provide diverse styles of cuisine, due in part to having three colleges. The oldest is the historic Booches bar, restaurant, and pool hall, which was established in 1884 and is frequented by college students. Shakespeare&#x27;s Pizza was founded in Columbia and is known for its college town pizza.

== Parks and recreation ==

Throughout the city are many parks and trails for public usage. Among the more popularly frequented is the MKT which is a spur that connects to the Katy Trail, meeting up just south of Columbia proper. The MKT ranked second in the nation for &quot;Best Urban Trail&quot; in the 2015 &quot;USA Today&quot;″s 10 Best Readers&#x27; Choice Awards. This 10-foot wide trail built on the old railbed of the MKT railroad begins in downtown Columbia in Flat Branch Park at 4th and Cherry Streets. The all-weather crushed limestone surface provides opportunities for walking, jogging, running, and bicycling.

Stephens Lake Park is the highlight of Columbia&#x27;s park system and is known for its 11-acre fishing/swimming lake, mature trees, and historical significance in the community. It serves as the center for outdoor winter sports, a variety of community festivals such as the Roots N Blues Festival, and outdoor concert series at the amphitheater. Stephens Lake has reservable shelters, playgrounds, swimming beach and spraygrounds, art sculptures, waterfalls, and walking trails. Rock Bridge Memorial State Park is open year-round giving visitors the chance to scramble, hike, and bicycle through a scenic environment. Rock Bridge State Park contains some of the most popular hiking trails in the state, including the Gans Creek Wild Area.

Columbia is home to Harmony Bends Disc Golf Course (https://www.como.gov/contacts/harmony-bends-championship-disc-golf-course-strawn-park/), which was named the 2017 Disc Golf Course of the Year by DGCourseReview.com.

==Media==

The city has two daily morning newspapers: the &quot;Columbia Missourian&quot; and the &quot;Columbia Daily Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Missourian&quot; is directed by professional editors and staffed by Missouri School of Journalism students who do reporting, design, copy editing, information graphics, photography, and multimedia. The &quot;Missourian&quot; publishes the monthly city magazine, &quot;Vox Magazine&quot;. The University of Missouri has the independent official bi-weekly student newspaper called &quot;The Maneater&quot;, and the quarterly literary magazine, &quot;The Missouri Review&quot;.

==Government and politics==
Columbia&#x27;s current government was established by a home rule charter adopted by voters on November 11, 1974, which established a council-manager government that invested power in the city council. The city council has seven members: six elected by each of Columbia&#x27;s six single-member districts or wards and an at-large member, the mayor, who is elected by all city voters. The mayor receives a $9,000 annual stipend, and the six other members receive a $6,000 annual stipend. They are elected to staggered three-year terms. As well as serving as a voting member of the city council, the mayor is recognized as the head of city government for ceremonial purposes. Chief executive authority is invested in a hired city manager, who oversees the government&#x27;s day-to-day operations.

Columbia is the county seat of Boone County, and houses the county court and government center. The city is in Missouri&#x27;s 4th congressional district. The 19th Missouri State Senate district covers all of Boone County. There are five Missouri House of Representatives districts (9, 21, 23, 24, and 25) in the city. The Columbia Police Department provides law enforcement across the city, while the Columbia Fire Department provides fire protection. The University of Missouri Police Department also patrols areas on and around the University of Missouri campus and has jurisdiction throughout the state. Additionally, the Boone County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the law enforcement agency for the county, regularly patrols the city. The Public Service Joint Communications Center coordinates efforts between the two organizations as well as the Boone County Fire Protection District, which operates Urban Search and Rescue Missouri Task Force 1.
The population generally supports progressive causes, such as recycling programs and the decriminalization of cannabis both for medical and recreational use at the municipal level, though the scope of the latter of the two cannabis ordinances has since been restricted. The city is one of only four in the state to offer medical benefits to same-sex partners of city employees. The new health plan extends health benefits to unmarried heterosexual domestic partners of city employees.

On October 10, 2006, the city council approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars. The ordinance was passed over protest, and several amendments to the ordinance reflect this. Over half of residents possess at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, while over a quarter hold a graduate degree. Columbia is the 13th most-highly educated municipality in the United States.

In February 2024, the Columbia City Council voted to legally make and declare the entire city a safe haven for transgender people and cisgender homosexuals.

==Education==
Almost all of the Columbia city limits, and much of the surrounding area, lies within the Columbia Public School District. The district enrolled more than 18,000 students and had a budget of $281 million for the 2019–20 school year.

95.4% of adults age 25 and older in the city have a high school diploma. In 2022, Columbia Public Schools recorded a 67.7% attendance rate, lower than the state average of 76.2%. Last year&#x27;s graduation rate for the class of 2022 was 90%, while the class of 2021&#x27;s graduation rate was reported at 89%. According to statewide numbers for 2022, Missouri&#x27;s overall graduation rate was 91.16%. The Columbia school district operates four public high schools which cover grades 9–12: David H. Hickman High School, Rock Bridge High School, Muriel Battle High School, and Frederick Douglass High School. Rock Bridge is one of two Missouri high schools to receive a silver medal by U.S. News &amp; World Report, putting it in the Top 3% of all high schools in the nation. Hickman has been on Newsweek magazine&#x27;s list of Top 1,300 schools in the country for the past three years and has more named presidential scholars than any other public high school in the US. There are also several private high schools located in the city, including Christian Fellowship School, Columbia Independent School, Heritage Academy, Christian Chapel Academy, and Tolton High School.

CPS also manages seven middle schools: Jefferson, West, Oakland, Gentry, Smithton, Lange, and John Warner. John Warner Middle School first opened for the 2020/21 school year.

A very small portion of the city limits is in Hallsville R-IV School District. The sole high school of that district is Hallsville High School.

The United States census estimated that 55.3% of adults ages 25 and up in Columbia hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. While only 31.2% of Missourians hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The city has three institutions of higher education: the University of Missouri, Stephens College, and Columbia College, all of which surround Downtown Columbia. The city is the headquarters of the University of Missouri System, which operates campuses in St. Louis, Kansas City, and Rolla. Moberly Area Community College, Central Methodist University, and William Woods University as well as operates satellite campuses in Columbia.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The Columbia Transit provides public bus and para-transit service, and is owned and operated by the city. In 2008, 1,414,400 passengers boarded along the system&#x27;s six fixed routes and nine University of Missouri shuttle routes, and 27,000 boarded the Para-transit service. The system is constantly experiencing growth in service and technology. A $3.5 million project to renovate and expand the Wabash Station, a rail depot built in 1910 and converted into the city&#x27;s transit center in the mid-1980s, was completed in summer of 2007. In 2007, a Transit Master Plan was created to address the future transit needs of the city and county with a comprehensive plan to add infrastructure in three key phases. The five to 15-year plan intends to add service along the southwest, southeast and northeast sections of Columbia and develop alternative transportation models for Boone County.

The city is served by Columbia Regional Airport. The closest rail station is Jefferson City station, in the state capital Jefferson City.

Columbia is also known for its MKT Trail, a spur of the Katy Trail State Park, which allows foot and bike traffic across the city, and, conceivably, the state. It consists of a soft gravel surface for running and biking. Columbia also is preparing to embark on construction of several new bike paths and street bike lanes thanks to a $25 million grant from the federal government. The city is also served by American Airlines at the Columbia Regional Airport, the only commercial airport in mid-Missouri.

I-70 (concurrent with US 40) and US 63 are the two main freeways used for travel to and from Columbia. Within the city, there are also three state highways: Routes 763 (Rangeline Street &amp; College Avenue), 163 (Providence Road), and 740 (Stadium Boulevard).

Rail service is provided by the city-owned Columbia Terminal Railroad (COLT), which runs from the north side of Columbia to Centralia and a connection to the Norfolk Southern Railway.

===Health systems===

Health care is a big part of Columbia&#x27;s economy, with nearly one in six people working in a health-care related profession and a physician density that is about three times the United States average. The city&#x27;s hospitals and supporting facilities are a large referral center for the state, and medical related trips to the city are common. There are three hospital systems within the city and five hospitals with a total of 1,105 beds.

The University of Missouri Health Care operates three hospitals in Columbia: the University of Missouri Hospital, the University of Missouri Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital (formerly Columbia Regional Hospital), and the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center. Boone Hospital Center is administered by BJC Healthcare and operates several clinics as well as outpatient locations. The Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans&#x27; Hospital, adjacent to University Hospital, is administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

There are a large number of medical-related industries in Columbia. The University of Missouri School of Medicine uses university-owned facilities as teaching hospitals. The University of Missouri Research Reactor Center is the largest research reactor in the United States and produces radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. The center serves as the sole supplier of the active ingredients in two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved radiopharmaceuticals and produces Fluorine-18 used in PET imaging with its cyclotron.

<text>Charlton Athletic Football Club is a professional association football club based in Charlton, south-east London, England. The team compete in , the third level of the English football league system. 

Their home ground is The Valley, where the club have played since 1919. They also played at The Mount in Catford during the 1923–24 season, and spent seven years at Selhurst Park and the Boleyn Ground between 1985 and 1992, because of financial issues, and then safety concerns raised by the local council. The club&#x27;s traditional kit consists of red shirts, white shorts and red socks, and their most commonly used nickname is &quot;The Addicks&quot;. Charlton share local rivalries with fellow South London clubs Crystal Palace and Millwall.

The club was founded on 9 June 1905 and turned professional in 1920. They spent one season in the Kent League and one season in the Southern League, before being invited to join the newly-formed Football League Third Division South in 1921. They won the division in the 1928–29 season, and again in 1934–35 following relegation in 1933. Charlton were promoted out of the Second Division in 1935–36, and finished second in the First Division the next season. Having been beaten finalists in 1946, they lifted the FA Cup the following year with a 1–0 victory over Burnley. The departure of Jimmy Seed in 1956, manager for 23 years, saw the club relegated out of the top-flight the following year. Relegated again in 1972, Charlton were promoted from the Third Division in 1974–75, and again in 1980–81 following relegation the previous season.

Charlton recovered from administration to secure promotion back to the First Division in 1985–86, and went on to lose in the 1987 final of the Full Members&#x27; Cup, though they won the 1987 play-off final to retain their top-flight status. Having been relegated in 1990, Charlton won the 1998 play-off final to make their debut in the Premier League. Though they were relegated the next year, manager Alan Curbishley took them back up as champions in 1999–2000. Charlton spent seven successive years in the Premier League, before suffering two relegations in three years. They won League One with 101 points in 2011–12, though were relegated from the Championship in 2016, and again in 2020 after they won the 2019 League One play-off final.

==History==
===Early history (1905–1946)===
Charlton Athletic was formed on 9 June 1905 by a group of 14 to 15-year-olds in East Street, Charlton, which is now known as Eastmoor Street and no longer residential.

Contrary to some histories, the club was founded as &quot;Charlton Athletic&quot; and had no connection to other teams or institutions such as East St Mission, Blundell Mission or Charlton Reds; it was not founded by a church, school, employer or as a franchise for an existing ground. Charlton spent most of the years before the First World War playing in local leagues but progressing rapidly, winning successive leagues and so promotions eight years in a row. In 1905–06 the team played only friendly games but joined, and won, the Lewisham League Division III for the 1906–07 season. For the 1907–08 season the team contested the Lewisham League, Woolwich League and entered the Woolwich Cup. It was also around this time the Addicks nickname was first used in the local press although it may have been in use before then. In the 1908–09 season Charlton Athletic were playing in the Blackheath and District League and by 1910–11 had progressed to the Southern Suburban League. During this period Charlton Athletic won the Woolwich Cup four times, the championship of the Woolwich League three times, won the Blackheath League twice and the Southern Suburban League three times.

They became a senior side in 1913, the same year that nearby Woolwich Arsenal F.C. relocated to North London.

At the outbreak of World War I, Charlton were one of the first clubs to close down to take part in the &quot;Greater Game&quot; overseas. The club was reformed in 1917, playing mainly friendlies to raise funds for charities connected to the war and for the Woolwich Memorial Hospital Cup, the trophy for which Charlton donated. It had previously been the Woolwich Cup that the team had won outright following three consecutive victories.

After the war, they joined the Kent League for one season (1919–20) before becoming professional, appointing Walter Rayner as the first full-time manager. They were accepted by the Southern League and played just a single season (1920–21) before being voted into the Football League. Charlton&#x27;s first Football League match was against Exeter City in August 1921, which they won 1–0. In 1923, Charlton became &quot;giant killers&quot; in the FA Cup beating top flight sides Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, and Preston North End before losing to eventual winners Bolton Wanderers in the Quarter-Finals. Later that year, it was proposed that Charlton merge with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support. In the 1923–24 season Charlton played in Catford at The Mount stadium and wore the colours of &quot;The Enders&quot;, light and dark blue vertical stripes. However, the move fell through and the Addicks returned to the Charlton area in 1924, returning to the traditional red and white colours in the process.

Charlton finished second bottom in the Football League in 1926 and were forced to apply for re-election which was successful. Three years later the Addicks won the Division Three championship in 1929&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1928/29&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and they remained at the Division Two level for four years. After relegation into the Third Division south at the end of the 1932–33 season the club appointed Jimmy Seed as manager and he oversaw the most successful period in Charlton&#x27;s history either side of World War II. Seed, an ex-miner who had made a career as a footballer despite suffering the effects of poison gas in the First World War, remains the most successful manager in Charlton&#x27;s history. He is commemorated in the name of a stand at the Valley. Seed was an innovative thinker about the game at a time when tactical formations were still relatively unsophisticated. He later recalled &quot;a simple scheme that enabled us to pull several matches out of the fire&quot; during the 1934–35 season: when the team was in trouble &quot;the centre-half was to forsake his defensive role and go up into the attack to add weight to the five forwards.&quot; The organisation Seed brought to the team proved effective and the Addicks gained successive promotions from the Third Division to the First Division between 1934 and 1936, becoming the first club to ever do so. Charlton finally secured promotion to the First Division by beating local rivals West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground, with their centre-half John Oakes playing on despite concussion and a broken nose.

In 1937, Charlton finished runners up in the First Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;1936/1937 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938 finished fourth&lt;ref name=&quot;1937/1938 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 1939 finished third.&lt;ref name=&quot;1938/1939 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were the most consistent team in the top flight of English football over the three seasons immediately before World War II. This continued during the war years and they won the Football League War Cup and appeared in finals.

===Post-war success and fall from grace (1946–1984)===
Charlton reached the 1946 FA Cup Final, but lost 4–1 to Derby County at Wembley. Charlton&#x27;s Bert Turner scored an own goal in the 80th minute before equalising for the Addicks a minute later to take them into extra time, but they conceded three further goals in the extra period. When the full league programme resumed in 1946–47 Charlton could finish only 19th in the First Division, just above the relegation spots, but they made amends with their performance in the FA Cup, reaching the 1947 FA Cup Final. This time they were successful, beating Burnley 1–0, with Chris Duffy scoring the only goal of the day. In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only 13 English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season. The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000. However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club&#x27;s growth. In 1956, the then board undermined Jimmy Seed and asked for his resignation; Charlton were relegated the following year.

From the late 1950s until the early 1970s, Charlton remained a mainstay of the Second Division before relegation to the Third Division in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1971/72&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It caused the team&#x27;s support to drop, and even a promotion in 1975 back to the second division&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1974/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; did little to re-invigorate the team&#x27;s support and finances. In 1979–80 Charlton were relegated again to the Third Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1979/80&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but won immediate promotion back to the Second Division in 1980–81.&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1980/81&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was a turning point in the club&#x27;s history leading to a period of turbulence and change including further promotion and exile. A change in management and shortly after a change in club ownership led to severe problems, such as the reckless signing of former European Footballer of the Year Allan Simonsen, and the club looked like it would go out of business.

===The &quot;exiled&quot; years (1985–1992)===
In 1984 financial matters came to a head and the club went into administration, to be reformed as Charlton Athletic (1984) Ltd. although the club&#x27;s finances were still far from secure. They were forced to leave the Valley just after the start of the 1985–86 season, after its safety was criticised by Football League officials in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire.
The club began to ground-share with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and this arrangement looked to be for the long-term, as Charlton did not have enough funds to revamp the Valley to meet safety requirements.
Despite the move away from the Valley, Charlton were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up at the end of 1985–86,&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1985/86&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and remained at this level for four years (achieving a highest league finish of 14th) often with late escapes, most notably against Leeds in 1987, where the Addicks triumphed in extra-time of the play-off final replay to secure their top flight place. In 1987 Charlton also returned to Wembley for the first time since the 1947 FA Cup final for the Full Members Cup final against Blackburn.
Eventually, Charlton were relegated in 1990 along with Sheffield Wednesday and bottom club Millwall. Manager Lennie Lawrence remained in charge for one more season before he accepted an offer to take charge of Middlesbrough. He was replaced by joint player-managers Alan Curbishley and Steve Gritt. The pair had unexpected success in their first season finishing just outside the play-offs, and 1992–93 began promisingly and Charlton looked good bets for promotion in the new Division One (the new name of the old Second Division following the formation of the Premier League). However, the club was forced to sell players such as Rob Lee to help pay for a return to the Valley, while club fans formed the Valley Party, nominating candidates to stand in local elections in 1990, pressing the local council to enable the club&#x27;s return to the Valley – finally achieved in December 1992.

In March 1993, defender Tommy Caton, who had been out of action because of injury since January 1991, announced his retirement from playing on medical advice. He died suddenly at the end of the following month at the age of 30.

===Premier League years (1998–2007)===
In 1995, new chairman Richard Murray appointed Alan Curbishley as sole manager of Charlton. Under his sole leadership Charlton made an appearance in the play-off in 1996 but were eliminated by Crystal Palace in the semi-finals and the following season brought a disappointing 15th-place finish. 1997–98 was Charlton&#x27;s best season for years. They reached the Division One play-off final and battled against Sunderland in a thrilling game which ended with a 4–4 draw after extra time. Charlton won 7–6 on penalties, with the match described as &quot;arguably the most dramatic game of football in Wembley&#x27;s history&quot;, and were promoted to the Premier League.

Charlton&#x27;s first Premier League campaign began promisingly (they went top after two games) but they were unable to keep up their good form and were soon battling relegation. The battle was lost on the final day of the season but the club&#x27;s board kept faith in Curbishley, confident that they could bounce back. Curbishley rewarded the chairman&#x27;s loyalty with the Division One title in 2000 which signalled a return to the Premier League.

After the club&#x27;s return, Curbishley proved an astute spender and by 2003 he had succeeded in establishing Charlton in the top flight. Charlton spent much of the 2003–04 Premier League season challenging for a Champions League place, but a late-season slump in form and the sale of star player Scott Parker to Chelsea, left Charlton in seventh place, which was still the club&#x27;s highest finish since the 1950s. Charlton were unable to build on this level of achievement and Curbishley departed in 2006, with the club still established as a solid mid-table side.

In May 2006, Iain Dowie was named as Curbishley&#x27;s successor, but was sacked after 12 league matches in November 2006, with only two wins. Les Reed replaced Dowie as manager, however he too failed to improve Charlton&#x27;s position in the league table and on Christmas Eve 2006, Reed was replaced by former player Alan Pardew. Although results did improve, Pardew was unable to keep Charlton up and relegation was confirmed in the penultimate match of the season.

===Return to the Football League (2007–2014)===
Charlton&#x27;s return to the second tier of English football was a disappointment, with their promotion campaign tailing off to an 11th-place finish. Early in the following season the Addicks were linked with a foreign takeover, but this was swiftly denied by the club. On 10 October 2008, Charlton received an indicative offer for the club from a Dubai-based diversified investment company. However, the deal later fell through. The full significance of this soon became apparent as the club recorded net losses of over £13 million for that financial year. Pardew left on 22 November after a 2–5 home loss to Sheffield United that saw the team fall into the relegation places. Matters did not improve under caretaker manager Phil Parkinson, and the team went a club record 18 games without a win, a new club record, before finally achieving a 1–0 away victory over Norwich City in an FA Cup third round replay; Parkinson was hired on a permanent basis. The team were relegated to League One after a 2–2 draw against Blackpool on 18 April 2009.

After spending almost the entire 2009–10 season in the top six of League One, Charlton were defeated in the Football League One play-offs semi-final second leg on penalties against Swindon Town.
After a change in ownership, Parkinson and Charlton legend Mark Kinsella left after a poor run of results. Another Charlton legend, Chris Powell, was appointed manager of the club in January 2011, winning his first game in charge 2–0 over Plymouth at the Valley. This was Charlton&#x27;s first league win since November. Powell&#x27;s bright start continued with a further three victories, before running into a downturn which saw the club go 11 games in succession without a win. Yet the fans&#x27; respect for Powell saw him come under remarkably little criticism. The club&#x27;s fortunes picked up towards the end of the season, but leaving them far short of the play-offs. In a busy summer, Powell brought in 19 new players and after a successful season, on 14 April 2012, Charlton Athletic won promotion back to the Championship with a 1–0 away win at Carlisle United. A week later, on 21 April 2012, they were confirmed as champions after a 2–1 home win over Wycombe Wanderers. Charlton then lifted the League One trophy on 5 May 2012, having been in the top position since 15 September 2011, and after recording a 3–2 victory over Hartlepool United, recorded their highest ever league points score of 101, the highest in any professional European league that year.

In the first season back in the Championship, the 2012–13 season saw Charlton finish ninth place with 65 points, just three points short of the play-off places to the Premier League.

===Duchâtelet&#x27;s ownership (2014–2019)===
In early January 2014 during the 2013–14 season, Belgian businessman Roland Duchâtelet took over Charlton as owner in a deal worth £14million. This made Charlton a part of a network of football clubs owned by Duchâtelet. On 11 March 2014, two days after an FA Cup quarter-final loss to Sheffield United, and with Charlton sitting bottom of the table, Powell was sacked, private emails suggesting a rift with the owner.

New manager Jose Riga, despite having to join Charlton long after the transfer window had closed, was able to improve Charlton&#x27;s form and eventually guide them to 18th place, successfully avoiding relegation. After Riga&#x27;s departure to manage Blackpool, former Millwall player Bob Peeters was appointed as manager in May 2014 on a 12-month contract. Charlton started strong, but a long run of draws meant that after only 25 games in charge Peeters was dismissed with the team in 14th place. His replacement, Guy Luzon, ensured there was no relegation battle by winning most of the remaining matches, resulting in a 12th-place finish.

The 2015–16 season began promisingly but results under Luzon deteriorated and on 24 October 2015 after a 3–0 defeat at home to Brentford he was sacked. Luzon said in a &quot;News Shopper&quot; interview that he &quot;was not the one who chose how to do the recruitment&quot; as the reason why he failed as manager. Karel Fraeye was appointed &quot;interim head coach&quot;, but was sacked after 14 games and just two wins, with the club then second from bottom in the Championship. On 14 January 2016, Jose Riga was appointed head coach for a second spell, but could not prevent Charlton from being relegated to League One for the 2016–17 season. Riga resigned at the end of the season. To many fans, the managerial changes and subsequent relegation to League One were symptomatic of the mismanagement of the club under Duchâtelet&#x27;s ownership and several protests began.

After a slow start to the new season, with the club in 15th place of League One, the club announced that it had &quot;parted company&quot; with Russell Slade in November 2016. Karl Robinson was appointed on a permanent basis soon after. He led the Addicks to an uneventful 13th-place finish. The following season Robinson had the team challenging for the play-offs, but a drop in form in March led him to resign by mutual consent. He was replaced by former player Lee Bowyer as caretaker manager who guided them to a 6th-place finish, but lost in the play-off semi-final.

Bowyer was appointed permanently in September on a one-year contract and managed Charlton to third place in the 2018–19 EFL League One season, qualifying for the play-offs. In their first visit to the New Wembley Stadium and a repeat of their famous match in 1998, Charlton beat Sunderland 2–1 in the League One play-off final to earn promotion back to the EFL Championship after a three-season absence. Bowyer later signed a new one-year contract following promotion, which was later extended to three years in January 2020.

===Multiple changes of ownership (2019–present)===
====ESI (2019–2020)====
On 29 November 2019, Charlton Athletic were acquired by East Street Investments (ESI) from Abu Dhabi, subject to EFL approval. Approval was reportedly granted on 2 January 2020. However, on 10 March 2020, a public disagreement between the new owners erupted along with reports that the main investor was pulling out, and the EFL said the takeover had not been approved. The Valley and Charlton&#x27;s training ground were still owned by Duchâtelet, and a transfer embargo was in place as the new owners had not provided evidence of funding through to June 2021. On 20 April 2020, the EFL said the club was being investigated for misconduct regarding the takeover. In June 2020, Charlton confirmed that ESI had been taken over by a consortium led by businessman Paul Elliott, and said it had contacted the EFL to finalise the ownership change. However, a legal dispute involving former ESI director Matt Southall continued. He attempted to regain control of the club to prevent Elliott&#x27;s takeover from going ahead, but failed and was subsequently fined and dismissed for challenging the club&#x27;s directors. On 7 August 2020, the EFL said three individuals, including ESI owner Elliott and lawyer Chris Farnell, had failed its Owners&#x27; and Directors&#x27; Test, leaving the club&#x27;s ownership unclear; Charlton appealed against the decision. Meanwhile, Charlton were relegated to League One at the end of the 2019–20 season after finishing 22nd. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the final games of the season were played behind closed doors, which remained the case for the majority of the following season.

Later in August, Thomas Sandgaard, a Danish businessman based in Colorado, was reported to be negotiating to buy the club. After further court hearings, Elliott was granted an injunction blocking the sale of ESI until a hearing in November 2020.

====Thomas Sandgaard (2020–2023)====
On 25 September 2020, Thomas Sandgaard acquired the club itself from ESI, and was reported to have passed the EFL&#x27;s Owners&#x27; and Directors&#x27; Tests; the EFL noted the change in control, but said the club&#x27;s sale was now &quot;a matter for the interested parties&quot;.

On 15 March 2021, with the club lying in eighth place, Bowyer resigned as club manager and was appointed manager of Birmingham City. His successor, Nigel Adkins, was appointed three days later. The club finished the 2020–21 season in seventh place, but started the following season by winning only two out of 13 League One matches and were in the relegation zone when Adkins was sacked on 21 October 2021. 

After a successful spell as caretaker manager, Johnnie Jackson was appointed manager in December 2021, but, after Charlton finished the season in 13th place, he was also sacked. Swindon Town manager Ben Garner was appointed as his replacement in June 2022, but was sacked on 5 December 2022 with the team in 17th place. After the club was knocked out of the FA Cup by League Two side Stockport County on 7 December, supporters said Charlton was at its &quot;lowest ebb in living memory&quot;, with fans &quot;losing confidence&quot; in owner Thomas Sandgaard. Dean Holden was appointed manager on 20 December 2022, and Charlton improved to finish the 2022–23 season in 10th place.

====SE7 Partners (2023–present)====
On 5 June 2023, the club announced that SE7 Partners, comprising former Sunderland director Charlie Methven and Edward Warrick, had agreed a takeover of Charlton Athletic, becoming the club&#x27;s fourth set of owners in under four years. On 19 July, the EFL and FA cleared SE7 Partners to take over the club, and the deal was completed on 21 July 2023. On 27 August 2023, after one win in the opening six games of the 2023–24 season, Holden was sacked as manager, and succeeded by Michael Appleton. On 23 January 2024, following a 3–2 defeat at The Valley against Northampton Town - and no wins in 10 League One games - Appleton was sacked. He was replaced on 4 February 2024 by Nathan Jones, under whom Charlton lost one and drew three of their next four games as they matched the club&#x27;s longest winless streak of 18 games. The winless run ended with a 2–1 win away to Derby County on 27 February 2024. Charlton then went on a 14 match unbeaten run, the club&#x27;s longest in 24 years. However, Charlton finished the season in 16th place, their worst finishing league position in 98 years. Despite a disappointing campaign for the Addicks, Charlton striker Alfie May won the League One Golden Boot award for the 2023–24 season, with his tally of 23 goals.

==Club identity==
===Colours and crest===
Charlton have used a number of crests and badges during their history, although the current design has not been changed since 1968. The first known badge, from the 1930s, consisted of the letters CAF in the shape of a club from a pack of cards. In the 1940s, Charlton used a design featuring a robin sitting in a football within a shield, sometimes with the letters CAFC in the four-quarters of the shield, which was worn for the 1946 FA Cup Final. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the crest of the former metropolitan borough of Greenwich was used as a symbol for the club but this was not used on the team&#x27;s shirts.

In 1963, a competition was held to find a new badge for the club, and the winning entry was a hand holding a sword, which complied with Charlton&#x27;s nickname of the time, the Valiants. Over the next five years modifications were made to this design, such as the addition of a circle surrounding the hand and sword and including the club&#x27;s name in the badge. By 1968, the design had reached the one known today, and has been used continuously from this year, apart from a period in the 1970s when just the letters CAFC appeared on the team&#x27;s shirts.

With the exception of one season, Charlton have always played in red and white – colours chosen by the boys who founded Charlton Athletic in 1905 after having to play their first matches in the borrowed kits of their local rivals Woolwich Arsenal, who also played in red and white. The exception came during part of the 1923–24 season when Charlton wore the colours of Catford Southend as part of the proposed move to Catford, which were light and dark blue stripes. However, after the move fell through, Charlton returned to wearing red and white as their home colours.

The sponsors were as follows:
===Nicknames===

Charlton&#x27;s most common nickname is The Addicks. The origin of this name is from a local fishmonger, Arthur &quot;Ikey&quot; Bryan, who rewarded the team with meals of haddock and chips with vinegar

The progression of the nickname can be seen in the book &quot;The Addicks Cartoons: An Affectionate Look into the Early History of Charlton Athletic&quot;, which covers the pre-First World War history of Charlton through a narrative based on 56 cartoons which appeared in the now defunct Kentish Independent. The very first cartoon, from 31 October 1908, calls the team the Haddocks. By 1910, the name had changed to Addicks although it also appeared as Haddick. The club also have two other nicknames, The Robins, adopted in 1931, and The Valiants, chosen in a fan competition in the 1960s which also led to the adoption of the sword badge which is still in use. The Addicks nickname never went away and was revived by fans after the club lost its Valley home in 1985 and went into exile at Crystal Palace. It is now once again the official nickname of the club.

Charlton fans&#x27; chants have included &quot;Valley, Floyd Road&quot;, a song noting the stadium&#x27;s address to the tune of &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s first ground was Siemens Meadow (1905–1907), a patch of rough ground by the River Thames. This was over-shadowed by the Siemens Brothers Telegraph Works. Then followed Woolwich Common (1907–1908), Pound Park (1908–1913), and Angerstein Lane (1913–1915). After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton&#x27;s new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site. The first match at this site, now known as the club&#x27;s current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to The Mount stadium in Catford as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend. However, after this move collapsed in 1924, Charlton returned to The Valley.

During the 1930s and 1940s, significant improvements were made to the ground, making it one of the largest in the country at that time. In 1938 the highest attendance to date at the ground was recorded at over 75,000 for a FA Cup match against Aston Villa. During the 1940s and 1950s the attendance was often above 40,000, and Charlton had one of the largest support bases in the country. However, after the club&#x27;s relegation little investment was made in The Valley as it fell into decline.

In the 1980s matters came to a head as the ownership of the club and The Valley was divided. The large East Terrace had been closed down by the authorities after the Bradford City stadium fire and the ground&#x27;s owner wanted to use part of the site for housing. In September 1985, Charlton made the controversial move to ground-share with South London neighbours Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. This move was unpopular with supporters and in the late 1980s significant steps were taken to bring about the club&#x27;s return to The Valley.

A single issue political party, the Valley Party, contested the 1990 local Greenwich Borough Council elections on a ticket of reopening the stadium, capturing 11% of the vote, aiding the club&#x27;s return. The Valley Gold investment scheme was created to help supporters fund the return to The Valley, and several players were also sold to raise funds. For the 1991–92 season and part of the 1992–93 season, the Addicks played at West Ham&#x27;s Upton Park as Wimbledon had moved into Selhurst Park alongside Crystal Palace. Charlton finally returned to The Valley in December 1992, celebrating with a 1–0 victory against Portsmouth.

Since the return to The Valley, three sides of the ground have been completely redeveloped turning The Valley into a modern, all-seater stadium with a 27,111 capacity which is the biggest in South London. There are plans in place to increase the ground&#x27;s capacity to approximately 31,000 and even around 40,000 in the future.

==Supporters and rivalries==
The bulk of the club&#x27;s support base comes from South East London and Kent, particularly the London boroughs of Greenwich, Bexley and Bromley. Supporters played a key role in the return of the club to The Valley in 1992 and were rewarded by being granted a voice on the board in the form of an elected supporter director. Any season ticket holder could put themselves forward for election, with a certain number of nominations, and votes were cast by all season ticket holders over the age of 18. The last such director, Ben Hayes, was elected in 2006 to serve until 2008, when the role was discontinued as a result of legal issues. Its functions were replaced by a fans forum, which met for the first time in December 2008 and is still active to this day.

Charlton&#x27;s main rivals are their South London neighbours, Crystal Palace and Millwall. Unlike those rivals Charlton have never competed in football&#x27;s fourth tier and are the only one of the three to have won the FA Cup.

In 1985, Charlton were forced to ground-share with Crystal Palace after safety concerns at The Valley. They played their home fixtures at the Glaziers&#x27; Selhurst Park stadium until 1991. The arrangement was seen by Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades as essential for the future of football, but it was unpopular with both sets of fans. Charlton fans campaigned for a return to The Valley throughout their time at Selhurst Park. In 2005, Palace were relegated by Charlton at the Valley after a 2–2 draw. Palace needed a win to survive. However, with seven minutes left, Charlton equalised, relegating their rivals. Post-match, there was a well-publicised altercation between the two chairmen of the respective clubs, Richard Murray and Simon Jordan. Since their first meeting in the Football League in 1925, Charlton have won 17, drawn 13 and lost 26 games against Palace. The teams last met in 2015, a 4–1 win for Palace in the League Cup.

Charlton are closest in proximity to Millwall than any other EFL club, with The Valley and The Den being less than four miles () apart. They last met in July 2020, a 1–0 win for Millwall at the Valley. Since their first Football League game in 1921, Charlton have won 11, drawn 26 and lost 37 league games (the two sides also met twice in the Anglo-Italian Cup in the 1992–93 season; Charlton winning one tie, and one draw). The Addicks have not beaten Millwall in the last 12 league fixtures between the sides; their last win came on 9 March 1996 at The Valley.

==In popular culture==
===Film and TV===
Charlton Athletic featured in the ITV one-off drama &quot;Albert&#x27;s Memorial&quot;, shown on 12 September 2010 and starring David Jason and David Warner.

In the long-running BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, Rodney Charlton Trotter is named after the club.

In the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion Ace (played by Sophie Aldred from 1987 to 1989) wears a Charlton Athletic badge on her black bomber jacket and the club is mentioned in &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;.

The Valley and manager Alan Curbishley made cameo appearances in the Sky One television series &quot;Dream Team&quot;.

Charlton Athletic assumes a pivotal role in the film &quot;The Silent Playground&quot; (1963). Three children get in to trouble when their mother&#x27;s boyfriend &#x27;Uncle&#x27; Alan (John Ronane), gives them pocket money to wander off on their own, so that he can attend a Charlton football match. There is some footage from the ground which Ronane is later seen leaving.

A Charlton Athletic match against Manchester United in the 1950s is depicted in BBC Two television film &quot;United&quot; (released in 2011).

A young Billy Butcher has a Charlton flag in his room in Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Boys&quot;.

===Books===
Charlton Athletic has also featured in several book publications, in both fiction and factual/sports writing. These include works by Charlie Connelly and Paul Breen&#x27;s work of popular fiction which is entitled &quot;The Charlton Men&quot;. The book is set against Charlton&#x27;s successful 2011–12 season when they won the League One title and promotion back to the Championship in concurrence with the 2011 London riots.

Timothy Young, the protagonist in &quot;Out of the Shelter&quot;, a 1970 novel by David Lodge, supports Charlton Athletic. The book describes Timothy listening to Charlton&#x27;s victory in the 1947 FA Cup Final on the radio.

<text>Cross-country skiing is a form of skiing whereby skiers traverse snow-covered terrain without use of ski lifts or other assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of travel. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.

Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Europe, Canada, Russia, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

Competitive cross-country skiing is one of the Nordic skiing sports. Cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon. Ski orienteering is a form of cross-country skiing, which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.

==History==
The word ski comes from the Old Norse word which means stick of wood. Skiing started as a technique for traveling cross-country over snow on skis, starting almost five millennia ago with beginnings in Scandinavia. It may have been practised as early as 600 BCE in Daxing&#x27;anling, in what is now China. Early historical evidence includes Procopius&#x27;s (around CE 550) description of Sami people as &quot;skrithiphinoi&quot; translated as &quot;ski running samis&quot;. Birkely argues that the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years, evidenced by the very old Sami word &quot;čuoigat&quot; for skiing. Egil Skallagrimsson&#x27;s 950 CE saga describes King Haakon the Good&#x27;s practice of sending his tax collectors out on skis. The Gulating law (1274) stated that &quot;No moose shall be disturbed by skiers on private land.&quot; Cross-country skiing evolved from a utilitarian means of transportation to being a worldwide recreational activity and sport, which branched out into other forms of skiing starting in the mid-1800s.

Early skiers used one long pole or spear in addition to the skis. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741. Traditional skis, used for snow travel in Norway and elsewhere into the 1800s, often comprised one short ski with a natural fur traction surface, the &quot;andor&quot;, and one long for gliding, the &quot;langski&quot;—one being up to longer than the other—allowing skiers to propel themselves with a scooter motion. This combination has a long history among the Sami people. Skis up to 280 cm have been produced in Finland, and the longest recorded ski in Norway is 373 cm.

===Transportation===

Ski warfare, the use of ski-equipped troops in war, is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. These troops were reportedly able to cover distances comparable to that of light cavalry. The garrison in Trondheim used skis at least from 1675, and the Danish-Norwegian army included specialized skiing battalions from 1747—details of military ski exercises from 1767 are on record. Skis were used in military exercises in 1747. In 1799 French traveller Jacques de la Tocnaye recorded his visit to Norway in his travel diary: Norwegian immigrants used skis (&quot;Norwegian snowshoes&quot;) in the US midwest from around 1836. Norwegian immigrant &quot;Snowshoe Thompson&quot; transported mail by skiing across the Sierra Nevada between California and Nevada from 1856. In 1888 Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his team crossed the Greenland icecap on skis. Norwegian workers on the Buenos Aires - Valparaiso railway line introduced skiing in South America around 1890. In 1910 Roald Amundsen used skis on his South Pole Expedition. In 1902 the Norwegian consul in Kobe imported ski equipment and introduced skiing to the Japanese, motivated by the death of Japanese soldiers during a snow storm. Starting in 1919, Vladimir Lenin helped popularize the activity in the Soviet Union.

===Sport===
Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at a target while skiing at &quot;top speed&quot;, downhill racing among trees, downhill racing on large slopes without falling, and &quot;long racing&quot; on &quot;flat ground&quot;. An early record of a public ski competition occurred in Tromsø, 1843. In Norwegian, refers to &quot;competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in groomed tracks in the shortest possible time&quot;. In Norway, &quot;ski touring competitions&quot; () are long-distance cross-country competitions open to the public, competition is usually within age intervals.

A new technique, skate skiing, was experimented with early in the 20th Century, but was not widely adopted until the 1980s. Johan Grøttumsbråten used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof, one of the earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross-country skiing. This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces. It became widespread during the 1980s after the success of Bill Koch (United States) in 1982 Cross-country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the skating style. Norwegian skier Ove Aunli started using the technique in 1984, when he found it to be much faster than classic style. Finnish skier, Pauli Siitonen, developed a one-sided variant of the style in the 1970s, leaving one ski in the track while skating to the side with the other one during endurance events; this became known as the &quot;marathon skate&quot;.

===Terminology===

The word &quot;ski&quot; comes from the Old Norse word which means &quot;cleft wood&quot;, &quot;stick of wood&quot; or &quot;ski&quot;. Norwegian language does not use a verb-form equivalent in idiomatic speech, unlike English &quot;to ski&quot;. In modern Norwegian, a variety of terms refer to cross-country skiing, including:

* (literally &quot;walk on skis&quot;)—a general term for self-propelled skiing
* (literally &quot;hiking on skis&quot;)—refers to ski touring as recreation
* (literally &quot;long race&quot;)—refers to cross-country ski racing

In contrast, alpine skiing is referred to as (literally &quot;stand on skis&quot;).

Fridtjof Nansen, describes the crossing of Greenland as , literally &quot;On skis across Greenland&quot;, while the English edition of the report was titled, &quot;The first crossing of Greenland&quot;. Nansen referred to the activity of traversing snow on skis as (he used the term also in the English translation), which may be translated as &quot;ski running&quot;. Nansen used , regarding all forms of skiing, but noted that ski jumping is purely a competitive sport and not for amateurs. He further noted that in some competitions the skier &quot;is also required to show his skill in turning his ski to one side or the other within given marks&quot; at full speed on a steep hill. Nansen regarded these forms (i.e., jumping and slalom) as &quot;special arts&quot;, and believed that the most important branch of skiing was travel &quot;in an ordinary way across the country&quot;. In Germany, Nansen&#x27;s Greenland report was published as (literally &quot;On snowshoes through Greenland&quot;). The German term, , was supplanted by the borrowed Norwegian word, , in the late 19th century. The Norwegian encyclopedia of sports also uses the term, , (literally &quot;ski running&quot;) for all forms of skiing. Around 1900 the word was used in German in the same sense as .

==Recreation==

Recreational cross-country skiing includes ski touring and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands. It is an accessible form of recreation for persons with vision and mobility impairments. A related form of recreation is dog skijoring—a winter sport where a cross-country skier is assisted by one or more dogs.

===Ski touring===
Ski touring takes place off-piste and outside of ski resorts. Tours may extend over multiple days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring&#x27;s subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis can also be used to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.

===Groomed-trail skiing===
Groomed trail skiing occurs at facilities such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park in Quebec, where trails are laid out and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such grooming and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to the condition of the snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines which tow snow-compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation, or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors.
Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called &quot;lysløype&quot; (light trails) in Norwegian and &quot;elljusspår&quot; (electric-light trails) in Swedish. The first &quot;lysløype&quot; opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).

==Competition==

Cross-country ski competition encompasses a variety of formats for races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) and by national organizations, such as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association and Cross Country Ski Canada. It also encompasses cross-country ski marathon events, sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation, cross-country ski orienteering events, sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation, and Paralympic cross-country skiing, sanctioned by the International Paralympic Committee.

===FIS-sanctioned competition===

The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympic Games. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. Notable cross-country ski competitions include the Winter Olympics, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, and the FIS World Cup events (including the Holmenkollen).

===Other sanctioned competition===
Cross-country ski marathons—races with distances greater than 40 kilometers—have two cup series, the Ski Classics, which started in 2011, and the Worldloppet. Skiers race in classic or free-style (skating) events, depending on the rules of the race. Notable ski marathons, include the &quot;Vasaloppet&quot; in Sweden, &quot;Birkebeineren&quot; in Norway, the Tartu Maraton in Estonia, the Engadin Skimarathon in Switzerland, the American Birkebeiner, the Tour of Anchorage in Anchorage, Alaska, and the Boreal Loppet, held in Forestville, Quebec, Canada.

Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant&#x27;s total running distance/time. For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; the skier receives a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules.

Ski orienteering is a form of cross-country skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.

Paralympic cross-country ski competition is an adaptation of cross-country skiing for athletes with disabilities. Paralympic cross-country skiing includes standing events, sitting events (for wheelchair users), and events for visually impaired athletes under the rules of the International Paralympic Committee. These are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs, have amputations, are blind, or have any other physical disability, to continue their sport.

==Techniques==
Cross-country skiing has two basic propulsion techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique relies on a wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle from each other in a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.

Poles contribute to forward propulsion, either simultaneously (usual for the skate technique) or in alternating sequence (common for the classical technique as the &quot;diagonal stride&quot;). Double poling is also used with the classical technique when higher speed can be achieved on flats and slight downhills than is available in the diagonal stride, which is favored to achieve higher power going uphill.

===Classic===
The classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the &quot;diagonal stride&quot; variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward-striding foot; with the &quot;kick-double-pole&quot; variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion. On uphill terrain, techniques include the &quot;side step&quot; for steep slopes, moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line, the &quot;herringbone&quot; for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.

===Skate skiing===

With skate skiing, the skier provides propulsion on a smooth, firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle, in a manner similar to ice skating. Skate-skiing usually involves a coordinated use of poles and the upper body to add impetus. Three common techniques are &quot;V1&quot;, &quot;V2&quot; and &quot;V2 alternate&quot;. In &quot;V1&quot; the skier pushes with a double pole plant each time the ski is extended on a temporarily &quot;dominant&quot; side, this technique is optimal for climbing. In &quot;V2 alternate&quot; the skier performs the double pole plant before the &quot;dominant&quot; ski is extended, this technique allows for maintaining a higher speed and is often used on slightly downhill terrain. In &quot;V2&quot; the skier performs the double pole plant each time the ski is extended on either side, on flat ground and in slight inclines this technique is often the fastest and most efficient of the 3. Skiers climb hills with these techniques by widening the angle of the &quot;V&quot; and by making more frequent, shorter strides and more forceful use of poles. A variant of the technique is the &quot;marathon skate&quot; or &quot;Siitonen step&quot;, where the skier leaves one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski.

===Turns===
Turns, used while descending or for braking, include the snowplough (or &quot;wedge turn&quot;), the stem christie (or &quot;wedge christie&quot;), parallel turn, and the Telemark turn. The step turn is used for maintaining speed during descents or out of track on flats.

==Equipment==

Equipment comprises skis, poles, boots and bindings; these vary according to:
* Technique, classic vs skate
* Terrain, which may vary from groomed trails to wilderness

Skis used in cross-country are lighter and narrower than those used in alpine skiing. Ski bottoms are designed to provide a gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.

====Types====
Each type of ski is sized and designed differently. Length affects maneuverability; camber affects pressure on the snow beneath the feet of the skier; side-cut affects the ease of turning; width affects forward friction; overall area on the snow affects bearing capacity; and tip geometry affects the ability to penetrate new snow or to stay in a track. Each of the following ski types has a different combination of these attributes:
* Classic skis: Designed for skiing in tracks. For adult skiers (between 155 cm/50 kg and 185 cm/75 kg), recommended lengths are between 180 and 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier&#x27;s height). Traction comes from a &quot;grip zone&quot; underfoot that when bearing the skier&#x27;s weight engages either a textured gripping surface or a grip wax. Accordingly, these skis are classified as &quot;waxable&quot; or &quot;waxless&quot;. Recreational waxless skis generally require little attention and are adapted for casual use. Waxable skis, if prepared correctly, provide better grip and glide.

:When the skier&#x27;s weight is distributed on both skis, the ski&#x27;s diminishes the pressure of the grip zone on the snow and promotes bearing on the remaining area of the ski—the &quot;glide zone&quot;. A test for stiffness of camber is made with a piece of paper under the skier&#x27;s foot, standing on skis on a flat, hard surface—the paper should be pinned throughout the grip zone of the ski on which all the skier&#x27;s weight is placed, but slide freely when the skier&#x27;s weight is bearing equally on both skis.
* Skate skis: Designed for skiing on groomed surfaces. The usual recommended length is skier length +5-15cm. The entire bottom of each skate ski is a glide zone—prepared for maximum glide. Traction comes from the skier pushing away from the edge of the previous ski onto the next ski.
* Back country skis: Designed for ski touring on natural snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, depending on height and weight of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.

:The geometry of a back country ski depends on its purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.

====Gliding surface====

Glide waxes enhance the speed of the gliding surface. The wax is either melted on the base using an iron or applied in a liquid form. The excess wax is first scraped off and then finished by brushing. Most glide waxes are based on paraffin that is combined with additive materials. The paraffin hardness and additives are varied based on snow type, humidity and temperature. Since the 2021-2022 race season, fluorinated products are banned in FIS sanctioned competitions. Before the ban, most race waxes combined fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes with fluorocarbon overlays. Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski.

====Traction surface====

Skis designed for classic technique, both in track and in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the &quot;grip zone&quot; or &quot;kick zone&quot;, underfoot. This comes either from a) &quot;texture&quot;, such as &quot;fish scales&quot; or mohair skins, designed to slide forward but not backwards, that is built into the grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from &quot;grip waxes&quot;. Grip waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions). Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction. Hard grip waxes do not work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called &quot;klister&quot;.

===Boots and bindings===

Ski boots are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).

Bindings connect the boot to the ski. There are three primary groups of binding systems used in cross-country skiing (in descending order of importance):
* Standardized system: Boots and bindings have an integrated connection, typically a bar across the front end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.
* Three-pin: The boot-gripping system comprises three pins that correspond to three holes in the sole of the boot&#x27;s toe, used primarily for back-country skiing.
* Cable: A cable secures the free-moving heel and keeps the toe of the boot pushed into a boot-gripping section, used primarily for back-country and telemark skiing.

===Poles===

Ski poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from aluminium, fibreglass-reinforced plastic, or carbon fibre, depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of wood or bamboo. They feature a foot (called a basket) near the end of the shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing. Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill. The single pole was longer and stronger than the poles that are used in pairs. In competitive cross-country poles in pairs were introduced around 1900.

<text>Copacabana ( , , ) is a (neighbourhood) located in the South Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is most prominently known for its 4 km (2.5 miles) balneario beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.

== History ==
The district was originally called (translated from the Tupi language, it means &quot;the way of the &quot;, the being a kind of bird) until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the Virgen de Copacabana, the patron saint of Bolivia.

== Characteristics ==
Copacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside Fort Copacabana and the other, right after it: Diabo (&quot;Devil&quot;) Beach. Arpoador beach, where surfers go after its perfect waves, comes next, followed by the famous borough of Ipanema. The area served as one of the four &quot;Olympic Zones&quot; during the 2016 Summer Olympics. According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.

== Copacabana Beach ==
Copacabana beach, located at the Atlantic shore, stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Leme is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; Fort Copacabana, built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. Many hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and residential buildings are located in the area. On Sundays and holidays, one side of Avenida Atlântica is closed to cars, giving residents and tourists more space for activities along the beach.

Copacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, and for the first three editions of the tournament, has been the official venue of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. 
==Copacabana promenade==
The Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was rebuilt in 1970 and has used a black and white Portuguese pavement design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by Roberto Burle Marx.

==Living standard==
Copacabana has the 12th highest Human Development Index in Rio; the 2000 census put the HDI of Copacabana at 0.902.

==Neighbourhood==
According to the IBGE, 160,000 people live in Copacabana and 44,000 or 27.5% of them are 60 years old or older. Copacabana covers an area of 5.220 km which gives the borough a population density of 20,400 people per km. Residential buildings eleven to thirteen stories high built next to each other dominate the borough. Houses and two-story buildings are rare.

When Rio was the capital of Brazil, Copacabana was considered one of the best neighborhoods in the country.

==Transportation==
More than 40 different bus routes serve Copacabana, as do three subway Metro stations: Cantagalo, Siqueira Campos and Cardeal Arcoverde.

Three major arteries parallel to each other cut across the entire borough: Avenida Atlântica (Atlantic Avenue), which is a 6-lane, 4 km avenue by the beachside, Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue and Barata Ribeiro/Raul Pompéia Street both of which are 4 lanes and 3.5 km in length. Barata Ribeiro Street changes its name to Raul Pompéia Street after the Sá Freire Alvim Tunnel. Twenty-four streets intersect all three major arteries, and seven other streets intersect some of the three.

==New Year&#x27;s Eve in Copacabana==
The fireworks display in Rio de Janeiro to celebrate New Year&#x27;s Eve is one of the largest in the world, lasting 15 to 20 minutes. It is estimated that 2 million people go to Copacabana Beach to see the spectacle. The festival also includes a concert that extends throughout the night. The celebration has become one of the biggest tourist attractions of Rio de Janeiro, attracting visitors from all over Brazil as well as from different parts of the world, and the city hotels generally stay fully booked. The celebration is broadcast live on major Brazilian radio and television networks, including TV Globo.

===History===
New Year&#x27;s Eve has been celebrated on Copacabana beach since the 1950s when cults of African origin such as Candomblé and Umbanda gathered in small groups dressed in white for ritual celebrations. The first fireworks display occurred in 1976, sponsored by a hotel on the waterfront and this has been repeated ever since. In the 1990s the city saw it as a great opportunity to promote the city and organized and expanded the event.

An assessment made during the New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992 highlighted the risks associated with increasing crowd numbers on Copacabana beach after the fireworks display. Since the 1993-94 event concerts have been held on the beach to retain the public. The result was a success with egress spaced out over a period of 2 hours without the previous turmoil, although critics claimed that it denied the spirit of the New Year&#x27;s tradition of a religious festival with fireworks by the sea. The following year Rod Stewart beat attendance records. Finally, the Tribute to Tom Jobim - with Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, and Paulinho da Viola - consolidated the shows at the Copacabana Réveillon.

There was a need to transform the fireworks display in a show of the same quality. The fireworks display was created by entrepreneurs Ricardo Amaral and Marius. From the previous 8–10 minutes the time was extended to 20 minutes and the quality and diversity of the fireworks was improved. A technical problem in fireworks 2000 required the use of ferries from New Year&#x27;s Eve 2001–02. New Year&#x27;s Eve has begun to compete with the Carnival, and since 1992 it has been a tourist attraction in its own right.

There was no celebration in 2020–21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the fireworks show went on.

<doc id="6725" wikidata="Q634857" url="?curid=6725" title="Cy Young Award">
<text>The Cy Young Award is given annually to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB), one each for the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The award was introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford C. Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.

Each league&#x27;s award is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Local BBWAA chapter chairmen in each MLB city recommend two writers to vote for each award. Final approval comes from the BBWAA national secretrary-treasurer. Writers vote for either the American League or National League awards, depending on the league in which their local team plays. A total of 30 writers vote for each league&#x27;s awards. Writers cast their votes prior to the start of postseason play.

As of the 2010 season, each voter places a vote for first, second, third, fourth, and fifth place among the pitchers of each league. The formula used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes. The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award. If two pitchers receive the same number of votes, the award is shared. From 1970 to 2009, writers voted for three pitchers, with the formula of five points for a first-place vote, three for a second-place vote and one for a third-place vote. Before 1970, writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote.

==History==
The Cy Young Award was introduced in 1956 by Commissioner of Baseball Ford C. Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. Originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, the award changed its format over time. From 1956 to 1966, the award was given to one pitcher in Major League Baseball. After Frick retired in 1967, William Eckert became the new Commissioner of Baseball. Due to fan requests, Eckert announced that the Cy Young Award would be given out both in the American League and the National League. From 1956 to 1958, a pitcher was not allowed to win the award on more than one occasion; this rule was eliminated in 1959. After a tie in the 1969 voting for the Cy Young Award, the process was changed, in which each writer was to vote for three pitchers: the first-place vote received five points, the second-place vote received three points, and the third-place vote received one point.

The first recipient of the Cy Young Award was Don Newcombe of the Dodgers. The Dodgers are the franchise with the most Cy Young Awards. In 1957, Warren Spahn became the first left-handed pitcher to win the award. In 1963, Sandy Koufax became the first pitcher to win the award in a unanimous vote; two years later he became the first multiple winner. In 1978, Gaylord Perry (age 40) became the oldest pitcher to receive the award, a record that stood until broken in 2004 by Roger Clemens (age 42). The youngest recipient was Dwight Gooden (age 20 in 1985). In 2012, R. A. Dickey became the first knuckleball pitcher to win the award.

In 1974, Mike Marshall became the first relief pitcher to win the award. In 1992, Dennis Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth-inning situations) to win the award, and since then only one other relief pitcher has won the award, Éric Gagné in 2003 (also a closer). A total of nine relief pitchers have won the Cy Young Award across both leagues.

Steve Carlton in 1982 became the first pitcher to win more than three Cy Young Awards, while Greg Maddux in 1994 became the first to win at least three in a row (and received a fourth straight the following year), a feat later repeated by Randy Johnson.

==Winners==

===Major Leagues combined (1956–1966)===

===American League (1967–present)===

===National League (1967–present)===

===Multiple winners===
Twenty-two (22) pitchers have won the award multiple times. Roger Clemens currently holds the record for the most awards won, with seven – his first and last wins separated by eighteen years. Greg Maddux (1992–1995) and Randy Johnson (1999–2002) share the record for the most consecutive awards won with four. Clemens, Johnson, Pedro Martínez, Gaylord Perry, Roy Halladay, Max Scherzer, and Blake Snell are the only pitchers to have won the award in both the American League and National League; Sandy Koufax is the only pitcher who won multiple awards during the period when only one award was presented for all of Major League Baseball. Roger Clemens was the youngest pitcher to win a second Cy Young Award, while Tim Lincecum is the youngest pitcher to do so in the National League, and Clayton Kershaw is the youngest left-hander to do so. Clayton Kershaw is the youngest pitcher to win a third Cy Young Award. Clemens is also the only pitcher to win the Cy Young Award with four different teams; nobody else has done so with more than two different teams. Justin Verlander has the most seasons separating his first (2011) and second (2019) Cy Young Awards.

<doc id="6728" wikidata="Q2526690" url="?curid=6728" title="Antisemitism in Christianity">
<text>Some Christian Churches, Christian groups, and ordinary Christians express antisemitism toward the Jewish people and the associated religion of Judaism. These can be thought of as examples of &quot;anti-Semitism expressed by Christians&quot; or by Christian communities. However, the term &quot;Christian Anti-Semitism&quot; has also been used to refer to anti-Jewish sentiments that arise out of Christian doctrinal or theological stances (by thinkers such as Jules Isaac, for example, especially in his book &quot;Jésus et Israël&quot;). The term &quot;Christian Anti-Semitism&quot; is also used to suggest that to some degree, contempt for Jews and Judaism inhere to Christianity as a religion, itself and that centralized institutions of Christian power (such as The Catholic Church or The Church of England), as well as governments with strong Christian influence (such as the Catholic Monarchs of Spain) have generated societal structures that survive to this day which perpetuate anti-Semitism. This usage appears particularly in discussions of Christian structures of power within society, which are referred to as Christian Hegemony or Christian Privilege; these are part of larger discussions of Structural inequality and power dynamics. 

Anti-Semitic Christian rhetoric and the resulting antipathy toward Jews both date back to the early years of Christianity and resemble pagan anti-Jewish attitudes that were reinforced by the belief that Jews are responsible for the murder of Jesus of Nazareth. Christians imposed ever-increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries, including acts of ostracism, humiliation, expropriation, violence, and murder—measures which culminated in the Holocaust.

Christian antisemitism has been attributed to numerous factors including theological differences between these two related Abrahamic religions; the competition between Church and synagogue; the Christian missionary impulse; a misunderstanding of Jewish culture, beliefs, and practice; and the perception that Judaism was hostile toward Christianity. For two millennia, these attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art, and popular teachings, as well as statutes designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews.

Modern anti-Semitism has primarily been described as hatred against Jews as a race and its most recent expression is rooted in 18th-century racial theories. Anti-Judaism is rooted in hostility toward Judaism the religion; in Western Christianity, anti-Judaism effectively merged with anti-Semitism during the 12th century. Scholars have debated how Christian anti-Semitism played a role in the Nazi Third Reich, World War II, and the Holocaust. The Holocaust forced many Christians to reflect on the role(s) Christian theology and practice played and still play in anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism.

==Early differences between Christianity and Judaism==

The legal status of Christianity and Judaism differed within the Roman Empire: because the practice of Judaism was restricted to the Jewish people and Jewish proselytes, its followers were generally exempt from following the obligations that were imposed on followers of other religions by the Roman imperial cult. Since the reign of Julius Caesar, Judaism enjoyed the status of a &quot;licit religion&quot;, but occasional persecutions still occurred, such as Tiberius&#x27; conscription and expulsion of Jews in 19 AD followed by Claudius&#x27; expulsion of Jews from Rome. Christianity however was not restricted to one people, and because Jewish Christians were excluded from the synagogue (see Council of Jamnia), they also lost the protected status that was granted to Judaism, even though that protection still had its limits (see Titus Flavius Clemens (consul), Rabbi Akiva, and Ten Martyrs).

From the reign of Nero onwards, who is said by Tacitus to have blamed the Great Fire of Rome on Christians, the practice of Christianity was criminalized and Christians were frequently persecuted, but the persecution differed from region to region. Comparably, Judaism suffered setbacks due to the Jewish–Roman wars, and these setbacks are remembered in the legacy of the Ten Martyrs. Robin Lane Fox traces the origin of much of the later hostility to this early period of persecution, when the Roman authorities commonly tested the faith of suspected Christians by forcing them to pay homage to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the , and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origin) would say that they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as fellow Jews, often leading to their execution. The was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until Constantine&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. In 390 Theodosius I made Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire. While pagan cults and Manichaeism were suppressed, Judaism retained its legal status as a licit religion, though anti-Jewish violence still occurred. In the 5th century, some legal measures worsened the status of the Jews in the Roman Empire.

==Issues arising from the New Testament==
===Jesus as the Messiah===

In Judaism, Jesus was not recognized as the Messiah, which Christians interpreted as his rejection, as a failed Jewish Messiah claimant and a false prophet. Since Jews traditionally believe that the messiah has not yet come and the Messianic Age is not yet present, the total rejection of Jesus as either the messiah or a deity has never been a central issue in Judaism. However, it is interesting to note that the first &#x27;Christian&#x27; church in Jerusalem was almost exclusively Jewish in its congregational makeup, with this early Christian church (through the years 40–60 AD) being made up of approximately 1,000 Jews who had decided to believe in and worship Jesus.

===Criticism of the Pharisees===

Many New Testament passages criticise the Pharisees, a Jewish social movement and school of thought during the Second Temple period (516 BCE–70 CE), and it has been argued that these passages have shaped the way that Christians viewed Jews. Like most Bible passages, however, they can be and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.

Mainstream Talmudic Rabbinical Judaism today directly descends from the Pharisaical tradition, which Jesus often criticized. During Jesus&#x27; life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the Sadducees, Zealots, and Essenes who mostly died out not long after the period; Jewish scholars such as Harvey Falk and Hyam Maccoby have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. In the Sermon on the Mount, for example, Jesus says &quot;The Pharisees sit in Moses&#x27; seat, therefore do what they say&quot;. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against certain groups of Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time (see for example Hillel and Shammai).

===Recent studies of anti-Semitism in the New Testament===
Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of &quot;Antisemitism in the New Testament&quot; (University Press of America, 1994) has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are anti-Semitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is John Dominic Crossan&#x27;s 1995 book, titled &quot;Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus&quot;.

Some biblical scholars have also been accused of holding anti-Semitic beliefs. Bruce J. Malina, a founding member of The Context Group, has come under criticism for going as far as to deny the Semitic ancestry of modern Israelis. He then ties this back to his work on first-century cultural anthropology.

=== Jewish deicide ===

Jewish deicide is the belief that Jews to this day will always be collectively responsible for the killing of Jesus, also known as the blood curse. A justification of this charge is derived from the Gospel of Matthew (27:24–25), alleging a crowd of Jews told Pilate that they and their children would be responsible for Jesus&#x27; death. Most members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accept the Jewish deicide, while the Catholic Church and several other Christian denominations have repudiated it.

==Church Fathers==


After Paul&#x27;s death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and Pauline Christianity emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements. Some Christians continued to adhere to aspects of Jewish law, but they were few and often considered heretics by the Church. One example is the Ebionites, who seemed to have denied the virgin birth of Jesus, the physical Resurrection of Jesus, and most of the books that were later canonized as the New Testament. For example, the Ethiopian Orthodox continue Old Testament practices such as the Sabbath. As late as the 4th century Church Father John Chrysostom complained that some Christians were still attending Jewish synagogues. The Church Fathers identified Jews and Judaism with heresy and declared the people of Israel to be (&#x27;outside of God&#x27;).

===Peter of Antioch===
Peter of Antioch referred to Christians that refused to venerate religious images as having &quot;Jewish minds&quot;.

===Marcion of Sinope===
In the early second century AD, the heretic Marcion of Sinope () declared that the Jewish God was a different God, inferior to the Christian one, and rejected the Jewish scriptures as the product of a lesser deity. Marcion&#x27;s teachings, which were extremely popular, rejected Judaism not only as an incomplete revelation, but as a false one as well, but, at the same time, allowed less blame to be placed on the Jews personally for having not recognized Jesus, since, in Marcion&#x27;s worldview, Jesus was not sent by the lesser Jewish God, but by the supreme Christian God, whom the Jews had no reason to recognize.

In combating Marcion, orthodox apologists conceded that Judaism was an incomplete and inferior religion to Christianity, while also defending the Jewish scriptures as canonical.

===Tertullian===
The Church Father Tertullian () had a particularly intense personal dislike towards the Jews and argued that the Gentiles had been chosen by God to replace the Jews because they were worthier and more honorable. Origen of Alexandria () was more knowledgeable about Judaism than any of the other Church Fathers, having studied Hebrew, met Rabbi Hillel the Younger, consulted and debated with Jewish scholars, and been influenced by the allegorical interpretations of Philo of Alexandria. Origen defended the canonicity of the Hebrew Bible and defended Jews of the past as having been chosen by God for their merits. Nonetheless, he condemned contemporary Jews for not understanding their own Law, insisted that Christians were the &quot;true Israel&quot;, and blamed the Jews for the death of Christ. He did, however, maintain that Jews would eventually attain salvation in the final &quot;apocatastasis&quot;. Hippolytus of Rome () wrote that the Jews had &quot;been darkened in the eyes of your soul with a darkness utter and everlasting.&quot;

===Augustine of Hippo===
Patristic bishops of the patristic era such as Augustine of Hippo argued that the Jews should be left alive and suffering as a perpetual reminder of their murder of Christ. Like his anti-Jewish teacher, Ambrose of Milan, he defined Jews as a special subset of those damned to hell. As &quot;Witness People&quot;, he sanctified collective punishment for the Jewish deicide and enslavement of Jews to Catholics: &quot;Not by bodily death, shall the ungodly race of carnal Jews perish[...] &#x27;Scatter them abroad, take away their strength. And bring them down O Lord. Augustine claimed to &quot;love&quot; the Jews but as a means to convert them to Christianity. Sometimes he identified all Jews with the evil of Judas Iscariot and developed the doctrine (together with Cyprian) that there was &quot;no salvation outside the Church&quot;.

===John Chrysostom===
John Chrysostom and other church fathers went further in their condemnation; the Catholic editor Paul Harkins wrote that St. John Chrysostom&#x27;s anti-Jewish theology &quot;is no longer tenable[...] For these objectively unchristian acts, he cannot be excused, even if he is the product of his times.&quot; John Chrysostom held, as most Church Fathers did, that the sins of all Jews were communal and endless; to Chrysostom, his Jewish neighbors were the collective representation of all alleged crimes of all preexisting Jews. All Church Fathers applied the passages of the New Testament concerning the alleged advocation of the crucifixion of Christ to all Jews of their day, holding that the Jews were the ultimate evil. However, Chrysostom went so far as to say that because Jews rejected the Christian God in human flesh, Christ, they therefore deserved to be killed: &quot;grew fit for slaughter.&quot; In citing the New Testament, he claimed that Jesus was speaking about Jews when he said, &quot;as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.&quot;

===Jerome===
St. Jerome identified Jews with Judas Iscariot and the immoral use of money (&quot;Judas is cursed, that in Judas the Jews may be accursed[...] their prayers turn into sins&quot;). Jerome&#x27;s homiletical assaults, which may have served as the basis for the anti-Jewish Good Friday liturgy, contrasts Jews with the evil, and that &quot;the ceremonies of the Jews are harmful and deadly to Christians&quot;, whoever keeps them was doomed to the devil: &quot;My enemies are the Jews; they have conspired in hatred against Me, crucified Me, heaped evils of all kinds upon Me, blasphemed Me.&quot;

===Ephraim the Syrian===
Ephraim the Syrian wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.

==Middle Ages==
Bernard of Clairvaux said &quot;For us the Jews are Scripture&#x27;s living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered. They are not to be persecuted, killed, or even put to flight.&quot; According to Anna Sapir Abulafia, most scholars agree that Jews and Christians in Latin Christendom lived in relative peace with one another until the 13th century.

Jews were subjected to a wide range of legal disabilities and restrictions in medieval Europe. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. Jews&#x27; association to money lending would carry on throughout history in the stereotype of Jews being greedy and perpetuating capitalism.

In the later medieval period, the number of Jews who were permitted to reside in certain places was limited; they were concentrated in ghettos, and they were also not allowed to own land; they were forced to pay discriminatory taxes whenever they entered cities or districts other than their own. The Oath More Judaico, the form of oath required from Jewish witnesses, developed bizarre or humiliating forms in some places, e.g. in the Swabian law of the 13th century, the Jew would be required to stand on the hide of a sow or a bloody lamb.

The Fourth Lateran Council which was held in 1215 was the first council to proclaim that Jews were required to wear something that distinguished them as Jews (the same requirement was also imposed on Muslims). On many occasions, Jews were accused of blood libels, the supposed drinking of the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist.
 (the &quot;Constitution for the Jews&quot;) was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first papal bull was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who suffered during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century although they were not always strictly upheld.

The bull forbade, besides other things, Christians from coercing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication:

===Popular anti-Semitism===

Anti-Semitism in popular European Christian culture escalated beginning in the 13th century. Blood libels and host desecration drew popular attention and led to many cases of persecution against Jews. Many believed Jews poisoned wells to cause plagues. In the case of blood libel, it was widely believed that the Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo. Throughout history, if a Christian child was murdered accusations of blood libel would arise no matter how small the Jewish population. The Church often added to the fire by portraying the dead child as a martyr who had been tortured, and who had powers like Jesus was believed to. Sometimes the children were even made into saints. Anti-Semitic imagery such as Judensau and Ecclesia et Synagoga recurred in Christian art and architecture. Anti-Jewish Easter holiday customs such as the Burning of Judas continue to the present time.

In Iceland, one of the hymns repeated in the days leading up to Easter includes the lines:

===Persecutions and expulsions===

During the Middle Ages in Europe persecutions and formal expulsions of Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although this was also the case for other minority communities, regardless of whether they were religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution during the Rhineland massacres of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they traveled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. In Germany, the Holy Roman Emperor generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but was often unable to exert much influence. In the Edict of Expulsion, King Edward I expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 (only after ransoming some 3,000 among the most wealthy of them), on the accusation of usury and undermining loyalty to the dynasty. In 1306 there was a wave of persecution in France, and there were widespread Black Death Jewish persecutions as the Jews were blamed by many Christians for the plague, or for spreading it. As late as 1519, the Imperial city of Regensburg took advantage of the recent death of Emperor Maximilian I to expel its 500 Jews.

&quot;Officially, the medieval Catholic church never advocated the expulsion of all the Jews from Christendom or repudiated Augustine&#x27;s doctrine of Jewish witness... Still, late medieval Christendom frequently ignored its mandates&quot;.

====Expulsion of Jews from Spain====
The largest expulsion of Jews followed the Reconquista or the reunification of Spain, and it preceded the expulsion of the Muslims who would not convert, despite the protection of their religious rights promised by the Treaty of Granada (1491). On 31 March 1492 Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, the rulers of Spain who financed Christopher Columbus&#x27; voyage to the New World just a few months later in 1492, declared that all Jews in their territories should either convert to Christianity or leave the country. While some converted, many others left for Portugal, France, Italy (including the Papal States), Netherlands, Poland, the Ottoman Empire, and North Africa. Many of those who had fled to Portugal were later expelled by King Manuel in 1497 or left to avoid forced conversion and persecution.

==From the Renaissance to the 17th century==
===Cum Nimis Absurdum===
On 14 July 1555, Pope Paul IV issued papal bull Cum nimis absurdum which revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and placed religious and economic restrictions on Jews in the Papal States, renewed anti-Jewish legislation and subjected Jews to various degradations and restrictions on their freedom.

The bull established the Roman Ghetto and required Jews of Rome, which had existed as a community since before Christian times and which numbered about 2,000 at the time, to live in it. The Ghetto was a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. Jews were also restricted to one synagogue per city.

Paul IV&#x27;s successor, Pope Pius IV, enforced the creation of other ghettos in most Italian towns, and his successor, Pope Pius V, recommended them to other bordering states.

===Protestant Reformation===

Martin Luther at first made overtures towards the Jews, believing that the &quot;evils&quot; of Catholicism had prevented their conversion to Christianity. When his call to convert to his version of Christianity was unsuccessful, he became hostile to them.

In his book &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;, Luther excoriates them as &quot;venomous beasts, vipers, disgusting scum, canders, devils incarnate.&quot; He provided detailed recommendations for a pogrom against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion, writing &quot;Their private houses must be destroyed and devastated, they could be lodged in stables. Let the magistrates burn their synagogues and let whatever escapes be covered with sand and mud. Let them be forced to work, and if this avails nothing, we will be compelled to expel them like dogs in order not to expose ourselves to incurring divine wrath and eternal damnation from the Jews and their lies.&quot; At one point he wrote: &quot;...we are at fault in not slaying them...&quot; a passage that &quot;may be termed the first work of modern anti-Semitism, and a giant step forward on the road to the Holocaust.&quot;

Luther&#x27;s harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian anti-Semitism. In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached: &quot;We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord,&quot; but also in the same sermon stated that Jews were &quot;our public enemy&quot; and if they refused conversion were &quot;malicious,&quot; guilty of blasphemy and would work to kill gentile believers in Christ.

==18th century==

In accordance with the anti-Jewish precepts of the Russian Orthodox Church, Russia&#x27;s discriminatory policies towards Jews intensified when the partition of Poland in the 18th century resulted, for the first time in Russian history, in the possession of land with a large Jewish population. This land was designated as the Pale of Settlement from which Jews were forbidden to migrate into the interior of Russia. In 1772 Catherine II, the empress of Russia, forced the Jews living in the Pale of Settlement to stay in their &quot;shtetls&quot; and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland.

==19th century==
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, the Roman Catholic Church still incorporated strong anti-Semitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism (opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds) and racial anti-Semitism. Brown University historian David Kertzer, working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book &quot;The Popes Against the Jews&quot; that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between &quot;good anti-Semitism&quot; and &quot;bad anti-Semitism&quot;. The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about the accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when they were accused of promoting hatred of Jews, they would remind people that they condemned the &quot;bad&quot; kind of anti-Semitism. Kertzer&#x27;s work is not without critics. Jewish-Christian relations scholar Rabbi David G. Dalin, for example, criticized Kertzer in the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; for using evidence selectively.

===Opposition to the French Revolution===

The counter-revolutionary Catholic royalist Louis de Bonald stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the French Revolution. Bonald&#x27;s attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced Napoleon&#x27;s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews. Bonald&#x27;s article (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian anti-Semitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux, Charles Maurras, and Édouard Drumont, nationalists such as Maurice Barrès and Paolo Orano, and anti-Semitic socialists such as Alphonse Toussenel. Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an &quot;alien&quot; people, a &quot;state within a state&quot;, and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.

In the 1840s, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist Louis Veuillot propagated Bonald&#x27;s arguments against the Jewish &quot;financial aristocracy&quot; along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a &quot;deicidal people&quot; driven by hatred to &quot;enslave&quot; Christians. Gougenot des Mousseaux&#x27;s (1869) has been called a &quot;Bible of modern anti-Semitism&quot; and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty anti-Semitic books blaming France&#x27;s ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.

In Italy, the Jesuit priest Antonio Bresciani&#x27;s highly popular novel 1850 novel &quot;L&#x27;Ebreo di Verona&quot; (&quot;The Jew of Verona&quot;) shaped religious anti-Semitism for decades, as did his work for &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot;, which he helped launch.

Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) had the walls of the Jewish ghetto in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were emancipated by Napoleon, and Jews were restricted to the ghetto through the end of the Papal States in 1870. Official Catholic organizations, such as the Jesuits, banned candidates &quot;who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church&quot; until 1946.

==20th century==
In Russia, under the Tsarist regime, anti-Semitism intensified in the early years of the 20th century and was given official favor when the secret police forged the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a fabricated document purported to be a transcription of a plan by Jewish elders to achieve global domination. Violence against the Jews in the Kishinev pogrom in 1903 was continued after the 1905 revolution by the activities of the Black Hundreds. The Beilis Trial of 1913 showed that it was possible to revive the blood libel accusation in Russia.

Catholic writers such as Ernest Jouin, who published the &quot;Protocols&quot; in French, seamlessly blended racial and religious anti-Semitism, as in his statement that &quot;from the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.&quot; Pope Pius XI praised Jouin for &quot;combating our mortal [Jewish] enemy&quot; and appointed him to high papal office as a protonotary apostolic.

===From WWI to the eve of WWII===
In 1916, in the midst of the First World War, American Jews petitioned Pope Benedict XV on behalf of the Polish Jews.

===Nazi anti-Semitism===
During a meeting with Roman Catholic Bishop Wilhelm Berning of Osnabrück On April 26, 1933, Hitler declared:

I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism, the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.
The transcript of the discussion does not contain any response by Bishop Berning. Martin Rhonheimer does not consider this unusual because in his opinion, for a Catholic Bishop in 1933, there was nothing particularly objectionable &quot;in this historically correct reminder&quot;.

The Nazis used Martin Luther&#x27;s book, &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot; (1543), to justify their claim that their ideology was morally righteous. Luther seems to advocate the murder of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity by writing that &quot;we are at fault in not slaying them.&quot;

Archbishop Robert Runcie asserted that: &quot;Without centuries of Christian anti-Semitism, Hitler&#x27;s passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed... because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. On Good Friday in times past, Jews have cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking &#x27;revenge&#x27; for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable.&quot; The dissident Catholic priest Hans Küng has written that &quot;Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years&#x27; pre-history of &#x27;Christian&#x27; anti-Judaism...&quot; The consensus among historians is that Nazism as a whole was either unrelated or actively opposed to Christianity, and Hitler was strongly critical of it, although Germany remained mostly Christian during the Nazi era.

The document Dabru Emet was issued by over 220 rabbis and intellectuals from all branches of Judaism in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document states,
Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.
According to American historian Lucy Dawidowicz, anti-Semitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of &quot;anti-Semitic descent&quot; from Luther, the author of &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;, to Hitler is &quot;easy to draw.&quot; In her &quot;The War Against the Jews, 1933–1945&quot;, she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the &quot;demonologized universe&quot; inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther&#x27;s anti-Jewish writings and modern anti-Semitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of &quot;Judenhass&quot;, which can be traced to Haman&#x27;s advice to Ahasuerus. Although modern German anti-Semitism also has its roots in German nationalism and the liberal revolution of 1848, Christian anti-Semitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the Roman Catholic Church and &quot;upon which Luther built.&quot;

====Collaborating Christians====

* German Christians (movement)
* &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;
* Hanns Kerrl, Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs
* Positive Christianity (the approved Nazi version of Christianity)
* Protestant Reich Church

====Opposition to the Holocaust====
The Confessing Church was, in 1934, the first Christian opposition group. The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;, signed by Pope Pius XI, and Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber led the Catholic opposition, preaching against racism.

Many individual Christian clergy and laypeople of all denominations had to pay for their opposition with their lives, including:
* the Catholic priest Maximilian Kolbe.
* the Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer
* the Catholic parson of the Berlin Cathedral, Bernhard Lichtenberg.
* the mostly Catholic members of the Munich-based resistance group the White Rose which was led by Hans and Sophie Scholl.

By the 1940s, few Christians were willing to publicly oppose Nazi policy, but many Christians secretly helped save the lives of Jews. There are many sections of Israel&#x27;s Holocaust Remembrance Museum, Yad Vashem, which are dedicated to honoring these &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;.

====Pope Pius XII====
Before he became Pope, Cardinal Pacelli addressed the International Eucharistic Congress in Budapest on 25–30 May 1938 during which he referred to the Jews &quot;whose lips curse [Christ] and whose hearts reject him even today&quot;; at this time anti-Semitic laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary.

The 1937 encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; was issued by Pope Pius XI, but drafted by the future Pope Pius XII and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology and has been characterized by scholars as the &quot;first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.&quot;

In the summer of 1942, Pius explained to his college of Cardinals the reasons for the great gulf that existed between Jews and Christians at the theological level: &quot;Jerusalem has responded to His call and to His grace with the same rigid blindness and stubborn ingratitude that has led it along the path of guilt to the murder of God.&quot; Historian Guido Knopp describes these comments of Pius as being &quot;incomprehensible&quot; at a time when &quot;Jerusalem was being murdered by the million&quot;. This traditional adversarial relationship with Judaism would be reversed in &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, which was issued during the Second Vatican Council starting from 1962, during the papacy of John XXIII.

Prominent members of the Jewish community have contradicted the criticisms of Pius and spoke highly of his efforts to protect Jews. The Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands&quot;. Some historians dispute this estimate.

===&quot;White Power&quot; movement===
The Christian Identity movement, the Ku Klux Klan, and other White supremacist groups have expressed anti-Semitic views. They claim that their anti-Semitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media, control of international banks, involvement in radical left-wing politics, and the Jews&#x27; promotion of multiculturalism, anti-Christian groups, liberalism and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of racism by claiming that Jews who share their views maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief that is common among these groups, but not universal among them, is an alternative history doctrine concerning the descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel. In some of its forms, this doctrine absolutely denies the view that modern Jews have any ethnic connection to the Israel of the Bible. Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine, the true Israelites and the true humans are the members of the Adamic (white) race. These groups are often rejected and they are not even considered Christian groups by mainstream Christian denominations and the vast majority of Christians around the world.

===Post World War II anti-Semitism===
Anti-Semitism remains a substantial problem in Europe and to a greater or lesser degree, it also exists in many other nations, including Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and tensions between some Muslim immigrants and Jews have increased across Europe. The US State Department reports that anti-Semitism has increased dramatically in Europe and Eurasia since 2000.

While it has been on the decline since the 1940s, a measurable amount of anti-Semitism still exists in the United States, although acts of violence are rare. For example, the influential Evangelical preacher Billy Graham and the then-president Richard Nixon were caught on tape in the early 1970s while they were discussing matters like how to address the Jews&#x27; control of the American media. This belief in Jewish conspiracies and domination of the media was similar to those of Graham&#x27;s former mentors: William Bell Riley chose Graham to succeed him as the second president of Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School and evangelist Mordecai Ham led the meetings where Graham first believed in Christ. Both held strongly anti-Semitic views. The 2001 survey by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish group which is devoted to fighting anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, reported 1432 acts of anti-Semitism in the United States that year. The figure included 877 acts of harassment, including verbal intimidation, threats, and physical assaults. Many Christian Zionists are also accused of anti-Semitism, such as John Hagee, who argued that the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves by angering God.

Relations between Jews and Christians have dramatically improved since the 20th century. According to a global poll which was conducted in 2014 by the ADL, data was collected from 102 countries concerning their population&#x27;s attitudes towards Jews and it revealed that only 24% of the world&#x27;s Christians held views that were considered anti-Semitic according to the ADL&#x27;s index, compared to 49% of the world&#x27;s Muslims.

==Anti-Judaism==

Many Christians do not consider anti-Judaism anti-Semitism. They regard anti-Judaism as a disagreement with the tenets of Judaism by religiously sincere people, while they regard anti-Semitism as an emotional bias or hatred which does not specifically target the religion of Judaism. Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as anti-Semitism because it does not involve actual hostility towards the Jewish people, instead, anti-Judaism only rejects the religious beliefs of Judaism.

Others believe that anti-Judaism is the rejection of Judaism as a religion or opposition to Judaism&#x27;s beliefs and practices &quot;essentially because&quot; of their source in Judaism or because a belief or practice is associated with the Jewish people. (But see supersessionism)

Several scholars, including Susannah Heschel, Gavin I Langmuir and Uriel Tal hold the position that anti-Judaism directly led to modern anti-Semitism. Pope John Paul II in &#x27;We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,&#x27; and the Jewish declaration on Christianity, Dabru Emet opinionated the position that &quot;Christian theological anti-Judaism is a phenomenon which is distinct from modern anti-Semitism, which is rooted in economic and racial thought, so that Christian teachings should not be held responsible for anti-Semitism&quot;.

Although some Christians did consider anti-Judaism to be contrary to Christian teaching in the past, this view was not widely expressed by Christian leaders and lay people. In many cases, the practical tolerance towards the Jewish religion and Jews prevailed. Some Christian groups condemned verbal anti-Judaism, particularly in their early years.

==Conversion of Jews==

Some Jewish organizations have denounced evangelistic and missionary activities that specifically target Jews by labeling them anti-Semitic.

The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), the largest Protestant Christian denomination in the U.S., has explicitly rejected suggestions that it should back away from seeking to convert Jews, a position which critics have called anti-Semitic, but a position which Baptists believe is consistent with their view that salvation is solely found through faith in Christ. In 1996 the SBC approved a resolution calling for efforts to seek the conversion of Jews &quot;as well as the salvation of &#x27;every kindred and tongue and people and nation.&#x27;&quot;

Most Evangelicals agree with the SBC&#x27;s position, and some of them also support efforts that specifically seek the Jews&#x27; conversion. Additionally, these Evangelical groups are among the most pro-Israel groups. (&quot;For more information, see Christian Zionism&quot;.) One controversial group which has received a considerable amount of support from some Evangelical churches is Jews for Jesus, which claims that Jews can &quot;complete&quot; their Jewish faith by accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

The Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Methodist Church, and the United Church of Canada have ended their efforts to convert Jews. While Anglicans do not, as a rule, seek converts from other Christian denominations, the General Synod has affirmed that &quot;the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ is for all and must be shared with all including people from other faiths or of no faith and that to do anything else would be to institutionalize discrimination&quot;.

The Roman Catholic Church formerly operated religious congregations that specifically aimed to convert Jews. Some of these congregations were founded by Jewish converts, like the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion, whose members were nuns and ordained priests. Many Catholic saints were specifically noted for their missionary zeal to convert Jews, such as Vincent Ferrer. After the Second Vatican Council, many missionary orders that aimed to convert Jews to Christianity no longer actively sought to missionize (or proselytize) them. However, Traditionalist Roman Catholic groups, congregations, and clergymen continue to advocate the missionizing of Jews according to traditional patterns, sometimes with success (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Society of St. Pius X which has notable Jewish converts among its faithful, many of whom have become traditionalist priests).

The Church&#x27;s Ministry Among Jewish People (CMJ) is one of the ten official mission agencies of the Church of England. The Society for Distributing Hebrew Scriptures is another organization, but it is not affiliated with the established Church.

There are several prophecies concerning the conversion of the Jewish people to Christianity in the scriptures of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). The Book of Mormon teaches that the Jewish people need to believe in Jesus to be gathered to Israel. The Doctrine &amp; Covenants teaches that the Jewish people will be converted to Christianity during the second coming when Jesus appears to them and shows them his wounds. It teaches that if the Jewish people do not convert to Christianity, then the world would be cursed. Early LDS prophets, such as Brigham Young and Wildord Woodruff, taught that Jewish people could not be truly converted because of the curse which resulted from Jewish deicide. However, after the establishment of the state of Israel, many LDS members felt that it was time for the Jewish people to start converting to Mormonism. During the 1950s, the LDS Church established several missions that specifically targeted Jewish people in several cities in the United States. After the LDS church began to give the priesthood to all males regardless of race in 1978, it also started to deemphasize the importance of race concerning conversion. This led to a void of doctrinal teachings that resulted in a spectrum of views on how LDS members interpret scripture and previous teachings. According to research which was conducted by Armand Mauss, most LDS members believe that the Jewish people will need to be converted to Christianity to be forgiven for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has also been criticized for baptizing deceased Jewish Holocaust victims. In 1995, in part as a result of public pressure, church leaders promised to put new policies into place that would help the church to end the practice, unless it was specifically requested or approved by the surviving spouses, children or parents of the victims. However, the practice has continued, including the baptism of the parents of Holocaust survivor and Jewish rights advocate Simon Wiesenthal.

==Reconciliation between Judaism and Christian groups==

In recent years, there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jews.

<text>The McDonnell Douglas/Boeing C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF) between the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.

The C-17 is based upon the YC-15, a smaller prototype airlifter designed during the 1970s. It was designed to replace the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, and also fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. Compared to the YC-15, the redesigned airlifter differed in being larger, having swept wings, and more powerful engines. Development was protracted by a series of design issues, causing the company to incur a loss of nearly US$1.5 billion on the program&#x27;s development phase. On 15 September 1991, roughly one year behind schedule, the first C-17 performed its maiden flight. The C-17 formally entered USAF service on 17 January 1995. Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, continued to manufacture the C-17 for almost two decades. The final C-17 was completed at the Long Beach, California, plant and flown on 29 November 2015.

The C-17 commonly performs tactical and strategic airlift missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include medical evacuation and airdrop duties. The transport is in service with the USAF along with air arms of India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and the Europe-based multilateral organization Heavy Airlift Wing.

The type played a key logistical role during both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, as well as in providing humanitarian aid in the aftermath of various natural disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Sindh floods and the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.

==Development==
===Background and design phase===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force began looking for a replacement for its Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical cargo aircraft. The Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition was held, with Boeing proposing the YC-14, and McDonnell Douglas proposing the YC-15. Though both entrants exceeded specified requirements, the AMST competition was canceled before a winner was selected. The USAF started the C-X program in November 1979 to develop a larger AMST with longer range to augment its strategic airlift.

By 1980, the USAF had a large fleet of aging C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, increased strategic airlift capabilities was needed to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas chose to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15. Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted both a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposal, then designated &quot;C-17&quot;. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines. This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and to fulfill some of the duties of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo.

Alternative proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest. These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of KC-10s, and expansion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years. During this time contracts were awarded for preliminary design work and for the completion of engine certification. In December 1985, a full-scale development contract was awarded, under Program Manager Bob Clepper. At this time, first flight was planned for 1990. The USAF had formed a requirement for 210 aircraft.

Development problems and limited funding caused delays in the late 1980s. Criticisms were made of the developing aircraft and questions were raised about more cost-effective alternatives during this time. In April 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reduced the order from 210 to 120 aircraft. The maiden flight of the C-17 took place on 15 September 1991 from the McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s plant in Long Beach, California, about a year behind schedule. The first aircraft (T-1) and five more production models (P1-P5) participated in extensive flight testing and evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base. Two complete airframes were built for static and repeated load testing.

===Development difficulties===
A static test of the C-17 wing in October 1992 resulted in its failure at 128% of design limit load, below the 150% requirement. Both wings buckled rear to the front and failures occurred in stringers, spars, and ribs. Some $100 million was spent to redesign the wing structure; the wing failed at 145% during a second test in September 1993. A review of the test data, however, showed that the wing was not loaded correctly and did indeed meet the requirement. The C-17 received the &quot;Globemaster III&quot; name in early 1993. In late 1993, the Department of Defense (DoD) gave the contractor two years to solve production issues and cost overruns or face the contract&#x27;s termination after the delivery of the 40th aircraft. By accepting the 1993 terms, McDonnell Douglas incurred a loss of nearly US$1.5 billion on the program&#x27;s development phase.

In March 1994, the Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft program was established to procure a transport aircraft using commercial practices as a possible alternative or supplement to the C-17. Initial material solutions considered included: buy a modified Boeing 747-400 NDAA, restart the C-5 production line, extend the C-141 service life, and continue C-17 production. The field eventually narrowed to: the Boeing 747-400 (provisionally named the C-33), the Lockheed Martin C-5D, and the McDonnell Douglas C-17. The NDAA program was initiated after the C-17 program was temporarily capped at a 40-aircraft buy (in December 1993) pending further evaluation of C-17 cost and performance and an assessment of commercial airlift alternatives.

In April 1994, the program remained over budget and did not meet weight, fuel burn, payload, and range specifications. It failed several key criteria during airworthiness evaluation tests. Problems were found with the mission software, landing gear, and other areas. In May 1994, it was proposed to cut production to as few as 32 aircraft; these cuts were later rescinded. A July 1994 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that USAF and DoD studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5, but these studies had only considered runway dimensions, but not runway strength or load classification numbers (LCN). The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classifies both in the same broad load classification group. When considering runway dimensions and load ratings, the C-17&#x27;s worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields. The report also stated &quot;current military doctrine that does not reflect the use of small, austere airfields&quot;, thus the C-17&#x27;s short field capability was not considered.

A January 1995 GAO report stated that the USAF originally planned to order 210 C-17s at a cost of $41.8 billion, and that the 120 aircraft on order were to cost $39.5 billion based on a 1992 estimate. In March 1994, the U.S. Army decided it did not need the low-altitude parachute-extraction system delivery with the C-17 and that the C-130&#x27;s capability was sufficient. C-17 testing was limited to this lower weight. Airflow issues prevented the C-17 from meeting airdrop requirements. A February 1997 GAO report revealed that a C-17 with a full payload could not land on wet runways; simulations suggested a distance of was required. The YC-15 was transferred to AMARC to be made flightworthy again for further flight tests for the C-17 program in March 1997.

By September 1995, most of the prior issues were reportedly resolved and the C-17 was meeting all performance and reliability targets. The first USAF squadron was declared operational in January 1995.

===Production and deliveries===
In 1996, the DoD ordered another 80 aircraft for a total of 120. In 1997, McDonnell Douglas merged with domestic competitor Boeing. In April 1999, Boeing offered to cut the C-17&#x27;s unit price if the USAF bought 60 more; in August 2002, the order was increased to 180 aircraft. In 2007, 190 C-17s were on order for the USAF. On 6 February 2009, Boeing was awarded a $2.95 billion contract for 15 additional C-17s, increasing the total USAF fleet to 205 and extending production from August 2009 to August 2010. On 6 April 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that there would be no more C-17s ordered beyond the 205 planned. However, on 12 June 2009, the House Armed Services Air and Land Forces Subcommittee added a further 17 C-17s.

Debate arose over follow-on C-17 orders, the USAF requested line shutdown while Congress called for further production. In FY2007, the USAF requested $1.6 billion (~$ in ) in response to &quot;excessive combat use&quot; on the C-17 fleet. In 2008, USAF General Arthur Lichte, Commander of Air Mobility Command, indicated before a House of Representatives subcommittee on air and land forces a need to extend production to another 15 aircraft to increase the total to 205, and that C-17 production may continue to satisfy airlift requirements. The USAF finally decided to cap its C-17 fleet at 223 aircraft; the final delivery was on 12 September 2013.

In 2010, Boeing reduced the production rate to 10 aircraft per year from a high of 16 per year, due to dwindling orders and to extend the production line&#x27;s life while additional orders were sought. The workforce was reduced by about 1,100 through 2012, a second shift at the Long Beach plant was also eliminated. By April 2011, 230 production C-17s had been delivered, including 210 to the USAF. The C-17 prototype &quot;T-1&quot; was retired in 2012 after use as a testbed by the USAF. In January 2010, the USAF announced the end of Boeing&#x27;s performance-based logistics contracts to maintain the type. On 19 June 2012, the USAF ordered its 224th and final C-17 to replace one that crashed in Alaska in July 2010.

In September 2013, Boeing announced that C-17 production was starting to close down. In October 2014, the main wing spar of the 279th and last aircraft was completed; this C-17 was delivered in 2015, after which Boeing closed the Long Beach plant. Production of spare components was to continue until at least 2017. The C-17 is projected to be in service for several decades. In February 2014, Boeing was engaged in sales talks with &quot;five or six&quot; countries for the remaining 15 C-17s; thus Boeing decided to build ten aircraft without confirmed buyers in anticipation of future purchases.

In May 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Boeing expected to book a charge of under $100 million and cut 3,000 positions associated with the C-17 program, and also suggested that Airbus&#x27; lower cost A400M Atlas took international sales away from the C-17.

==Design==
The C-17 Globemaster III is a strategic transport aircraft, able to airlift cargo close to a battle area. The size and weight of U.S. mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in recent decades from increased air mobility requirements, particularly for large or heavy non-palletized outsize cargo. It has a length of and a wingspan of , and uses about 8% composite materials, mostly in secondary structure and control surfaces. The aircraft features an anhedral wing configuration, providing pitch and roll stability to the aircraft. The aircraft&#x27;s stability is furthered by its T-tail design, raising the center of pressure even higher above the center of mass. Drag is also lowered, as the horizontal stabilizer is far removed from the vortices generated by the two wings of the aircraft.

The C-17 is powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines, which are based on the commercial Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757. Each engine is rated at of thrust. The engine&#x27;s thrust reversers direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back up the aircraft while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In vortex surfing tests performed by two C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.
For cargo operations the C-17 requires a crew of three: pilot, copilot, and loadmaster. The cargo compartment is long by wide by high. The cargo floor has rollers for palletized cargo but it can be flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) M1 Abrams main battle tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo.

Maximum payload of the C-17 is , and its maximum takeoff weight is . With a payload of and an initial cruise altitude of , the C-17 has an unrefueled range of about on the first 71 aircraft, and on all subsequent extended-range models that include a sealed center wing bay as a fuel tank. Boeing informally calls these aircraft the &quot;C-17 ER&quot;. The C-17&#x27;s cruise speed is about (Mach 0.74). It is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers and their equipment. According to Boeing the maximum unloaded range is .

The C-17 is designed to operate from runways as short as and as narrow as . The C-17 can also operate from unpaved, unimproved runways (although with a higher probability to damage the aircraft). The thrust reversers can be used to move the aircraft backwards and reverse direction on narrow taxiways using a three- (or more) point turn. The plane is designed for 20 man-hours of maintenance per flight hour, and a 74% mission availability rate.

==Operational history==
===United States Air Force===
The first production C-17 was delivered to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, on 14 July 1993. The first C-17 unit, the 17th Airlift Squadron, became operationally ready on 17 January 1995. It has broken 22 records for oversized payloads. The C-17 was awarded U.S. aviation&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Collier Trophy, in 1994. A Congressional report on operations in Kosovo and Operation Allied Force noted &quot;One of the great success stories...was the performance of the Air Force&#x27;s C-17A&quot; It flew half of the strategic airlift missions in the operation, the type could use small airfields, easing operations; rapid turnaround times also led to efficient utilization.

In 2006, eight C-17s were delivered to March Joint Air Reserve Base, California; controlled by the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), assigned to the 452nd Air Mobility Wing and subsequently assigned to AMC&#x27;s 436th Airlift Wing and its AFRC &quot;associate&quot; unit, the 512th Airlift Wing, at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, supplementing the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The Mississippi Air National Guard&#x27;s 172 Airlift Group received their first of eight C-17s in 2006. In 2011, the New York Air National Guard&#x27;s 105th Airlift Wing at Stewart Air National Guard Base transitioned from the C-5 to the C-17.

C-17s delivered military supplies during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as humanitarian aid in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the 2011 Sindh floods, delivering thousands of food rations, tons of medical and emergency supplies. On 26 March 2003, 15 USAF C-17s participated in the biggest combat airdrop since the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989: the night-time airdrop of 1,000 paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade occurred over Bashur, Iraq. These airdrops were followed by C-17s ferrying M1 Abrams, M2 Bradleys, M113s and artillery. USAF C-17s have also assisted allies in their airlift needs, such as Canadian vehicles to Afghanistan in 2003 and Australian forces for the Australian-led military deployment to East Timor in 2006. In 2006, USAF C-17s flew 15 Canadian Leopard C2 tanks from Kyrgyzstan into Kandahar in support of NATO&#x27;s Afghanistan mission. In 2013, five USAF C-17s supported French operations in Mali, operating with other nations&#x27; C-17s (RAF, NATO and RCAF deployed a single C-17 each).

Flight crews have nicknamed the aircraft &quot;the Moose&quot;, because during ground refueling, the pressure relief vents make a sound like the call of a female moose in heat.

Since 1999, C-17s have flown annually to Antarctica on Operation Deep Freeze in support of the US Antarctic Research Program, replacing the C-141s used in prior years. The initial flight was flown by the USAF 62nd Airlift Wing. The C-17s fly round trip between Christchurch Airport and McMurdo Station around October each year and take 5 hours to fly each way. In 2006, the C-17 flew its first Antarctic airdrop mission, delivering 70,000 pounds of supplies. Further air drops occurred during subsequent years.
A C-17 accompanies the President of the United States on his visits to both domestic and foreign arrangements, consultations, and meetings. It is used to transport the Presidential Limousine, Marine One, and security detachments. On several occasions, a C-17 has been used to transport the President himself, using the Air Force One call sign while doing so.

====Rapid Dragon missile launcher testing====
In 2015, as part of a missile-defense test at Wake Island, simulated medium-range ballistic missiles were launched from C-17s against THAAD missile defense systems and the USS &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (DDG-53). In early 2020, palletized munitions–&quot;Combat Expendable Platforms&quot;– were tested from C-17s and C-130Js with results the USAF considered positive.

In 2021, the Air Force Research Laboratory further developed the concept into tests of the Rapid Dragon system, which transforms the C-17 into a lethal cruise missile arsenal ship capable of mass launching 45 JASSM-ER with 500 kg warheads from a standoff distance of . Anticipated improvements included support for JDAM-ER, mine laying, drone dispersal as well as improved standoff range when full production of the JASSM-XR was expected to deliver large inventories in 2024.

====Evacuation of Afghanistan====
On 15 August 2021, USAF C-17 02-1109 from the 62nd Airlift Wing and 446th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord departed Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, while crowds of people trying to escape the 2021 Taliban offensive ran alongside the aircraft. The C-17 lifted off with people holding on to the outside, and at least two died after falling from the aircraft. There were an unknown number possibly crushed and killed by the landing gear retracting, with human remains found in the landing-gear stowage. Also that day, C-17 01-0186 from the 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron at Al Udeid Air Base transported 823 Afghan citizens from Hamid Karzai International Airport on a single flight, setting a new record for the type, which was previously over 670 people during a 2013 typhoon evacuation from Tacloban, Philippines.

===Royal Air Force===
Boeing marketed the C-17 to many European nations including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Royal Air Force (RAF) has established an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review identified a requirement for a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift competition commenced in September of that year, but the tender was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/BAe C-17 bid, and others unsuitable. The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite. In the light of Airbus A400M delays, the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of £100 million from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s in line with the USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them. The lease agreement restricted the C-17&#x27;s operational use, meaning that the RAF could not use them for para-drop, airdrop, rough field, low-level operations and air to air refueling.

The first C-17 was delivered to the RAF at Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach facility on 17 May 2001 and flown to RAF Brize Norton by a crew from No. 99 Squadron. The RAF&#x27;s fourth C-17 was delivered on 24 August 2001. The RAF aircraft were some of the first to take advantage of the new center wing fuel tank found in Block 13 aircraft. In RAF service, the C-17 has not been given an official service name and designation (for example, C-130J referred to as Hercules C4 or C5), but is referred to simply as the C-17 or &quot;C-17A Globemaster&quot;. Although it was to be a fallback for the A400M, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced on 21 July 2004 that they had elected to buy their four C-17s at the end of the lease, though the A400M appeared to be closer to production. The C-17 gives the RAF strategic capabilities that it would not wish to lose, for example a maximum payload of compared to the A400M&#x27;s . The C-17&#x27;s capabilities allow the RAF to use it as an airborne hospital for medical evacuation missions.

Another C-17 was ordered in August 2006, and delivered on 22 February 2008. The four leased C-17s were to be purchased later in 2008. Due to fears that the A400M may suffer further delays, the MoD announced in 2006 that it planned to acquire three more C-17s, for a total of eight, with delivery in 2009–2010. On 3 December 2007, the MoD announced a contract for a sixth C-17, which was received on 11 June 2008. On 18 December 2009, Boeing confirmed that the RAF had ordered a seventh C-17, which was delivered on 16 November 2010. The UK announced the purchase of its eighth C-17 in February 2012. The RAF showed interest in buying a ninth C-17 in November 2013.

On 13 January 2013, the RAF deployed two C-17s from RAF Brize Norton to the French Évreux Air Base, transporting French armored vehicles to the Malian capital of Bamako during the French intervention in Mali. In June 2015, an RAF C-17 was used to medically evacuate four victims of the 2015 Sousse attacks from Tunisia. On 13 September 2022, C-17 ZZ177 carried the body of Queen Elizabeth II from Edinburgh Airport to RAF Northolt in London. She had been lying in state at St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh, Scotland.

===Royal Australian Air Force===

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began investigating an acquisition of strategic transport aircraft in 2005. In late 2005, the then Minister for Defence Robert Hill stated that such aircraft were being considered due to the limited availability of strategic airlift aircraft from partner nations and air freight companies. The C-17 was considered to be favored over the A400M as it was a &quot;proven aircraft&quot; and in production. One major RAAF requirement was the ability to airlift the Army&#x27;s M1 Abrams tanks; another requirement was immediate delivery. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the RAF was also considered advantageous. RAAF aircraft were ordered directly from the USAF production run and are identical to American C-17s even in paint scheme, the only difference being the national markings, allowing deliveries to commence within nine months of commitment to the program.

On 2 March 2006, the Australian government announced the purchase of three aircraft and one option with an entry into service date of 2006. In July 2006, Boeing was awarded a fixed price contract to deliver four C-17s for (). Australia also signed a US$80.7M contract to join the global &#x27;virtual fleet&#x27; C-17 sustainment program; RAAF C-17s receive the same upgrades as the USAF&#x27;s fleet.

The RAAF took delivery of its first C-17 in a ceremony at Boeing&#x27;s plant at Long Beach, California on 28 November 2006. Several days later the aircraft flew from Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii to Defence Establishment Fairbairn, Canberra, arriving on 4 December 2006. The aircraft was formally accepted in a ceremony at Fairbairn shortly after arrival. The second aircraft was delivered to the RAAF on 11 May 2007 and the third was delivered on 18 December 2007. The fourth Australian C-17 was delivered on 19 January 2008. All the Australian C-17s are operated by No. 36 Squadron and are based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland.

On 18 April 2011, Boeing announced that Australia had signed an agreement with the U.S. government to acquire a fifth C-17 due to an increased demand for humanitarian and disaster relief missions. The aircraft was delivered to the RAAF on 14 September 2011. On 23 September 2011, Australian Minister for Defence Materiel Jason Clare announced that the government was seeking information from the U.S. about the price and delivery schedule for a sixth Globemaster. In November 2011, Australia requested a sixth C-17 through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program; it was ordered in June 2012, and was delivered on 1 November 2012.

In August 2014, Defence Minister David Johnston announced the intention to purchase one or two additional C-17s. On 3 October 2014, Johnston announced the government&#x27;s approval to buy two C-17s at a total cost of (). The United States Congress approved the sale under the Foreign Military Sales program. Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed in April 2015 that two additional aircraft were to be ordered, with both delivered by 4 November 2015; these added to the six C-17s it had .

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
The Canadian Armed Forces had a long-standing need for strategic airlift for military and humanitarian operations around the world. It had followed a pattern similar to the German Air Force in leasing Antonovs and Ilyushins for many requirements, including deploying the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to tsunami-stricken Sri Lanka in 2005; the Canadian Forces had relied entirely on leased An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot; for a Canadian Army deployment to Haiti in 2003. A combination of leased &quot;Ruslans&quot;, Ilyushins and USAF C-17s was also used to move heavy equipment to Afghanistan. In 2002, the Canadian Forces Future Strategic Airlifter Project began to study alternatives, including long-term leasing arrangements.

On 5 July 2006, the Canadian government issued a notice of intent to negotiate with Boeing to procure four airlifters for the Canadian Forces Air Command (Royal Canadian Air Force after August 2011). On 1 February 2007, Canada awarded a contract for four C-17s with delivery beginning in August 2007. Like Australia, Canada was granted airframes originally slated for the USAF to accelerate delivery. The official Canadian designation is &quot;CC-177 Globemaster III&quot;.

On 23 July 2007, the first Canadian C-17 made its initial flight. It was turned over to Canada on 8 August, and participated at the Abbotsford International Airshow on 11 August prior to arriving at its new home base at 8 Wing, CFB Trenton, Ontario on 12 August. Its first operational mission was to deliver disaster relief to Jamaica following Hurricane Dean that month. The last of the initial four aircraft was delivered in April 2008. On 19 December 2014, it was reported that Canada intended to purchase one more C-17. On 30 March 2015, Canada&#x27;s fifth C-17 arrived at CFB Trenton. The aircraft are assigned to 429 Transport Squadron based at CFB Trenton.

On 14 April 2010, a Canadian C-17 landed for the first time at CFS Alert, the world&#x27;s most northerly airport. Canadian Globemasters have been deployed in support of numerous missions worldwide, including Operation Hestia after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, providing airlift as part of Operation Mobile and support to the Canadian mission in Afghanistan. After Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013, Canadian C-17s established an air bridge between the two nations, deploying Canada&#x27;s DART and delivering humanitarian supplies and equipment. In 2014, they supported Operation Reassurance and Operation Impact.

===Strategic Airlift Capability program===
At the 2006 Farnborough Airshow, a number of NATO member nations signed a letter of intent to jointly purchase and operate several C-17s within the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC). The purchase was for two C-17s, and a third was contributed by the U.S. On 14 July 2009, Boeing delivered the first C-17 for the SAC program with the second and third C-17s delivered in September and October 2009. SAC members are Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and the U.S. as of 2024.

The SAC C-17s are based at Pápa Air Base, Hungary. The Heavy Airlift Wing is hosted by Hungary, which acts as the flag nation. The aircraft are crewed in similar fashion as the NATO E-3 AWACS aircraft. The C-17 flight crew are multi-national, but each mission is assigned to an individual member nation based on the SAC&#x27;s annual flight hour share agreement. The NATO Airlift Management Programme Office (NAMPO) provides management and support for the Heavy Airlift Wing. NAMPO is a part of the NATO Support Agency (NSPA). In September 2014, Boeing stated that the three C-17s supporting SAC missions had achieved a readiness rate of nearly 94 percent over the last five years and supported over 1,000 missions.

===Indian Air Force===
In June 2009, the Indian Air Force (IAF) selected the C-17 for its Very Heavy Lift Transport Aircraft requirement to replace several types of transport aircraft. In January 2010, India requested 10 C-17s through the U.S.&#x27;s Foreign Military Sales program, the sale was approved by Congress in June 2010. On 23 June 2010, the IAF successfully test-landed a USAF C-17 at the Gaggal Airport, India to complete the IAF&#x27;s C-17 trials. In February 2011, the IAF and Boeing agreed terms for the order of 10 C-17s with an option for six more; the US$4.1 billion order was approved by the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security on 6 June 2011. Deliveries began in June 2013 and were to continue to 2014. In 2012, the IAF reportedly finalized plans to buy six more C-17s in its five-year plan for 2017–2022.
It provides strategic airlift, the ability to deploy special forces, and to operate in diverse terrain – from Himalayan air bases in North India at to Indian Ocean bases in South India. The C-17s are based at Hindon Air Force Station and are operated by No. 81 Squadron IAF &quot;Skylords&quot;. The first C-17 was delivered in January 2013 for testing and training; it was officially accepted on 11 June 2013. The second C-17 was delivered on 23 July 2013 and put into service immediately. IAF Chief of Air Staff Norman AK Browne called it &quot;a major component in the IAF&#x27;s modernization drive&quot; while taking delivery of the aircraft at Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach factory. On 2 September 2013, the &quot;Skylords&quot; squadron with three C-17s officially entered IAF service.

The &quot;Skylords&quot; regularly fly missions within India, such as to high-altitude bases at Leh and Thoise. The IAF first used the C-17 to transport an infantry battalion&#x27;s equipment to Port Blair on Andaman Islands on 1 July 2013. Foreign deployments to date include Tajikistan in August 2013, and Rwanda to support Indian peacekeepers. One C-17 was used for transporting relief materials during Cyclone Phailin.

The sixth aircraft was received in July 2014. In June 2017, the U.S. Department of State approved the potential sale of one C-17 to India under a proposed $366 million (~$ in ) U.S. Foreign Military Sale. This aircraft, the last C-17 produced, increased the IAF&#x27;s fleet to 11 C-17s. In March 2018, a contract was awarded for completion by 22 August 2019. On 26 August 2019, Boeing delivered the 11th C-17 Globemaster III to the Indian Air Force.

On 7 February 2023, an IAF C-17 delivered humanitarian aid packages for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria by taking a detour around Pakistan&#x27;s airspace in the aftermath of 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

An IAF C-17 executed a precision airdrop of two Combat Rubberised Raiding Craft along with a platoon of 8 MARCOS commandos in an operation to rescue the &quot;ex-MV Ruen&quot;, a Maltese-flagged cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in December 2023. The mission was conducted on 16 March 2024 in a 10-hour round trip mission to an area 2600 km away from the Indian coast. The ship was being used as a mothership for piracy. In a joint operation carried out with the Indian Navy assets such as P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, SeaGuardian drones, destroyer &quot;INS Kolkata&quot; and patrol vessel &quot;INS Subhadra&quot;, the IAF C-17 airdropped Navy&#x27;s MARCOS commandos, who boarded the hijacked ship, rescued 17 sailors and disarmed 35 pirates in the operation.

===Qatar===
Boeing delivered Qatar&#x27;s first C-17 on 11 August 2009 and the second on 10 September 2009 for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. Qatar received its third C-17 in 2012, and fourth C-17 was received on 10 December 2012. In June 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Qatar was allegedly using its C-17s to ship weapons from Libya to the Syrian opposition during the civil war via Turkey. On 15 June 2015, it was announced at the Paris Airshow that Qatar agreed to order four additional C-17s from the five remaining &quot;white tail&quot; C-17s to double Qatar&#x27;s C-17 fleet. One Qatari C-17 bears the civilian markings of government-owned Qatar Airways, although the airplane is owned and operated by the Qatar Emiri Air Force. The head of Qatar&#x27;s airlift selection committee, Ahmed Al-Malki, said the paint scheme was &quot;to build awareness of Qatar&#x27;s participation in operations around the world.&quot;

===United Arab Emirates===
In February 2009, the United Arab Emirates Air Force agreed to buy four C-17s. In January 2010, a contract was signed for six C-17s. In May 2011, the first C-17 was handed over and the final was received in June 2012.

===Kuwait===
Kuwait requested the purchase of one C-17 in September 2010 and a second in April 2013 through the U.S.&#x27;s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The nation ordered two C-17s; the first was delivered on 13 February 2014.

===Proposed operators===
In 2015, New Zealand&#x27;s Minister of Defence, Gerry Brownlee, was considering the purchase of two C-17s for the Royal New Zealand Air Force at an estimated cost of $600 million as a heavy air transport option. However, the New Zealand Government eventually decided not to acquire the C-17.

==Variants==
* C-17A: Initial military airlifter version.
* C-17A &quot;ER&quot;: Unofficial name for C-17As with extended range due to the addition of the center wing tank. This upgrade was incorporated in production beginning in 2001 with Block 13 aircraft.
** Block 16: This software/hardware upgrade was a major improvement of the improved Onboard Inert Gas-Generating System (OBIGGS II), a new weather radar, an improved stabilizer strut system and other avionics.
** Block 21: Adds ADS-B capability, IFF modification, communication/navigation upgrades and improved flight management.
* C-17B: A proposed tactical airlifter version with double-slotted flaps, an additional main landing gear on the center fuselage, more powerful engines, and other systems for shorter landing and take-off distances. Boeing offered the C-17B to the U.S. military in 2007 for carrying the Army&#x27;s Future Combat Systems (FCS) vehicles and other equipment.
* KC-17: Proposed tanker variant of the C-17.
* MD-17: Proposed variant for US airlines participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, later redesignated as BC-17X after 1997 merger.

==Accidents and notable incidents ==

* On 10 September 1998, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;96-0006&quot;) delivered Keiko the orca to Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, a runway, and suffered a landing gear failure during landing. There were no injuries, but the landing gear sustained major damage.
* On 10 December 2003, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;98-0057&quot;) was hit by a surface-to-air missile after take-off from Baghdad, Iraq. One engine was disabled and the aircraft returned for a safe landing. It was repaired and returned to service.
* On 6 August 2005, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;01-0196&quot;) ran off the runway at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan while attempting to land, destroying its nose and main landing gear. After two months making it flightworthy, a test pilot flew the aircraft to Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach facility as the temporary repairs imposed performance limitations. In October 2006, it returned to service following repairs.

* On 30 January 2009, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;96-0002&quot; – &quot;Spirit of the Air Force&quot;) made a gear-up landing at Bagram Air Base. It was ferried from Bagram AB, making several stops along the way, to Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach plant for extensive repairs. The USAF Aircraft Accident Investigation Board concluded the cause was the crew&#x27;s failure to follow the pre-landing checklist and lower the landing gear.
* On 28 July 2010, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;00-0173&quot; – &quot;Spirit of the Aleutians&quot;) crashed at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, while practicing for the 2010 Arctic Thunder Air Show, killing all four aboard. It crashed near a railroad, disrupting rail operations. A military investigation found pilot error caused a stall. This is the C-17&#x27;s only fatal crash and the only hull loss accident.
* On 23 January 2012, a USAF C-17 (AF Serial No. &quot;07-7189&quot;), assigned to the 437th Airlift Wing, Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina, landed on runway 34R at Forward Operating Base Shank, Afghanistan. The crew did not realize the required stopping distance exceeded the runway&#x27;s length thus were unable to stop. It came to rest approximately 700 feet from the runway&#x27;s end upon an embankment, causing major structural damage but no injuries. After 9 months of repairs to make it airworthy, the C-17 flew to Long Beach. It returned to service at a reported cost of $69.4 million.
* On 20 July 2012, a USAF C-17 of the 305th Air Mobility Wing, flying from McGuire AFB, New Jersey, to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, mistakenly landed at nearby Peter O. Knight Airport, a small municipal field without a control tower, with Gen. Jim Mattis, then commander of CENTCOM, on board. After a few hours, the Globemaster took off from the airport&#x27;s runway without incident and made the short trip to MacDill AFB. The mistaken landing followed an extended duration flight from Europe to Southwest Asia to embark military passengers before returning to the U.S. The USAF investigation attributed the incident to fatigue leading to pilot error, as both airfields&#x27; main runways share the same magnetic heading and are only four miles apart along the shore of Tampa Bay.
* On 9 April 2021, USAF C-17 10-0223 suffered a fire in its undercarriage after landing at Charleston AFB following a flight from RAF Mildenhall, UK. The fire spread to the fuselage before it was extinguished.

<text>In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The &quot;garbage collector&quot; attempts to reclaim memory that was allocated by the program, but is no longer referenced; such memory is called &quot;garbage&quot;. Garbage collection was invented by American computer scientist John McCarthy around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.

Garbage collection relieves the programmer from doing manual memory management, where the programmer specifies what objects to de-allocate and return to the memory system and when to do so. Other, similar techniques include stack allocation, region inference, and memory ownership, and combinations thereof. Garbage collection may take a significant proportion of a program&#x27;s total processing time, and affect performance as a result.

Resources other than memory, such as network sockets, database handles, windows, file descriptors, and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection, but rather by other methods (e.g. destructors). Some such methods de-allocate memory also.

== Overview ==

Many programming languages require garbage collection, either as part of the language specification (e.g., RPL, Java, C#, D, Go, and most scripting languages) or effectively for practical implementation (e.g., formal languages like lambda calculus). These are said to be &quot;garbage-collected languages&quot;. Other languages, such as C and C++, were designed for use with manual memory management, but have garbage-collected implementations available. Some languages, like Ada, Modula-3, and C++/CLI, allow both garbage collection and manual memory management to co-exist in the same application by using separate heaps for collected and manually managed objects. Still others, like D, are garbage-collected but allow the user to manually delete objects or even disable garbage collection entirely when speed is required.

Although many languages integrate GC into their compiler and runtime system, &quot;post-hoc&quot; GC systems also exist, such as Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Some of these &quot;post-hoc&quot; GC systems do not require recompilation. 

=== Advantages ===

GC frees the programmer from manually de-allocating memory. This helps avoid some kinds of errors:

* &quot;Dangling pointers&quot;, which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are still pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory may have been reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.
* &quot;Double free bugs&quot;, which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.
* Certain kinds of &quot;memory leaks&quot;, in which a program fails to free memory occupied by objects that have become unreachable, which can lead to memory exhaustion.

=== Disadvantages ===
GC uses computing resources to decide which memory to free. Therefore, the penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source code is overhead, which can impair program performance. A peer-reviewed paper from 2005 concluded that GC needs five times the memory to compensate for this overhead and to perform as fast as the same program using idealized explicit memory management. The comparison however is made to a program generated by inserting deallocation calls using an oracle, implemented by collecting traces from programs run under a profiler, and the program is only correct for one particular execution of the program. Interaction with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing. The impact on performance was given by Apple as a reason for not adopting garbage collection in iOS, despite it being the most desired feature.

The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting in stalls (pauses to shift/free memory) scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in real-time environments, in transaction processing, or in interactive programs. Incremental, concurrent, and real-time garbage collectors address these problems, with varying trade-offs.

== Strategies ==
=== Tracing ===
Tracing garbage collection is the most common type of garbage collection, so much so that &quot;garbage collection&quot; often refers to tracing garbage collection, rather than other methods such as reference counting. The overall strategy consists of determining which objects should be garbage collected by tracing which objects are &quot;reachable&quot; by a chain of references from certain root objects, and considering the rest as garbage and collecting them. However, there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation, with widely varying complexity and performance characteristics.

=== Reference counting ===

Reference counting garbage collection is where each object has a count of the number of references to it. Garbage is identified by having a reference count of zero. An object&#x27;s reference count is incremented when a reference to it is created and decremented when a reference is destroyed. When the count reaches zero, the object&#x27;s memory is reclaimed.

As with manual memory management, and unlike tracing garbage collection, reference counting guarantees that objects are destroyed as soon as their last reference is destroyed, and usually only accesses memory which is either in CPU caches, in objects to be freed, or directly pointed to by those, and thus tends to not have significant negative side effects on CPU cache and virtual memory operation.

There are a number of disadvantages to reference counting; this can generally be solved or mitigated by more sophisticated algorithms:

; Cycles: If two or more objects refer to each other, they can create a cycle whereby neither will be collected as their mutual references never let their reference counts become zero. Some garbage collection systems using reference counting (like the one in CPython) use specific cycle-detecting algorithms to deal with this issue. Another strategy is to use weak references for the &quot;backpointers&quot; which create cycles. Under reference counting, a weak reference is similar to a weak reference under a tracing garbage collector. It is a special reference object whose existence does not increment the reference count of the referent object. Furthermore, a weak reference is safe in that when the referent object becomes garbage, any weak reference to it &quot;lapses&quot;, rather than being permitted to remain dangling, meaning that it turns into a predictable value, such as a null reference.

; Space overhead (reference count): Reference counting requires space to be allocated for each object to store its reference count. The count may be stored adjacent to the object&#x27;s memory or in a side table somewhere else, but in either case, every single reference-counted object requires additional storage for its reference count. Memory space with the size of an unsigned pointer is commonly used for this task, meaning that 32 or 64 bits of reference count storage must be allocated for each object. On some systems, it may be possible to mitigate this overhead by using a tagged pointer to store the reference count in unused areas of the object&#x27;s memory. Often, an architecture does not actually allow programs to access the full range of memory addresses that could be stored in its native pointer size; a certain number of high bits in the address is either ignored or required to be zero. If an object reliably has a pointer at a certain location, the reference count can be stored in the unused bits of the pointer. For example, each object in Objective-C has a pointer to its class at the beginning of its memory; on the ARM64 architecture using iOS 7, 19 unused bits of this class pointer are used to store the object&#x27;s reference count.

; Speed overhead (increment/decrement): In naive implementations, each assignment of a reference and each reference falling out of scope often require modifications of one or more reference counters. However, in a common case when a reference is copied from an outer scope variable into an inner scope variable, such that the lifetime of the inner variable is bounded by the lifetime of the outer one, the reference incrementing can be eliminated. The outer variable &quot;owns&quot; the reference. In the programming language C++, this technique is readily implemented and demonstrated with the use of codice_1 references. Reference counting in C++ is usually implemented using &quot;smart pointers&quot; whose constructors, destructors, and assignment operators manage the references. A smart pointer can be passed by reference to a function, which avoids the need to copy-construct a new smart pointer (which would increase the reference count on entry into the function and decrease it on exit). Instead, the function receives a reference to the smart pointer which is produced inexpensively. The Deutsch-Bobrow method of reference counting capitalizes on the fact that most reference count updates are in fact generated by references stored in local variables. It ignores these references, only counting references in the heap, but before an object with reference count zero can be deleted, the system must verify with a scan of the stack and register that no other reference to it still exists. A further substantial decrease in the overhead on counter updates can be obtained by update coalescing introduced by Levanoni and Petrank. Consider a pointer that in a given interval of the execution is updated several times. It first points to an object codice_2, then to an object codice_3, and so forth until at the end of the interval it points to some object codice_4. A reference counting algorithm would typically execute codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, ..., codice_10. But most of these updates are redundant. In order to have the reference count properly evaluated at the end of the interval it is enough to perform codice_5 and codice_10. Levanoni and Petrank measured an elimination of more than 99% of the counter updates in typical Java benchmarks.

; Requires atomicity: When used in a multithreaded environment, these modifications (increment and decrement) may need to be atomic operations such as compare-and-swap, at least for any objects which are shared, or potentially shared among multiple threads. Atomic operations are expensive on a multiprocessor, and even more expensive if they have to be emulated with software algorithms. It is possible to avoid this issue by adding per-thread or per-CPU reference counts and only accessing the global reference count when the local reference counts become or are no longer zero (or, alternatively, using a binary tree of reference counts, or even giving up deterministic destruction in exchange for not having a global reference count at all), but this adds significant memory overhead and thus tends to be only useful in special cases (it is used, for example, in the reference counting of Linux kernel modules). Update coalescing by Levanoni and Petrank can be used to eliminate all atomic operations from the write-barrier. Counters are never updated by the program threads in the course of program execution. They are only modified by the collector which executes as a single additional thread with no synchronization. This method can be used as a stop-the-world mechanism for parallel programs, and also with a concurrent reference counting collector.

; Not real-time: Naive implementations of reference counting do not generally provide real-time behavior, because any pointer assignment can potentially cause a number of objects bounded only by total allocated memory size to be recursively freed while the thread is unable to perform other work. It is possible to avoid this issue by delegating the freeing of unreferenced objects to other threads, at the cost of extra overhead.

=== Escape analysis ===

Escape analysis is a compile-time technique that can convert heap allocations to stack allocations, thereby reducing the amount of garbage collection to be done. This analysis determines whether an object allocated inside a function is accessible outside of it. If a function-local allocation is found to be accessible to another function or thread, the allocation is said to &quot;escape&quot; and cannot be done on the stack. Otherwise, the object may be allocated directly on the stack and released when the function returns, bypassing the heap and associated memory management costs.

== Availability ==
Generally speaking, higher-level programming languages are more likely to have garbage collection as a standard feature. In some languages lacking built-in garbage collection, it can be added through a library, as with the Boehm garbage collector for C and C++.

Most functional programming languages, such as ML, Haskell, and APL, have garbage collection built in. Lisp is especially notable as both the first functional programming language and the first language to introduce garbage collection.

Other dynamic languages, such as Ruby and Julia (but not Perl 5 or PHP before version 5.3, which both use reference counting), JavaScript and ECMAScript also tend to use GC. Object-oriented programming languages such as Smalltalk, ooRexx, RPL and Java usually provide integrated garbage collection. Notable exceptions are C++ and Delphi, which have destructors.

=== BASIC ===
BASIC and Logo have often used garbage collection for variable-length data types, such as strings and lists, so as not to burden programmers with memory management details. On the Altair 8800, programs with many string variables and little string space could cause long pauses due to garbage collection. Similarly the Applesoft BASIC interpreter&#x27;s garbage collection algorithm repeatedly scans the string descriptors for the string having the highest address in order to compact it toward high memory, resulting in formula_1 performance and pauses anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. A replacement garbage collector for Applesoft BASIC by Randy Wigginton identifies a group of strings in every pass over the heap, reducing collection time dramatically. BASIC.SYSTEM, released with ProDOS in 1983, provides a windowing garbage collector for BASIC that is many times faster.

=== Objective-C ===
While the Objective-C traditionally had no garbage collection, with the release of OS X 10.5 in 2007 Apple introduced garbage collection for Objective-C 2.0, using an in-house developed runtime collector.
However, with the 2012 release of OS X 10.8, garbage collection was deprecated in favor of LLVM&#x27;s automatic reference counter (ARC) that was introduced with OS X 10.7. Furthermore, since May 2015 Apple even forbade the usage of garbage collection for new OS X applications in the App Store. For iOS, garbage collection has never been introduced due to problems in application responsivity and performance; instead, iOS uses ARC.

=== Limited environments ===
Garbage collection is rarely used on embedded or real-time systems because of the usual need for very tight control over the use of limited resources. However, garbage collectors compatible with many limited environments have been developed. The Microsoft .NET Micro Framework, .NET nanoFramework and Java Platform, Micro Edition are embedded software platforms that, like their larger cousins, include garbage collection.

=== Java ===
Garbage collectors available in Java JDKs include:
* G1
* Parallel
* Concurrent mark sweep collector (CMS)
* Serial
* C4 (Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector)
* Shenandoah
* ZGC

=== Compile-time use ===
Compile-time garbage collection is a form of static analysis allowing memory to be reused and reclaimed based on invariants known during compilation.

This form of garbage collection has been studied in the Mercury programming language, and it saw greater usage with the introduction of LLVM&#x27;s automatic reference counter (ARC) into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem (iOS and OS X) in 2011.

=== Real-time systems ===
Incremental, concurrent, and real-time garbage collectors have been developed, for example by Henry Baker and by Henry Lieberman.

In Baker&#x27;s algorithm, the allocation is done in either half of a single region of memory. When it becomes half full, a garbage collection is performed which moves the live objects into the other half and the remaining objects are implicitly deallocated. The running program (the &#x27;mutator&#x27;) has to check that any object it references is in the correct half, and if not move it across, while a background task is finding all of the objects.

Generational garbage collection schemes are based on the empirical observation that most objects die young. In generational garbage collection, two or more allocation regions (generations) are kept, which are kept separate based on the object&#x27;s age. New objects are created in the &quot;young&quot; generation that is regularly collected, and when a generation is full, the objects that are still referenced from older regions are copied into the next oldest generation. Occasionally a full scan is performed.

Some high-level language computer architectures include hardware support for real-time garbage collection.

Most implementations of real-time garbage collectors use tracing. Such real-time garbage collectors meet hard real-time constraints when used with a real-time operating system.

<text>Canidae (; from Latin, &quot;canis&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;) is a biological family of dog-like carnivorans, colloquially referred to as dogs, and constitutes a clade. A member of this family is also called a canid (). The family includes three subfamilies: the Caninae, and the extinct Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. The Caninae are known as canines, and include domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, jackals and other species.

Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied by human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the gray wolf to the fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving co-operatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds and a litter of young are reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and vocalizations. One canid, the domestic dog, originated from a symbiotic relationship with Upper Paleolithic humans and is one of the most widely kept domestic animals.

==Taxonomy==

In the history of the carnivores, the family Canidae is represented by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae. This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. All living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with the extinct borophagines, with both groups having a bicuspid (two points) on the lower carnassial talonid, which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication. This, together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar, and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.

The cat-like Feliformia and dog-like Caniformia emerged within the Carnivoramorpha around 45–42 Mya (million years ago). The Canidae first appeared in North America during the Late Eocene (37.8-33.9 Mya). They did not reach Eurasia until the Late Miocene or to South America until the Late Pliocene.

===Phylogenetic relationships===
This cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of canids within Caniformia, based on fossil finds:
==Evolution==
The Canidae are a diverse group of some 37 species ranging in size from the maned wolf with its long limbs to the short-legged bush dog. Modern canids inhabit forests, tundra, savannas, and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world. The evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied in the past using morphological approaches, but more recently, molecular studies have enabled the investigation of phylogenetics relationships. In some species, genetic divergence has been suppressed by the high level of gene flow between different populations and where the species have hybridized, large hybrid zones exist.

===Eocene epoch===
Carnivorans evolved after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Around 50 million years ago, or earlier, in the Paleocene, the Carnivora split into two main divisions: caniform (dog-like) and feliform (cat-like). By 40 Mya, the first identifiable member of the dog family had arisen. Named &quot;Prohesperocyon wilsoni&quot;, its fossils have been found in southwest Texas. The chief features which identify it as a canid include the loss of the upper third molar (part of a trend toward a more shearing bite), and the structure of the middle ear which has an enlarged bulla (the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts of the ear). &quot;Prohesperocyon&quot; probably had slightly longer limbs than its predecessors, and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from the splayed arrangements of the digits in bears.

Canidae soon divided into three subfamilies, each of which diverged during the Eocene: Hesperocyoninae (about 39.74–15 Mya), Borophaginae (about 34–32 Mya), and Caninae (about 34–30 Mya; the only surviving subfamily). Members of each subfamily showed an increase in body mass with time and some exhibited specialized hypercarnivorous diets that made them prone to extinction.

===Oligocene epoch===
By the Oligocene, all three subfamilies (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae, and Caninae) had appeared in the fossil record of North America. The earliest and most primitive branch of the Canidae was Hesperocyoninae, which included the coyote-sized &quot;Mesocyon&quot; of the Oligocene (38–24 Mya). These early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat; they resembled modern viverrids in appearance. Hesperocyonines eventually became extinct in the middle Miocene. One of the early Hesperocyonines, the genus &quot;Hesperocyon&quot;, gave rise to &quot;Archaeocyon&quot; and &quot;Leptocyon&quot;. These branches led to the borophagine and canine radiations.

===Miocene epoch===
Around 8 Mya, the Beringian land bridge allowed members of the genus &quot;Eucyon&quot; a means to enter Asia from North America and they continued on to colonize Europe.

===Pliocene epoch===
The &quot;Canis&quot;, &quot;Urocyon&quot;, and &quot;Vulpes&quot; genera developed from canids from North America, where the canine radiation began. The success of these canids was related to the development of lower carnassials that were capable of both mastication and shearing. Around 5 million years ago, some of the Old World &quot;Eucyon&quot; evolved into the first members of &quot;Canis&quot;, In the Pliocene, around 4–5 Mya, &quot;Canis lepophagus&quot; appeared in North America. This was small and sometimes coyote-like. Others were wolf-like. &quot;C. latrans&quot; (the coyote) is theorized to descend from &quot;C. lepophagus&quot;.

The formation of the Isthmus of Panama, about 3 Mya, joined South America to North America, allowing canids to invade South America, where they diversified. However, the last common ancestor of the South American canids lived in North America some 4 Mya and more than one incursion across the new land bridge is likely given the fact that more than one lineage is present in South America. Two North American lineages found in South America are the gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargentus&quot;) and the now-extinct dire wolf (&quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;). Besides these, there are species endemic to South America: the maned wolf (&quot;Chrysocyon brachyurus&quot;), the short-eared dog (&quot;Atelocynus microtis&quot;), the bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;), the crab-eating fox (&quot;Cerdocyon thous&quot;), and the South American foxes (&quot;Lycalopex&quot; spp.). The monophyly of this group has been established by molecular means.

===Pleistocene epoch===
During the Pleistocene, the North American wolf line appeared, with &quot;Canis edwardii&quot;, clearly identifiable as a wolf, and &quot;Canis rufus&quot; appeared, possibly a direct descendant of &quot;C. edwardii&quot;. Around 0.8 Mya, &quot;Canis ambrusteri&quot; emerged in North America. A large wolf, it was found all over North and Central America and was eventually supplanted by the dire wolf, which then spread into South America during the Late Pleistocene.

By 0.3 Mya, a number of subspecies of the gray wolf (&quot;C. lupus&quot;) had developed and had spread throughout Europe and northern Asia. The gray wolf colonized North America during the late Rancholabrean era across the Bering land bridge, with at least three separate invasions, with each one consisting of one or more different Eurasian gray wolf clades. MtDNA studies have shown that there are at least four extant &quot;C. lupus&quot; lineages. The dire wolf shared its habitat with the gray wolf, but became extinct in a large-scale extinction event that occurred around 11,500 years ago. It may have been more of a scavenger than a hunter; its molars appear to be adapted for crushing bones and it may have gone extinct as a result of the extinction of the large herbivorous animals on whose carcasses it relied.

In 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole-genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids have colonized Africa from Eurasia at least five times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals, the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species, &quot;Canis anthus&quot; (African golden wolf). According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 Mya, but the African golden wolf separated 1.3 Mya. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicated the Ethiopian wolf diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage slightly prior to that.


Wild canids are found on every continent except Antarctica, and inhabit a wide range of different habitats, including deserts, mountains, forests, and grasslands. They vary in size from the fennec fox, which may be as little as in length and weigh , to the gray wolf, which may be up to long, and can weigh up to . Only a few species are arboreal—the gray fox, the closely related island fox and the raccoon dog habitually climb trees.

All canids have a similar basic form, as exemplified by the gray wolf, although the relative length of muzzle, limbs, ears, and tail vary considerably between species. With the exceptions of the bush dog, the raccoon dog and some domestic dog breeds, canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies, adapted for chasing prey. The tails are bushy and the length and quality of the pelage vary with the season. The muzzle portion of the skull is much more elongated than that of the cat family. The zygomatic arches are wide, there is a transverse lambdoidal ridge at the rear of the cranium and in some species, a sagittal crest running from front to back. The bony orbits around the eye never form a complete ring and the auditory bullae are smooth and rounded. Females have three to seven pairs of mammae.

All canids are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. The tip of the nose is always naked, as are the cushioned pads on the soles of the feet. These latter consist of a single pad behind the tip of each toe and a more-or-less three-lobed central pad under the roots of the digits. Hairs grow between the pads and in the Arctic fox the sole of the foot is densely covered with hair at some times of the year. With the exception of the four-toed African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;), five toes are on the forefeet, but the pollex (thumb) is reduced and does not reach the ground. On the hind feet are four toes, but in some domestic dogs, a fifth vestigial toe, known as a dewclaw, is sometimes present, but has no anatomical connection to the rest of the foot. In some species, slightly curved nails are non-retractile and more-or-less blunt while other species have sharper, partially-retractile claws.

The canine penis contains a baculum and a structure called the bulbus glandis that expands during copulation, forming a copulatory tie that lasts for up to an hour. Young canids are born blind, with their eyes opening a few weeks after birth. All living canids (Caninae) have a ligament analogous to the nuchal ligament of ungulates used to maintain the posture of the head and neck with little active muscle exertion; this ligament allows them to conserve energy while running long distances following scent trails with their nose to the ground. However, based on skeletal details of the neck, at least some of the Borophaginae (such as &quot;Aelurodon&quot;) are believed to have lacked this ligament.

===Dentition===

Dentition relates to the arrangement of teeth in the mouth, with the dental notation for the upper-jaw teeth using the upper-case letters I to denote incisors, C for canines, P for premolars, and M for molars, and the lower-case letters i, c, p and m to denote the mandible teeth. Teeth are numbered using one side of the mouth and from the front of the mouth to the back. In carnivores, the upper premolar P4 and the lower molar m1 form the carnassials that are used together in a scissor-like action to shear the muscle and tendon of prey.

Canids use their premolars for cutting and crushing except for the upper fourth premolar P4 (the upper carnassial) that is only used for cutting. They use their molars for grinding except for the lower first molar m1 (the lower carnassial) that has evolved for both cutting and grinding depending on the canid&#x27;s dietary adaptation. On the lower carnassial, the trigonid is used for slicing and the talonid is used for grinding. The ratio between the trigonid and the talonid indicates a carnivore&#x27;s dietary habits, with a larger trigonid indicating a hypercarnivore and a larger talonid indicating a more omnivorous diet. Because of its low variability, the length of the lower carnassial is used to provide an estimate of a carnivore&#x27;s body size.

A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for their body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines was greatest in the extinct dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African wild dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator&#x27;s largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits.

Most canids have 42 teeth, with a dental formula of: . The bush dog has only one upper molar with two below, the dhole has two above and two below. and the bat-eared fox has three or four upper molars and four lower ones. The molar teeth are strong in most species, allowing the animals to crack open bone to reach the marrow. The deciduous, or baby teeth, formula in canids is , molars being completely absent.

==Life history==
===Social behavior===
Almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups. In general, they are territorial or have a home range and sleep in the open, using their dens only for breeding and sometimes in bad weather. In most foxes, and in many of the true dogs, a male and female pair work together to hunt and to raise their young. Gray wolves and some of the other larger canids live in larger groups called packs. African wild dogs have packs which may consist of 20 to 40 animals and packs of fewer than about seven individuals may be incapable of successful reproduction. Hunting in packs has the advantage that larger prey items can be tackled. Some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on the circumstances, including the type of available food. In most species, some individuals live on their own. Within a canid pack, there is a system of dominance so that the strongest, most experienced animals lead the pack. In most cases, the dominant male and female are the only pack members to breed.

=== Communication ===
Canids communicate with each other by scent signals, by visual clues and gestures, and by vocalizations such as growls, barks, and howls. In most cases, groups have a home territory from which they drive out other conspecifics. Canids use urine scent marks to mark their food caches or warn trespassing individuals. Social behavior is also mediated by secretions from glands on the upper surface of the tail near its root and from the anal glands, preputial glands, and supracaudal glands.
===Reproduction===

Canids as a group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals as a whole. They are typically monogamous, provide paternal care to their offspring, have reproductive cycles with lengthy proestral and dioestral phases and have a copulatory tie during mating. They also retain adult offspring in the social group, suppressing the ability of these to breed while making use of the alloparental care they can provide to help raise the next generation. Most canid species are spontaneous ovulators, though maned wolves are induced ovulators. 

During the proestral period, increased levels of estradiol make the female attractive to the male. There is a rise in progesterone during the estral phase when female is receptive. Following this, the level of estradiol fluctuates and there is a lengthy dioestrous phase during which the female is pregnant. Pseudo-pregnancy often occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive. A period of anestrus follows pregnancy or pseudo-pregnancy, there being only one oestral period during each breeding season. Small and medium-sized canids mostly have a gestation of 50 to 60 days, while larger species average 60 to 65 days. The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day, as has been shown for several species that have been moved across the equator and experiences a six-month shift of phase. Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more often, perhaps because the photoperiod stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting. Canids have an oestrus period of 1 to 20 days, lasting one week in most species.

The size of a litter varies, with from one to 16 or more pups being born. The young are born small, blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care. They are kept in a den, most often dug into the ground, for warmth and protection. When the young begin eating solid food, both parents, and often other pack members, bring food back for them from the hunt. This is most often vomited up from the adult&#x27;s stomach. Where such pack involvement in the feeding of the litter occurs, the breeding success rate is higher than is the case where females split from the group and rear their pups in isolation. Young canids may take a year to mature and learn the skills they need to survive. In some species, such as the African wild dog, male offspring usually remain in the natal pack, while females disperse as a group and join another small group of the opposite sex to form a new pack.

==Canids and humans==

One canid, the domestic dog, entered into a partnership with humans a long time ago. The dog was the first domesticated species. The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.

The fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been the reason that the relationship developed. Humans benefited from the canid&#x27;s loyalty, cooperation, teamwork, alertness and tracking abilities, while the wolf may have benefited from the use of weapons to tackle larger prey and the sharing of food. Humans and dogs may have evolved together.

Among canids, only the gray wolf has widely been known to prey on humans. Nonetheless, at least two records of coyotes killing humans have been published, and at least two other reports of golden jackals killing children. Human beings have trapped and hunted some canid species for their fur and some, especially the gray wolf, the coyote and the red fox, for sport. Canids such as the dhole are now endangered in the wild because of persecution, habitat loss, a depletion of ungulate prey species and transmission of diseases from domestic dogs.

<text>There are 38 subspecies of &quot;Canis lupus&quot; listed in the taxonomic authority &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (2005, 3rd edition). These subspecies were named over the past 250 years, and since their naming, a number of them have gone extinct. The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus lupus&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; the binomial nomenclature – or the two-word naming – of species. &quot;Canis&quot; is the Latin word meaning &quot;dog&quot;, and under this genus he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as &quot;Canis familiaris&quot;, and on the next page he classified the wolf as &quot;Canis lupus&quot;. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its head, body, and &quot;cauda recurvata&quot; – its upturning tail – which is not found in any other canid.

In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple wolf populations, with the dingo and New Guinea singing dog &quot;breeds&quot; having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other. In the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf &quot;Canis lupus&quot; some 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: &quot;familiaris&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 and &quot;dingo&quot; Meyer, 1793. Wozencraft included &quot;hallstromi&quot; – the New Guinea singing dog – as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 subspecies under the biological common name of &quot;wolf&quot;, with the nominate subspecies being the Eurasian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus lupus&quot;) based on the type specimen that Linnaeus studied in Sweden. However, the classification of several of these canines as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged.

==List of extant subspecies==
Living subspecies recognized by &quot;MSW3&quot; and divided into Old World and New World:

===Eurasia and Australasia===
Sokolov and Rossolimo (1985) recognised nine Old World subspecies of wolf. These were &quot;C. l. lupus&quot;, &quot;C. l. albus&quot;, &quot;C. l. pallipes&quot;, &quot;C. l. cubanensis&quot;, &quot;C. l. campestris&quot;, &quot;C. l. chanco&quot;, &quot;C. l. desortorum&quot;, &quot;C. l. hattai&quot;, and &quot;C. l. hodophilax&quot;. In his 1995 statistical analysis of skull morphometrics, mammalogist Robert Nowak recognized the first four of those subspecies, synonymized &quot;campestris&quot;, &quot;chanco&quot; and &quot;desortorum&quot; with &quot;C. l. lupus&quot;, but did not examine the two Japanese subspecies. In addition, he recognized &quot;C. l. communis&quot; as a subspecies distinct from &quot;C. l. lupus&quot;. In 2003, Nowak also recognized the distinctiveness of &quot;C. l.&quot;, &quot;C. l. hattai&quot;, &quot;C. l. italicus&quot;, and &quot;C. l. hodophilax&quot;. In 2005, &quot;MSW3&quot; included &quot;C. l. filchneri&quot;. In 2003, two forms were distinguished in southern China and Inner Mongolia as being separate from &quot;C. l. chanco&quot; and &quot;C. l. filchneri&quot; and have yet to be named.


===North America===
For North America, in 1944 the zoologist Edward Goldman recognized as many as 23 subspecies based on morphology. In 1959, E. Raymond Hall proposed that there had been 24 subspecies of &quot;lupus&quot; in North America. In 1970, L. David Mech proposed that there was &quot;probably far too many subspecific designations...in use&quot;, as most did not exhibit enough points of differentiation to be classified as separate subspecies. The 24 subspecies were accepted by many authorities in 1981 and these were based on morphological or geographical differences, or a unique history. In 1995, the American mammalogist Robert M. Nowak analyzed data on the skull morphology of wolf specimens from around the world. For North America, he proposed that there were only five subspecies of the wolf. These include a large-toothed Arctic wolf named &quot;C. l. arctos&quot;, a large wolf from Alaska and western Canada named &quot;C. l. occidentalis&quot;, a small wolf from southeastern Canada named &quot;C. l. lycaon&quot;, a small wolf from the southwestern U.S. named &quot;C. l. baileyi&quot; and a moderate-sized wolf that was originally found from Texas to Hudson Bay and from Oregon to Newfoundland named &quot;C. l. nubilus&quot;.

The taxonomic classification of &quot;Canis lupus&quot; in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) listed 27 subspecies of North American wolf, corresponding to the 24 &quot;Canis lupus&quot; subspecies and the three &quot;Canis rufus&quot; subspecies of Hall (1981). The table below shows the extant subspecies, with the extinct ones listed in the following section.

==Disputed subspecies==
===Global===
In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;). In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same &quot;Canis&quot; lineage as modern wolves, and proposed that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog. In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists also considered dingos a feral dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) population.

===Eurasia===
====Italian wolf====

The Italian wolf (or Apennine wolf) was first recognised as a distinct subspecies (&quot;Canis lupus italicus&quot;) in 1921 by zoologist Giuseppe Altobello. Altobello&#x27;s classification was later rejected by several authors, including Reginald Innes Pocock, who synonymised &quot;C. l. italicus&quot; with &quot;C. l. lupus&quot;. In 2002, the noted paleontologist R.M. Nowak reaffirmed the morphological distinctiveness of the Italian wolf and recommended the recognition of &quot;Canis lupus italicus&quot;. A number of DNA studies have found the Italian wolf to be genetically distinct. In 2004, the genetic distinction of the Italian wolf subspecies was supported by analysis which consistently assigned all the wolf genotypes of a sample in Italy to a single group. This population also showed a unique mitochondrial DNA control-region haplotype, the absence of private alleles and lower heterozygosity at microsatellite loci, as compared to other wolf populations. In 2010, a genetic analysis indicated that a single wolf haplotype (w22) unique to the Apennine Peninsula and one of the two haplotypes (w24, w25), unique to the Iberian Peninsula, belonged to the same haplogroup as the prehistoric wolves of Europe. Another haplotype (w10) was found to be common to the Iberian peninsula and the Balkans. These three populations with geographic isolation exhibited a near lack of gene flow and spatially correspond to three glacial refugia.

The taxonomic reference &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) does not recognize &quot;Canis lupus italicus&quot;; however, NCBI/Genbank publishes research papers under that name.

====Iberian wolf====

The Iberian wolf was first recognised as a distinct subspecies (&quot;Canis lupus signatus&quot;) in 1907 by zoologist Ángel Cabrera. The wolves of the Iberian peninsula have morphologically distinct features from other Eurasian wolves and each are considered by their researchers to represent their own subspecies.

The taxonomic reference &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) does not recognize &quot;Canis lupus signatus&quot;; however, NCBI/Genbank does list it.

====Himalayan wolf====

The Himalayan wolf is distinguished by its mitochondrial DNA, which is basal to all other wolves. The taxonomic name of this wolf is disputed, with the species &quot;Canis himalayensis&quot; being proposed based on two limited DNA studies. In 2017, a study of mitochondrial DNA, X-chromosome (maternal lineage) markers and Y-chromosome (male lineage) markers found that the Himalayan wolf was genetically basal to the Holarctic grey wolf and has an association with the African golden wolf.

In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group noted that the Himalayan wolf&#x27;s distribution included the Himalayan range and the Tibetan Plateau. The group recommends that this wolf lineage be known as the &quot;Himalayan wolf&quot; and classified as &quot;Canis lupus chanco&quot; until a genetic analysis of the holotypes is available. In 2020, further research on the Himalayan wolf found that it warranted species-level recognition under the Unified Species Concept, the Differential Fitness Species Concept, and the Biological Species Concept. It was identified as an Evolutionary Significant Unit that warranted assignment onto the IUCN Red List for its protection.

====Indian plains wolf====

The Indian plains wolf is a proposed clade within the Indian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus pallipes&quot;) that is distinguished by its mitochondrial DNA, which is basal to all other wolves except for the Himalayan wolf. The taxonomic status of this wolf clade is disputed, with the separate species &quot;Canis indica&quot; being proposed based on two limited DNA studies. The proposal has not been endorsed because it relied on a limited number of museum and zoo samples that may not have been representative of the wild population, and a call for further fieldwork has been made.

The taxonomic reference &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) does not recognize &quot;Canis indica&quot;; however, NCBI/Genbank lists it as a new subspecies, &quot;Canis lupus indica&quot;.

====Southern Chinese wolf====
In 2017, a comprehensive study found that the gray wolf was present across all of mainland China, both in the past and today. It exists in southern China, which refutes claims made by some researchers in the Western world that the wolf had never existed in southern China. This wolf has not been taxonomically classified.

In 2019, a genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963 and 1988. The wolves in the study formed three clades: northern Asian wolves that included those from northern China and eastern Russia, Himalayan wolves from the Tibetan Plateau, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from Zhejiang Province in eastern China shared gene flow with the wolves from southern China; however, its genome was 12–14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole. The wolf population from southern China is believed to still exist in that region.

===North America===

====Coastal wolves====
A study of the three coastal wolves indicates a close phylogenetic relationship across regions that are geographically and ecologically contiguous, and the study proposed that &quot;Canis lupus ligoni&quot; (the Alexander Archipelago wolf), &quot;Canis lupus columbianus&quot; (the British Columbian wolf), and &quot;Canis lupus crassodon&quot; (the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf) should be recognized as a single subspecies of &quot;Canis lupus&quot;, synonymized as &quot;Canis lupus crassodon&quot;. They share the same habitat and prey species, and form one study&#x27;s six identified North American ecotypes – a genetically and ecologically distinct population separated from other populations by their different types of habitat.

====Eastern wolf====

The eastern wolf has two proposals over its origin. One is that the eastern wolf is a distinct species (&quot;C. lycaon&quot;) that evolved in North America, as opposed to the gray wolf that evolved in the Old World, and is related to the red wolf. The other is that it is derived from admixture between gray wolves, which inhabited the Great Lakes area and coyotes, forming a hybrid that was classified as a distinct species by mistake.

The taxonomic reference &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) does not recognize &quot;Canis lycaon&quot;; however, NCBI/Genbank does list it. In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists also considered &quot;Canis lycaon&quot; a valid species.

====Red wolf====

The red wolf is an enigmatic taxon, of which there are two proposals over its origin. One is that the red wolf is a distinct species (&quot;C. rufus&quot;) that has undergone human-influenced admixture with coyotes. The other is that it was never a distinct species but was derived from past admixture between coyotes and gray wolves, due to the gray wolf population being eliminated by humans.

The taxonomic reference &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (3rd edition, 2005) does not recognize &quot;Canis rufus&quot;; however, NCBI/Genbank does list it. In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists also considered &quot;Canis rufus&quot; a valid species.

<text>Central Asia is a region of Asia consisting of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The countries as a group are also colloquially referred to as the &quot;-stans&quot; as all have names ending with the Persian suffix &quot;-stan&quot; (meaning &#x27;land&#x27;) in both respective native languages and most other languages. The region is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the southwest, European Russia to the northwest, China and Mongolia to the east, Afghanistan and Iran to the south, and Siberia to the north.

In the pre-Islamic and early Islamic eras ( and earlier) Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by Iranian peoples, populated by Eastern Iranian-speaking Bactrians, Sogdians, Chorasmians, and the semi-nomadic Scythians and Dahae. As the result of Turkic migration, Central Asia also became the homeland for the Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, Tatars, Turkmens, Uyghurs, and Uzbeks; Turkic languages largely replaced the Iranian languages spoken in the area, with the exception of Tajikistan and areas where Tajik is spoken.

The Silk Road trade routes crossed through Central Asia, leading to the rise of prosperous trade cities. acting as a crossroads for the movement of people, goods, and ideas between Europe and the Far East. Most countries in Central Asia are still integral to parts of the world economy.

From the mid-19th century until near the end of the 20th century, Central Asia was colonised by the Russians, and incorporated into the Russian Empire, and later the Soviet Union, which led to Russians and other Slavs migrating into the area. Modern-day Central Asia is home to a large population of descendants of European settlers, who mostly live in Kazakhstan: 7 million Russians, 500,000 Ukrainians, and about 170,000 Germans. During the Stalinist period, the forced deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union resulted in a population of over 300,000 Koreans in the region.

Central Asia has a population of about 72 million, in five countries: Kazakhstan ( million), Kyrgyzstan ( million), Tajikistan ( million), Turkmenistan ( million), and Uzbekistan (35million).

== Definitions ==
One of the first geographers to mention Central Asia as a distinct region of the world was Alexander von Humboldt. The borders of Central Asia are subject to multiple definitions. Historically, political geography and culture have been two significant parameters widely used in scholarly definitions of Central Asia. Humboldt&#x27;s definition comprised every country between 5° North and 5° South of the latitude 44.5°N. Humboldt mentions some geographic features of this region, which include the Caspian Sea in the west, the Altai mountains in the north and the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountains in the South. He did not give an eastern border for the region. His legacy is still seen: Humboldt University of Berlin, named after him, offers a course in Central Asian studies. The Russian geographer Nikolaĭ Khanykov questioned the latitudinal definition of Central Asia and preferred a physical one of all countries located in the region landlocked from water, including Afghanistan, Khorasan (Northeast Iran), Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uyghuristan (Xinjiang), Mongolia, and Uzbekistan.


Russian culture has two distinct terms: &quot;Средняя Азия&quot; (&quot;Srednyaya Aziya&quot; or &quot;Middle Asia&quot;, the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and &quot;Центральная Азия&quot; (&quot;Tsentralnaya Aziya&quot; or &quot;Central Asia&quot;, the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia). The latter definition includes Afghanistan and &#x27;East Turkestan&#x27;.

The most limited definition was the official one of the Soviet Union, which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, omitting Kazakhstan. Soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the leaders of the four former Soviet Central Asian Republics met in Tashkent and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.

In 1978, UNESCO defined the region as &quot;Afghanistan, north-eastern Iran, Pakistan, northern India, western China, Mongolia and the Soviet Central Asian Republics&quot;.

An alternative method is to define the region based on ethnicity, and in particular, areas populated by Eastern Turkic, Eastern Iranian, or Mongolian peoples. These areas include Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Turkic regions of southern Siberia, the five republics, and Afghan Turkestan. Afghanistan as a whole, the northern and western areas of Pakistan and the Kashmir Valley of India may also be included. The Tibetans and Ladakhis are also included. Most of the mentioned peoples are considered the &quot;indigenous&quot; peoples of the vast region. Central Asia is sometimes referred to as Turkestan.

== Geography ==

Central Asia is a region of varied geography, including high passes and mountains (Tian Shan), vast deserts (Kyzyl Kum, Taklamakan), and especially treeless, grassy steppes. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of Eastern Europe as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the Eurasian Steppe.

Much of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The Gobi Desert extends from the foot of the Pamirs, 77°E, to the Great Khingan (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116°–118°E.

Central Asia has the following geographic extremes:
* The world&#x27;s northernmost desert (sand dunes), at Buurug Deliin Els, Mongolia, 50°18&#x27;N.
* The Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s southernmost permafrost, at Erdenetsogt sum, Mongolia, 46°17&#x27;N.
* The world&#x27;s shortest distance between non-frozen desert and permafrost: .
* The Eurasian pole of inaccessibility.

A majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region&#x27;s cities.

Major rivers of the region include the Amu Darya, the Syr Darya, Irtysh, the Hari River and the Murghab River. Major bodies of water include the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash, both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian endorheic basin that also includes the Caspian Sea.

Both of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to the diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.
&#x27;

== Historical regions ==

Central Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the Eurasian steppe. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the Oxus and Jaxartes Rivers and along the north flank of the Kopet Dagh near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of Merv and then a few places in Afghanistan like Herat and Balkh. Two projections of the Tian Shan create three &quot;bays&quot; along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called Jetysu or Semirechye which contains Lake Balkhash. In the center is the small but densely-populated Ferghana valley. In the south is Bactria, later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan. The Syr Darya (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the Amu Darya (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the Aral Sea. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called Khwarazm and later the Khanate of Khiva. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important Zarafshan River which waters the great trading cities of Bokhara and Samarkand. The other great commercial city was Tashkent northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called Transoxiana and also Sogdia, especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.

To the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Manchu-Chinese province of Xinjiang (Sinkiang; Hsin-kiang) about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at Kashgar before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.

The Kyzyl Kum Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the Karakum Desert is between the Oxus and Kopet Dagh in Turkmenistan. Khorasan meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. Margiana was the region around Merv. The Ustyurt Plateau is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.

To the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilisation penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilisation in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.

== Climate ==

Because Central Asia is landlocked and not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas, the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the Mediterranean Sea. Average monthly precipitation is very low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the summer in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The last of these represents one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over .

Biogeographically, Central Asia is part of the Palearctic realm. The largest biome in Central Asia is the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. Central Asia also contains the montane grasslands and shrublands, deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate coniferous forests biomes.

=== Climate change ===
As of 2022, there has been a scarcity of research on climate impacts in Central Asia, even though it experiences faster warming than the global average and is generally considered to be one of the more climate-vulnerable regions in the world. Along with West Asia, it has already had greater increases in hot temperature extremes than the other parts of Asia, Rainfall in Central Asia had decreased, unlike elsewhere in Asia, and the frequency and intensity of dust storms had grown (partly due to poor land use practices). Droughts have already become more likely, and their likelihood is expected to continue increasing with greater climate change. By 2050, people in the Amu Darya basin may be faced with severe water scarcity due to both climate and socioeconomic reasons.

== History ==

Although, during the golden age of Orientalism the place of Central Asia in the world history was marginalised, contemporary historiography has rediscovered the &quot;centrality&quot; of the Central Asia. The history of Central Asia is defined by the area&#x27;s climate and geography. The aridness of the region made agriculture difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the steppe.
Relations between the steppe nomads and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to warfare, and the steppe horse riders became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the Silk Road, which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organise several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the Hun invasion of Europe, the Five Barbarians rebellions in China and most notably the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia.

During pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of Iranian languages. Among the ancient sedentary Iranian peoples, the Sogdians and Chorasmians played an important role, while Iranian peoples such as Scythians and the later on Alans lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle.

The main migration of Turkic peoples occurred between the 6th and 11th centuries, when they spread across most of Central Asia. The Eurasian Steppe slowly transitioned from Indo European and Iranian-speaking groups with dominant West-Eurasian ancestry to a more heterogeneous region with increasing East Asian ancestry through Turkic and Mongolian groups in the past thousands years, including extensive Turkic and later Mongol migrations out of Mongolia and slow assimilation of local populations. In the 8th century AD, the Islamic expansion reached the region but had no significant demographic impact. In the 13th century AD, the Mongolian invasion of Central Asia brought most of the region under Mongolian influence, which had &quot;enormous demographic success&quot;, but did not impact the cultural or linguistic landscape.

=== Invasion routes through Central Asia ===

Once populated by Iranian tribes and other Indo-European speaking people, Central Asia experienced numerous invasions emanating out of Southern Siberia and Mongolia that would drastically affect the region. Genetic data shows that the different Central Asian Turkic-speaking peoples have between ~22% and ~70% East Asian ancestry (represented by &quot;Baikal hunter-gatherer ancestry&quot; shared with other Northeast Asians and Eastern Siberians), in contrast to Iranian-speaking Central Asians, specifically Tajiks, which display genetic continuity to Indo-Iranians of the Iron Age. Certain Turkic ethnic groups, specifically the Kazakhs, display even higher East Asian ancestry. This is explained by substantial Mongolian influence on the Kazakh genome, through significant admixture between blue eyes, blonde hair, the medieval Kipchaks of Central Asia and the invading medieval Mongolians. The data suggests that the Mongol invasion of Central Asia had lasting impacts onto the genetic makeup of Kazakhs.

According to recent genetic genealogy testing, the genetic admixture of the Uzbeks clusters somewhere between the Iranian peoples and the Mongols. Another study shows that the Uzbeks are closely related to other Turkic peoples of Central Asia and rather distant from Iranian people. The study also analysed the maternal and paternal DNA haplogroups and shows that Turkic speaking groups are more homogenous than Iranian speaking groups. Genetic studies analyzing the full genome of Uzbeks and other Central Asian populations found that about ~27-60% of the Uzbek ancestry is derived from East Asian sources, with the remainder ancestry (~40–73%) being made up by European and Middle Eastern components. According to a recent study, the Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Turkmens share more of their gene pool with various East Asian and Siberian populations than with West Asian or European populations, though the Turkmens have a large percentage from populations to the east, their main components are Central Asian. The study further suggests that both migration and linguistic assimilation helped to spread the Turkic languages in Eurasia.

=== Medieval to modern history ===

The Tang dynasty of China expanded westwards and controlled large parts of Central Asia, directly and indirectly through their Turkic vassals. Tang China actively supported the Turkification of Central Asia, while extending its cultural influence. The Tang Chinese were defeated by the Abbasid Caliphate at the Battle of Talas in 751, marking the end of the Tang dynasty&#x27;s western expansion and the 150 years of Chinese influence. The Tibetan Empire would take the chance to rule portions of Central Asia and South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Mongols conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history. Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the Chagatai Khanate.

The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as firearms allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. Russia, China, and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Qing dynasty gained control of East Turkestan in the 18th century as a result of a long struggle with the Dzungars. The Russian Empire conquered the lands of the nomadic Kazakhs, Turkmens, Kyrgyz and Central Asian khanates in the 19th century. A major revolt known as the Dungan Revolt occurred in the 1860s and 1870s in the eastern part of Central Asia, and Qing rule almost collapsed in all of East Turkestan. After the Russian Revolution, the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as Xinjiang, was incorporated into the People&#x27;s Republic of China, having been previously ruled by the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China. Mongolia gained its independence from China and has remained independent but became a Soviet satellite state until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the Soviet Union until the Saur Revolution of 1978.

The Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much industrialisation and construction of infrastructure, but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivisation programmes, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems. Soviet authorities deported millions of people, including entire nationalities, from western areas of the Soviet Union to Central Asia and Siberia. According to Touraj Atabaki and Sanjyot Mehendale, &quot;From 1959 to 1970, about two million people from various parts of the Soviet Union migrated to Central Asia, of which about one million moved to Kazakhstan.&quot;

=== After the collapse of the Soviet Union ===
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, five countries gained independence, that is, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The historian and Turkologist Peter B. Golden explains that without the imperial manipulations of the Russian Empire but above all the Soviet Union, the creation of said republics would have been impossible.

In nearly all the new states, former Communist Party officials retained power as local strongmen. None of the new republics could be considered functional democracies in the early days of independence, although in recent years Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia have made further progress towards more open societies, unlike Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, which have maintained many Soviet-style repressive tactics.

Beginning in the early 2000s, the Chinese government engaged in a series of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang.

== Culture ==
=== Arts ===
At the crossroads of Asia, shamanistic practices live alongside Buddhism. Thus, Yama, Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The Qianlong Emperor of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from Beijing to other cities for personal religious worship.

Central Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational oral poetry that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by &quot;akyns&quot;, lyrical improvisationalists. They engage in lyrical battles, the &quot;aytysh&quot; or the &quot;alym sabak&quot;. The tradition arose out of early bardic oral historians. They are usually accompanied by a stringed instrument—in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed komuz, and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.

Photography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a Russian Mennonite photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the Khanate of Khiva during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by Claas Epp, Jr. Upon his arrival to Khanate of Khiva, Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of Uzbek photography.

Some also learn to sing the &quot;Manas&quot;, Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s epic poem (those who learn the &quot;Manas&quot; exclusively but do not improvise are called &quot;manaschis&quot;). During Soviet rule, &quot;akyn&quot; performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although &quot;akyns&quot; still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of &quot;akyns&quot; and modern freestyle rap performed in the West.

As a consequence of Russian colonisation, European fine arts – painting, sculpture and graphics – have developed in Central Asia. The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organisations. The years of 1990–2000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organised since 2005.

=== Sports ===
Equestrian sports are traditional in Central Asia, with disciplines like endurance riding, buzkashi, dzhigit and kyz kuu.

The traditional game of Buzkashi is played throughout the Central Asian region, the countries sometimes organise Buzkashi competition amongst each other. The First regional competition among the Central Asian countries, Russia, Chinese Xinjiang and Turkey was held in 2013. The first world title competition was played in 2017 and won by Kazakhstan.

Association football is popular across Central Asia. Most countries are members of the Central Asian Football Association, a region of the Asian Football Confederation. However, Kazakhstan is a member of the UEFA.

Wrestling is popular across Central Asia, with Kazakhstan having claimed 14 Olympic medals, Uzbekistan seven, and Kyrgyzstan three. As former Soviet states, Central Asian countries have been successful in gymnastics.

Mixed Martial Arts is one of more common sports in Central Asia, Kyrgyz athlete Valentina Shevchenko holding the UFC Flyweight Champion title.

Cricket is the most popular sport in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan national cricket team, first formed in 2001, has claimed wins over Bangladesh, West Indies and Zimbabwe.

Notable Kazakh competitors include cyclists Alexander Vinokourov and Andrey Kashechkin, boxer Vassiliy Jirov and Gennady Golovkin, runner Olga Shishigina, decathlete Dmitriy Karpov, gymnast Aliya Yussupova, judoka Askhat Zhitkeyev and Maxim Rakov, skier Vladimir Smirnov, weightlifter Ilya Ilyin, and figure skaters Denis Ten and Elizabet Tursynbaeva.

Notable Uzbekistani competitors include cyclist Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, boxer Ruslan Chagaev, canoer Michael Kolganov, gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, tennis player Denis Istomin, chess player Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and figure skater Misha Ge.

== Economy ==

Since gaining independence in the early 1990s, the Central Asian republics have gradually been moving from a state-controlled economy to a market economy. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. Kazakhstan is the only CIS country to be included in the 2020 and 2019 IWB World Competitiveness rankings. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry decreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.

Public policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.

The republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan&#x27;s own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world&#x27;s largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports − the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country&#x27;s primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government&#x27;s intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.

Although both exports and imports have grown significantly over the past decade, Central Asian republics countries remain vulnerable to economic shocks, owing to their reliance on exports of raw materials, a restricted circle of trading partners and a negligible manufacturing capacity. Kyrgyzstan has the added disadvantage of being considered resource poor, although it does have ample water. Most of its electricity is generated by hydropower.

The Kyrgyz economy was shaken by a series of shocks between 2010 and 2012. In April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed by a popular uprising, with former minister of foreign affairs Roza Otunbayeva assuring the interim presidency until the election of Almazbek Atambayev in November 2011. Food prices rose two years in a row and, in 2012, production at the major Kumtor gold mine fell by 60% after the site was perturbed by geological movements. According to the World Bank, 33.7% of the population was living in absolute poverty in 2010 and 36.8% a year later.

Despite high rates of economic growth in recent years, GDP per capita in Central Asia was higher than the average for developing countries only in Kazakhstan in 2013 (PPP$23,206) and Turkmenistan (PPP$14 201). It dropped to PPP$5,167 for Uzbekistan, home to 45% of the region&#x27;s population, and was even lower for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

Kazakhstan leads the Central Asian region in terms of foreign direct investments. The Kazakh economy accounts for more than 70% of all the investment attracted in Central Asia.

In terms of the economic influence of big powers, China is viewed as one of the key economic players in Central Asia, especially after Beijing launched its grand development strategy known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013.

The Central Asian countries attracted $378.2billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) between 2007 and 2019. Kazakhstan accounted for 77.7% of the total FDI directed to the region. Kazakhstan is also the largest country in Central Asia accounting for more than 60 percent of the region&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP).

Central Asian nations fared better economically throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Many variables are likely to have been at play, but disparities in economic structure, the intensity of the pandemic, and accompanying containment efforts may all be linked to part of the variety in nations&#x27; experiences. Central Asian countries are, however, predicted to be hit the worst in the future. Only 4% of permanently closed businesses anticipate to return in the future, with huge differences across sectors, ranging from 3% in lodging and food services to 27% in retail commerce.

In 2022, experts assessed that global climate change is likely to pose multiple economic risks to Central Asia and may possibly result in many billions of losses unless proper adaptation measures are developed to counter growing temperatures across the region.

== Education, science and technology ==
=== Modernisation of research infrastructure ===
Bolstered by strong economic growth in all but Kyrgyzstan, national development strategies are fostering new high-tech industries, pooling resources and orienting the economy towards export markets. Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the Turkmen Academy of Sciences&#x27;s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the Institute of Solar Energy; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics. In Uzbekistan, more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganised, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the National University of Uzbekistan and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within Samarkand State University. Other research institutions have remained attached to the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, such as the Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics.

Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernise infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialisation has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialisation of research results and technology.

Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the Asian Development Bank and other institutions: the SPU Physical−Technical Institute (Physics Sun Institute) and the International Solar Energy Institute. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, Inha University in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the International Oil and Gas University in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the Bologna Process, which seeks to harmonise higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.

=== Financial investment in research ===
The Central Asian republics&#x27; ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region&#x27;s investment in research and development hovered around 0.2–0.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.

Kazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development – but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country&#x27;s manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.
=== Trends in researchers ===
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan count the highest researcher density in Central Asia. The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).

Kazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan&#x27;s research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree.

Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45–55% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law&#x27;s impact on research. As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.

=== Research output ===

The number of scientific papers published in Central Asia grew by almost 50% between 2005 and 2014, driven by Kazakhstan, which overtook Uzbekistan over this period to become the region&#x27;s most prolific scientific publisher, according to Thomson Reuters&#x27; Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Between 2005 and 2014, Kazakhstan&#x27;s share of scientific papers from the region grew from 35% to 56%. Although two-thirds of papers from the region have a foreign co-author, the main partners tend to come from beyond Central Asia, namely the Russian Federation, USA, German, United Kingdom and Japan.

Five Kazakh patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2008 and 2013, compared to three for Uzbek inventors and none at all for the other three Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Kazakhstan is Central Asia&#x27;s main trader in high-tech products. Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7billion to US$5.1billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744million in 2008 and US$2.6billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual – from US$2.3billion to US$3.1billion – and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5billion) and 83% (US$2.6billion) in 2013.

=== International cooperation ===
The five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. They are also members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the &quot;CAREC 2020 Strategy&quot;, a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members&#x27; competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan border the Caspian Sea and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.

Kazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.

Kazakhstan and Tajikistan participated in the Innovative Biotechnologies Programme (2011–2015) launched by the Eurasian Economic Community, the predecessor of the Eurasian Economic Union, The programme also involved Belarus and the Russian Federation. Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organisations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, scientific director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. &quot;In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources&quot;, he said. &quot;Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.&quot;

Kazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3–90million and is implemented within a public–private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries. Kazakhstan recognises the role civil society initiatives have to address the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.

Four of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage Central Asian countries to participate in research projects within Horizon 2020, the European Union&#x27;s eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions – universities, companies and research institutes – for funding of up to €10, 000 to enable them to visit one another&#x27;s facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.

The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.

Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have been members of the World Trade Organization since 1998, 2013 and 2015 respectively.

== Territorial and regional data ==
== Demographics ==

By a broad definition including Mongolia and Afghanistan, more than 90 million people live in Central Asia, about 2% of Asia&#x27;s total population. Of the regions of Asia, only North Asia has fewer people. It has a population density of 9 people per km2, vastly less than the 80.5 people per km2 of the continent as a whole. Kazakhstan is one of the least densely populated countries in the world.

=== Languages ===
Russian, as well as being spoken by around six million ethnic Russians and Ukrainians of Central Asia, is the de facto lingua franca throughout the former Soviet Central Asian Republics. Mandarin Chinese has an equally dominant presence in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Xinjiang.

The languages of the majority of the inhabitants of the former Soviet Central Asian Republics belong to the Turkic language group. Turkmen is mainly spoken in Turkmenistan, and as a minority language in Afghanistan, Russia, Iran and Turkey. Kazakh and Kyrgyz are related languages of the Kypchak group of Turkic languages and are spoken throughout Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and as a minority language in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Xinjiang. Uzbek and Uyghur are spoken in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Xinjiang.

Middle Iranian languages were once spoken throughout Central Asia, such as the once prominent Sogdian, Khwarezmian, Bactrian and Scythian, which are now extinct and belonged to the Eastern Iranian family. The Eastern Iranian Pashto language is still spoken in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. Other minor Eastern Iranian languages such as Shughni, Munji, Ishkashimi, Sarikoli, Wakhi, Yaghnobi and Ossetic are also spoken at various places in Central Asia. Varieties of Persian are also spoken as a major language in the region, locally known as Dari (in Afghanistan), Tajik (in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), and Bukhori (by the Bukharan Jews of Central Asia).

Tocharian, another Indo-European language group, which was once predominant in oases on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, is now extinct.

Other language groups include the Tibetic languages, spoken by around six million people across the Tibetan Plateau and into Qinghai, Sichuan (Szechwan), Ladakh and Baltistan, and the Nuristani languages of northeastern Afghanistan. Korean is spoken by the Koryo-saram minority, mainly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

=== Religions ===
Islam is the religion most common in the Central Asian Republics, Afghanistan, Xinjiang, and the peripheral western regions, such as Bashkortostan. Most Central Asian Muslims are Sunni, although there are sizable Shia minorities in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

Buddhism and Zoroastrianism were the major faiths in Central Asia before the arrival of Islam. Zoroastrian influence is still felt today in such celebrations as Nowruz, held in all five of the Central Asian states. The transmission of Buddhism along the Silk Road eventually brought the religion to China. Amongst the Turkic peoples, Tengrism was the leading religion before Islam. Tibetan Buddhism is most common in Tibet, Mongolia, Ladakh, and the southern Russian regions of Siberia.

The form of Christianity most practiced in the region in previous centuries was Nestorianism, but now the largest denomination is the Russian Orthodox Church, with many members in Kazakhstan, where about 25% of the population of 19 million identify as Christian, 17% in Uzbekistan and 5% in Kyrgyzstan. Pew Research Center estimates indicate that in 2010, around 6 million Christians lived in Central Asian countries, the Pew Forum study finds that Kazakhstan (4.1 million) has the largest Christian population in the region, followed by Uzbekistan (710,000), Kyrgyzstan (660,000), Turkmenistan (320,000) and Tajikistan (100,000).

The Bukharan Jews were once a sizable community in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, but nearly all have emigrated since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

In Siberia, shaministic practices persist, including forms of divination such as Kumalak.

Contact and migration with Han people from China has brought Confucianism, Daoism, Mahayana Buddhism, and other Chinese folk beliefs into the region.

Central Asia is where many integral beliefs and elements in various religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism.

== Geostrategy ==

Central Asia has long been a strategic location merely because of its proximity to several great powers on the Eurasian landmass. The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.

Central Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.
* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.
* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the Silk Road period of Han dynasty. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.
* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the Hindu Kush, and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the British Empire competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.
* To the Southwest, West Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great&#x27;s Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common Turkic nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the Turkic Council.

In the post–Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:
* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia&#x27;s influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region&#x27;s politics. The United States and other NATO members were the main contributors to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan during the Islamic Republic period and also exert considerable influence in other Central Asian nations.
* China has security ties with Central Asian states through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and conducts energy trade bilaterally.
* India has geographic proximity to the Central Asian region and, in addition, enjoys considerable influence on Afghanistan. India maintains a military base at Farkhor, Tajikistan, and also has extensive military relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
* Turkey also exerts considerable influence in the region on account of its ethnic and linguistic ties with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and its involvement in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. Political and economic relations are growing rapidly (e.g., Turkey recently eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the Central Asian Turkic republics).
* Iran, the seat of historical empires that controlled parts of Central Asia, has historical and cultural links to the region and is vying to construct an oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
* Pakistan, a nuclear-armed Islamic state, has a history of political relations with neighbouring Afghanistan and is termed capable of exercising influence. For some Central Asian nations, the shortest route to the ocean lies through Pakistan. Pakistan seeks natural gas from Central Asia and supports the development of pipelines from its countries. According to an independent study, Turkmenistan is supposed to be the fifth largest natural gas field in the world. The mountain ranges and areas in northern Pakistan lie on the fringes of Greater Central Asia; the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan lies adjacent to Tajikistan, separated only by the narrow Afghan Wakhan Corridor. Being located on the northwest of South Asia, the area forming modern-day Pakistan maintained extensive historical and cultural links with the central Asian region.
* Japan has an important and growing influence in Central Asia, with the master plan of the capital city of Astana in Kazakhstan being designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa, and the Central Asia plus Japan initiative designed to strengthen ties between them and promote development and stability of the region.

Russian historian Lev Gumilev wrote that Xiongnu, Mongols (Mongol Empire, Zunghar Khanate) and Turkic peoples (First Turkic Khaganate, Uyghur Khaganate) played a role to stop Chinese aggression to the north. The Turkic Khaganate had special policy against Chinese assimilation policy.

The region, along with Russia, is also part of &quot;the great pivot&quot; as per the Heartland Theory of Halford Mackinder, which says that the power which controls Central Asia—richly endowed with natural resources—shall ultimately be the &quot;empire of the world&quot;. For example, the region is endowed with various mineral resources such as chromium, cobalt, zinc, copper, silver, lithium, lead, molybdenum and many others making it a potential major global supplier of critical materials for clean energy technologies.

=== War on Terror ===
In the context of the United States&#x27; War on Terror, Central Asia has once again become the center of geostrategic calculations. Pakistan&#x27;s status has been upgraded by the U.S. government to Major non-NATO ally because of its central role in serving as a staging point for the invasion of Afghanistan, providing intelligence on Al-Qaeda operations in the region, and leading the hunt on Osama bin Laden.

Afghanistan, which had served as a haven and source of support for Al-Qaeda under the protection of Mullah Omar and the Taliban, was the target of a U.S. invasion in 2001 and ongoing reconstruction and drug-eradication efforts. U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.

Western governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.

<doc id="6745" wikidata="Q76605" url="?curid=6745" title="Couscous">
<text>Couscous () is a traditional North African dish of small steamed granules of rolled semolina that is often served with a stew spooned on top. Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.

Couscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya. It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century, through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.

In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;couscous&quot; (alternately &quot;cuscus&quot; or &quot;kuskus&quot;) was first noted in early 17th century French, from Arabic kuskus, from kaskasa &#x27;to pound&#x27;, and is probably of Berber origin. The term &quot;seksu&quot; is attested in various Berber dialects such as Kabyle and Rifain, while Saharan Berber dialects such as Touareg and Ghadames have a slightly different form, &quot;keskesu.&quot; This widespread geographical dispersion of the term strongly suggests its local Berber origin, lending further support to its likely Berber roots as Algerian linguist Salem Chaker suggests.

The Berber root *KS means &quot;well formed, well rolled, rounded.&quot; Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world.

== History ==

It is unclear when couscous originated. Food historian Lucie Bolens believes couscous originated millennia ago, during the reign of Masinissa in the ancient kingdom of Numidia in present-day Algeria. Traces of cooking vessels akin to couscoussiers have been found in graves from the 3rd century BC, from the time of the berber kings of Numidia, in the city of Tiaret, Algeria. Couscoussiers dating back to the 12th century were found in the ruins of Igiliz, located in the Sous valley of Morocco.

According to food writer Charles Perry, couscous originated among the Berbers of Algeria and Morocco between the end of the 11th-century Zirid dynasty, modern-day Algeria, and the rise of the 13th-century Almohad Caliphate. The historian Hady Idris noted that couscous is attested to during the Hafsid dynasty, but not the Zirid dynasty.

In the 12th century, Maghrebi cooks were preparing dishes of non-mushy grains by stirring flour with water to create light, round balls of couscous dough that could be steamed.

The historian Maxime Rodinson found three recipes for couscous from the 13th century Arabic cookbook &quot;Kitab al-Wusla ila al-Habib&quot;, written by an Ayyubid author, and the anonymous Arabic cooking book &quot;Kitab al tabikh&quot; and Ibn Razin al-Tujibi&#x27;s &quot;Fadalat al-khiwan&quot; also contain recipes.

Couscous is believed to have been spread among the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula by the Berber dynasties of the 13th century, though it is no longer found in traditional Spanish or Portuguese cuisine. In modern-day Trapani, Sicily, the dish is still made to the medieval recipe of Andalusian author Ibn Razin al-Tujibi. Ligurian families that moved from Tabarka to Sardinia brought the dish with them to Carloforte in the 18th century.

Known in France since the 16th century, it was brought into French cuisine at the beginning of the 20th century via the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs.

== Preparation ==

Couscous is traditionally made from semolina, the hardest part of the grain of durum wheat (the hardest of all forms of wheat), which resists the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished, granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny couscous granules. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of people come together to make large batches over several days, which are then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.

In some regions, couscous is made from farina or coarsely ground barley or pearl millet.
In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold worldwide. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid. Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty.

Traditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called a &quot;taseksut&quot; in the Berber language, a &quot;kiskas&quot; in Arabic or a &quot;couscoussier&quot; in French language). The base is a tall metal pot shaped like an oil jar, where the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The steamer&#x27;s lid has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth.

The couscous that is sold in most Western grocery stores is usually pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous and then leaving it covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice). Packaged sets of quick-preparation couscous and canned vegetables, and generally meat, are routinely sold in European grocery stores and supermarkets. Couscous is widely consumed in France, where it was introduced by Maghreb immigrants and voted the third most popular dish in a 2011 survey.

== Recognition ==
In December 2020, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia obtained official recognition for the knowledge, know-how, and practices pertaining to the production and consumption of couscous on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The joint submission by the four countries was hailed as an &quot;example of international cooperation.&quot;

== Local variations ==

Couscous proper is about 2 mm in diameter, but there also exists a larger variety (3 mm more) known as &quot;berkoukes&quot;, as well as an ultra-fine version (around 1 mm). In Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, it is generally served with vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and turnips) cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, usually with some meat (generally, chicken, lamb, or mutton).

=== Algeria ===

Algerian couscous is a traditional staple food in Algeria, and it plays an important role in Algerian culture and cuisine. It is commonly served with vegetables, meat, or fish. In Algeria, there are various types of couscous dishes.

=== Tunisia ===

In Tunisia, couscous is usually spicy, made with harissa sauce, and served commonly with vegetables and meat, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef, and sometimes (in southern regions) camel. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus, squid or other seafood in a hot, red, spicy sauce.
Couscous can also be served as a dessert. It is then called Masfuf. Masfuf can also contain raisins, grapes, or pomegranate seeds.

=== Libya ===
In Libya, couscous is mostly served with lamb (but sometimes camel meat or, rarely, beef) in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey and is locally referred to as &quot;maghrood&quot;.

=== Malta ===
In Malta, small round pasta slightly larger than typical couscous is known as &quot;kusksu&quot;. It is commonly used in a dish of the same name, which includes broad beans (known in Maltese as &quot;ful&quot;) and &quot;ġbejniet&quot;, a local type of cheese.

=== Mauritania ===
In Mauritania, the couscous uses large wheat grains (&quot;mabroum&quot;) and is darker than the yellow couscous of Morocco. It is cooked with lamb, beef, or camel meat together with vegetables, primarily onion, tomato, and carrots, then mixed with a sauce and served with ghee, locally known as &quot;dhen&quot;.

== Similar foods ==
Couscous is made from crushed wheat flour rolled into its constituent granules or pearls, making it distinct from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, which is made from ground wheat and either molded or extruded. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined.

Several dishes worldwide are also made from granules, like those of couscous rolled from flour from grains or other milled or grated starchy crops.
* Attiéké, a staple food in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and surrounding regions of West Africa, is made from granulated grated cassava.
* Cuscuz () is a couscous-like dish from the Northeast Region of Brazil. It is made out of cornmeal and eaten hot with meat and cold with milk. In the state of São Paulo, a speciality known as , is made with cornmeal, tomato sauce, tomato pieces, olive oil, boiled egg and other ingredients, such as peas, sweetcorn, hearts of palm and sardines. It is also possible to find the dish made with shredded chicken, tuna or shrimp. All the ingredients are cooked in a pan and then placed and left to set in a mould with a hole in the middle. The Mould is then inverted onto a serving dish.
* Dambou is a couscous-like dish from Niger. It may be made from semolina for special occasions but is often made with rice, millet, or other grain. Moringa leaves are traditionally included in the dish. In France, this Nigerien dish has been adapted as a specific variant (called &quot;couscous aux épinards&quot;) of the Maghreb-syle couscous commonly found there, often using spinach in place of the moringa.
* Fregula is a type of pasta from Sardinia. It is similar to North African Berkoukes and Middle Eastern Moghrabieh. Fregula comes in varying sizes but typically consists of semolina dough rolled into balls 2–3 mm in diameter and toasted in an oven.
* Kouskousaki (Κουσκουσάκι (in Greek) or &quot;kuskus&quot; (in Turkish) is a pasta from Greece and Turkey, that is boiled and served with cheese and walnuts.

* In the Levant, the dish known as moghrabieh (a reference to the Maghreb region) uses the same durum-based semolina flour but rolled into larger ( in diameter) &#x27;pearls&#x27; to create a dish that is popular across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The pearls are either cooked as part of a stew or flavored with cinnamon and served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth.
*Palestinian &quot;maftoul&quot; uses granules that are larger than the North African variety but smaller than moghrabieh pearls ( in diameter) and made with bulgur or Simolina, or a mix of both. It is similarly served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth. &quot;Maftoul&quot; is an Arabic word derived from the root &quot;fa-ta-la,&quot; which means to roll or to twist, describing the hand-rolling method used to make the granules.
* Wusu-Wusu is a couscous that is prepared out of fonio in the Hausa region of Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana.

<doc id="6746" wikidata="Q46418" url="?curid=6746" title="Constantius II">
<text>Constantius II (; ; 7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was Roman emperor from 337 to 361. His reign saw constant warfare on the borders against the Sasanian Empire and Germanic peoples, while internally the Roman Empire went through repeated civil wars, court intrigues, and usurpations. His religious policies inflamed domestic conflicts that would continue after his death.

Constantius was a son of Constantine the Great, who elevated him to the imperial rank of &quot;Caesar&quot; on 8 November 324 and after whose death Constantius became &quot;Augustus&quot; together with his brothers, Constantine II and Constans on 9 September 337. He promptly oversaw the massacre of his father-in-law, an uncle, and several cousins, consolidating his hold on power. The brothers divided the empire among themselves, with Constantius receiving Greece, Thrace, the Asian provinces, and Egypt in the east. For the following decade a costly and inconclusive war against Persia took most of Constantius&#x27;s time and attention. In the meantime, his brothers Constantine and Constans warred over the western provinces of the empire, leaving the former dead in 340 and the latter as sole ruler of the west. The two remaining brothers maintained an uneasy peace with each other until, in 350, Constans was overthrown and assassinated by the usurper Magnentius.

Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius waged a civil war against the usurper, defeating him at the battles of Mursa Major in 351 and Mons Seleucus in 353. Magnentius died by suicide after the latter battle, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire. In 351, Constantius elevated his cousin Constantius Gallus to the subordinate rank of &quot;Caesar&quot; to rule in the east, but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus&#x27;s younger half-brother Julian, to the rank of &quot;Caesar&quot;.

As emperor, Constantius promoted Arianism, banned pagan sacrifices, and issued laws against Jews. His military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the Alamanni in 354 and campaigned across the Danube against the Quadi and Sarmatians in 357. The war against the Sasanians, which had been in a lull since 350, erupted with renewed intensity in 359 and Constantius travelled to the east in 360 to restore stability after the loss of several border fortresses. However, Julian claimed the rank of &quot;Augustus&quot; in 360, leading to war between the two after Constantius&#x27;s attempts to persuade Julian to back down failed. No battle was fought, as Constantius became ill and died of fever on 3 November 361 in Mopsuestia, allegedly naming Julian as his rightful successor before his death.

==Early life==
Flavius Julius Constantius was born in 317 at Sirmium, Pannonia, now Serbia. He was the third son of Constantine the Great, and second by his second wife Fausta, the daughter of Maximian. Constantius was made &quot;caesar&quot; by his father on 8 November 324. In 336, religious unrest in Armenia and tense relations between Constantine and king Shapur II caused war to break out between Rome and Sassanid Persia. Though he made initial preparations for the war, Constantine fell ill and sent Constantius east to take command of the eastern frontier. Before Constantius arrived, the Persian general Narses, who was possibly the king&#x27;s brother, overran Mesopotamia and captured Amida. Constantius promptly attacked Narses, and after suffering minor setbacks defeated and killed Narses at the Battle of Narasara. Constantius captured Amida and initiated a major refortification of the city, enhancing the city&#x27;s circuit walls and constructing large towers. He also built a new stronghold in the hinterland nearby, naming it &quot;Antinopolis&quot;.

== Augustus in the East ==

In early 337, Constantius hurried to Constantinople after receiving news that his father was near death. After Constantine died, Constantius buried him with lavish ceremony in the Church of the Holy Apostles. Soon after his father&#x27;s death, the army massacred his relatives descended from the marriage of his paternal grandfather Constantius Chlorus to Flavia Maximiana Theodora, though the details are unclear. Two of Constantius&#x27;s uncles (Julius Constantius and Flavius Dalmatius) and seven of his cousins were killed, including Hannibalianus and Dalmatius, rulers of Pontus and Moesia respectively, leaving Constantius, his two brothers Constantine II and Constans, and three cousins Gallus, Julian and Nepotianus as the only surviving male relatives of Constantine the Great. While the “official version” was that Constantius&#x27;s relatives were merely the victims of a mutinous army, Ammianus Marcellinus, Zosimus, Libanius, Athanasius and Julian all blamed Constantius for the event. Burgess considered the latter version to be “consistent with all the evidence,” pointing to multiple factors that he believed lined up with the massacre being a planned attack rather than a spontaneous mutiny - the lack of high-profile punishments as a response, the sparing of all women, the attempted damnatio memoriae on the deceased, and the exile of the survivors Gallus and Julian.

Soon after, Constantius met his brothers in Pannonia at Sirmium to formalize the partition of the empire. Constantius received the eastern provinces, including Constantinople, Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, and Cyrenaica; Constantine received Britannia, Gaul, Hispania, and Mauretania; and Constans, initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received Italy, Africa, Illyricum, Pannonia, Macedonia, and Achaea.

Constantius then hurried east to Antioch to resume the war with Persia. While Constantius was away from the eastern frontier in early 337, King Shapur II assembled a large army, which included war elephants, and launched an attack on Roman territory, laying waste to Mesopotamia and putting the city of Nisibis under siege. Despite initial success, Shapur lifted his siege after his army missed an opportunity to exploit a collapsed wall. When Constantius learned of Shapur&#x27;s withdrawal from Roman territory, he prepared his army for a counter-attack.

Constantius repeatedly defended the eastern border against invasions by the Sassanid Empire under Shapur. These conflicts were mainly limited to Sassanid sieges of the major fortresses of Roman Mesopotamia, including Nisibis (Nusaybin), Singara, and Amida (Diyarbakir). Although Shapur seems to have been victorious in most of these confrontations, the Sassanids were able to achieve little. However, the Romans won a decisive victory at the Battle of Narasara, killing Shapur&#x27;s brother, Narses. Ultimately, Constantius was able to push back the invasion, and Shapur failed to make any significant gains.

Meanwhile, Constantine II desired to retain control of Constans&#x27;s realm, leading the brothers into open conflict. Constantine was killed in 340 near Aquileia during an ambush. As a result, Constans took control of his deceased brother&#x27;s realms and became sole ruler of the Western two-thirds of the empire. This division lasted until January 350, when Constans was assassinated by forces loyal to the usurper Magnentius.

===War against Magnentius===

Constantius was determined to march west to fight the usurper. However, feeling that the east still required some sort of imperial presence, he elevated his cousin Constantius Gallus to &quot;caesar&quot; of the eastern provinces. As an extra measure to ensure the loyalty of his cousin, he married the elder of his two sisters, Constantina, to him.

Before facing Magnentius, Constantius first came to terms with Vetranio, a loyal general in Illyricum who had recently been acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support. These events may have been spurred by the action of Constantina, who had since traveled east to marry Gallus. Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general&#x27;s new position as &quot;augustus&quot;. However, when Constantius arrived, Vetranio willingly resigned his position and accepted Constantius&#x27;s offer of a comfortable retirement in Bithynia.

In 351, Constantius clashed with Magnentius in Pannonia with a large army. The ensuing Battle of Mursa Major was one of the largest and bloodiest battles ever between two Roman armies. The result was a victory for Constantius, but a costly one. Magnentius survived the battle and, determined to fight on, withdrew into northern Italy. Rather than pursuing his opponent, however, Constantius turned his attention to securing the Danubian border, where he spent the early months of 352 campaigning against the Sarmatians along the middle Danube. After achieving his aims, Constantius advanced on Magnentius in Italy. This action led the cities of Italy to switch their allegiance to him and eject the usurper&#x27;s garrisons. Again, Magnentius withdrew, this time to southern Gaul.

In 353, Constantius and Magnentius met for the final time at the Battle of Mons Seleucus in southern Gaul, and again Constantius emerged the victor. Magnentius, realizing the futility of continuing his position, committed suicide on 10 August 353.

== Solo reign ==

Constantius spent much of the rest of 353 and early 354 on campaign against the Alamanni on the Danube frontier. The campaign was successful and raiding by the Alamanni ceased temporarily. In the meantime, Constantius had been receiving disturbing reports regarding the actions of his cousin Gallus. Possibly as a result of these reports, Constantius concluded a peace with the Alamanni and traveled to Mediolanum (Milan).

In Mediolanum, Constantius first summoned Ursicinus, Gallus&#x27;s &quot;magister equitum&quot;, for reasons that remain unclear. Constantius then summoned Gallus and Constantina. Although Gallus and Constantina complied with the order at first, when Constantina died in Bithynia, Gallus began to hesitate. However, after some convincing by one of Constantius&#x27;s agents, Gallus continued his journey west, passing through Constantinople and Thrace to Poetovio (Ptuj) in Pannonia.

In Poetovio, Gallus was arrested by the soldiers of Constantius under the command of Barbatio. Gallus was then moved to Pola and interrogated. Gallus claimed that it was Constantina who was to blame for all the trouble while he was in charge of the eastern provinces. This angered Constantius so greatly that he immediately ordered Gallus&#x27;s execution. He soon changed his mind, however, and recanted the order. Unfortunately for Gallus, this second order was delayed by Eusebius, one of Constantius&#x27;s eunuchs, and Gallus was executed.

===Religious issues===

====Paganism====
Laws dating from the 350s prescribed the death penalty for those who performed or attended pagan sacrifices, and for the worshipping of idols. Pagan temples were shut down, and the Altar of Victory was removed from the Senate meeting house. There were also frequent episodes of ordinary Christians destroying, pillaging and desecrating many ancient pagan temples, tombs and monuments.
Paganism was still popular among the population at the time. The emperor&#x27;s policies were passively resisted by many governors and magistrates.

In spite of this, Constantius never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the Vestal Virgins. He never acted against the various pagan schools. At times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa. Also, he remained pontifex maximus and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. His relative moderation toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was over twenty years after his death, during the reign of Gratian, that any pagan senator protested his treatment of their religion.

====Christianity====
Although often considered an Arian, Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between Arianism and the Nicene Creed, retrospectively called Semi-Arianism. During his reign he attempted to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, convening several Christian councils. &quot;Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious,&quot; writes the historian A. H. M. Jones. &quot;The great councils of 359–60 are therefore not reckoned ecumenical in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a heretic who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church.&quot;

According to the Greek historian Philostorgius (d. 439) in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Constantius sent an Arian bishop known as Theophilus the Indian (also known as &quot;Theophilus of Yemen&quot;) to Tharan Yuhanim, then the king of the South Arabian Himyarite Kingdom to convert the people to Christianity. According to the report, Theophilus succeeded in establishing three churches, one of them in the capital Zafar.

====Judaism====
Judaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father. This included edicts to limit the ownership of slaves by Jewish people and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women. Later edicts sought to discourage conversions from Christianity to Judaism by confiscating the apostate&#x27;s property. However, Constantius&#x27;s actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as with Jewish business—apparently, privately owned Jewish businesses were often in competition with state-owned businesses. As a result, Constantius may have sought to provide an advantage to state-owned businesses by limiting the skilled workers and slaves available to Jewish businesses.

===Further crises===
On 11 August 355, the &quot;magister militum&quot; Claudius Silvanus revolted in Gaul. Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the Battle of Mursa Major. Constantius had made him &quot;magister militum&quot; in 353 with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius&#x27;s court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter from Constantius recalling him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. Ursicinus, who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.

Constantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, however, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself. So on 6 November 355, he elevated his last remaining male relative, Julian, to the rank of &quot;caesar&quot;. A few days later, Julian was married to Helena, the last surviving sister of Constantius. Constantius soon sent Julian off to Gaul.

Constantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In April–May 357 he visited Rome for the only time in his life. The same year, he forced Sarmatian and Quadi invaders out of Pannonia and Moesia Inferior, then led a successful counter-attack across the Danube.

In the winter of 357–58, Constantius received ambassadors from Shapur II who demanded that Rome restore the lands surrendered by Narseh. Despite rejecting these terms, Constantius tried to avert war with the Sassanid Empire by sending two embassies to Shapur II. Shapur II nevertheless launched another invasion of Roman Mesopotamia. In 360, when news reached Constantius that Shapur II had destroyed Singara (Sinjar), and taken Kiphas (Hasankeyf), Amida (Diyarbakır), and Ad Tigris (Cizre), he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.

===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===

In the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the Alamanni, who had once again invaded Roman Gaul. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian&#x27;s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian &quot;augustus&quot;.

On account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin&#x27;s usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of &quot;augustus&quot; and be satisfied with that of &quot;caesar&quot;. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force, and yet the threat of the Sassanids remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris. After a time he had withdrawn to Antioch to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with Shapur II. The campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids, however, and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian.

===Death===
Constantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached Mopsuestia in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. The sources claim that realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by Euzoius, the Semi-Arian bishop of Antioch, and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.
Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.

Like Constantine the Great, he was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot;.

==Marriages and children==

Constantius II was married three times:

First to a daughter of his half-uncle Julius Constantius, whose name is unknown. She was a full-sister of Gallus and a half-sister of Julian. She died c. 352/3.

Second, to Eusebia, a woman of Macedonian origin, originally from the city of Thessalonica, whom Constantius married before his defeat of Magnentius in 353. She died before 361.

Third and lastly, in 361, to Faustina, who gave birth to Constantius&#x27;s only child, a posthumous daughter named Constantia, who later married Emperor Gratian.

==Family tree==

Emperors are shown with a rounded-corner border with their dates as Augusti, names with a thicker border appear in both sections

1: Constantine&#x27;s parents and half-siblings




2: Constantine&#x27;s children



==Reputation==

According to DiMaio and Frakes, “...Constantius is hard for the modern historian to fully understand both due to his own actions and due to the interests of the authors of primary sources for his reign.” A. H. M. Jones writes that he &quot;appears in the pages of Ammianus as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage.&quot; However, Kent and M. and A. Hirmer suggest that the emperor &quot;has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to Julian the Apostate and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler&quot;. They go on to add, &quot;Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not&quot;.

Eutropius wrote of him,He was a man of a remarkably tranquil disposition, good-natured, trusting too much to his friends and courtiers, and at last too much in the power of his wives. He conducted himself with great moderation in the commencement of his reign; he enriched his friends, and suffered none, whose active services he had experienced, to go unrewarded. He was however somewhat inclined to severity, whenever any suspicion of an attempt on the government was excited in him; otherwise he was gentle. His fortune is more to be praised in civil than in foreign wars.

<text>Flavius Julius Constans ( 323 – 350), also called Constans I, was Roman emperor from 337 to 350. He held the imperial rank of &quot;caesar&quot; from 333, and was the youngest son of Constantine the Great.

After his father&#x27;s death, he was made &quot;augustus&quot; alongside his brothers in September 337. Constans was given the administration of the praetorian prefectures of Italy, Illyricum, and Africa. He defeated the Sarmatians in a campaign shortly afterwards. Quarrels over the sharing of power led to a civil war with his eldest brother and co-emperor Constantine II, who invaded Italy in 340 and was killed in battle by Constans&#x27;s forces near Aquileia. Constans gained from him the praetorian prefecture of Gaul. Thereafter there were tensions with his remaining brother and co-&quot;augustus&quot; Constantius II (), including over the exiled bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, who in turn eulogized Constans as &quot;the most pious Augustus... of blessed and everlasting memory.&quot; In the following years he campaigned against the Franks, and in 343 he visited Roman Britain, the last legitimate emperor to do so.

In January 350, Magnentius () the commander of the Jovians and Herculians, a corps in the Roman army, was acclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; at Augustodunum (Autun) with the support of Marcellinus, the &quot;comes rei privatae&quot;. Magnentius overthrew and killed Constans. Surviving sources, possibly influenced by the propaganda of Magnentius&#x27;s faction, accuse Constans of misrule and of homosexuality.

==Early life==
Sources variously report Constans&#x27; age at the time of his death as 27 or 30, meaning he was born in either 320 or 323. Timothy Barnes, observing numismatic evidence, considered the younger age to be more likely. He was the third and youngest son of Constantine I and Fausta. According to the works of both Ausonius and Libanius, he was educated at Constantinople under the tutelage of the poet Aemilius Magnus Arborius, who instructed him in Latin.

On 25 December 333, Constans was elevated to the imperial rank of &quot;caesar&quot; at Constantinople by his father. Prior to 337, Constans became engaged to Olympias, the daughter of the praetorian prefect Ablabius, although the two never actually married.

== Reign ==
After Constantine&#x27;s death, Constans and his two brothers, Constantine II and Constantius II were proclaimed &quot;augusti&quot; and divided the Roman empire among themselves on 9 September 337. Constans was left with Italy, Africa and Illyricum. In 338, he campaigned against the Sarmatians.

Meanwhile, Constans came into conflict with his eldest brother Constantine II over the latter&#x27;s presumed authority over Constans&#x27; territory. After attempting to issue legislation to Africa in 339, which was part of Constans&#x27; realm, Constantine led his army into an invasion of Italy only a year later. However, he was ambushed and killed by Constans&#x27; troops, and Constans then took control of his brother&#x27;s territories.

Constans began his reign in an energetic fashion. From 341 to 342, he led a campaign against the Franks where, after an initial setback, the military operation concluded with a victory and a favorable peace treaty. Eutropius wrote that he &quot;had performed many gallant actions in the field, and had made himself feared by the army through the whole course of his life, though without exercising any extraordinary severity,&quot; while Ammianus Marcellinus remarked that Julian was the only person the Alamanni feared after the death of Constans.

In the early months of 343, he visited Britain, an event celebrated enough for Libanius to dedicate several sections of his panegyric to explaining it. Although the reasons for the visit remain unclear, the ancient writers were primarily interested in Constans&#x27; precarious journey to the province, rather than his actions within it. One theory considers it to have involved the northern frontier, based on Ammianus&#x27; remark that he had discussed the Areani in his now-lost coverage of Constans&#x27; reign. Additionally, after recording attacks &quot;near the frontiers&quot; in 360, the historian wrote that the Alamanni were too much of a threat for Julian to confront the problem, in contrast to what Constans was able to do.

Constans was accused of employing corrupt ministers during his reign, due to his purported personal greed. One example included the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; (master of the offices) Flavius Eugenius, who remained in his position throughout most of the 340s. Despite Eugenius being alleged to have misused his power to seize property, the emperor continued to support him, his trust going as far as to honor him with a statue in the Forum of Trajan in Rome.

===Religion===
Constans issued an edict banning superstition and pagan sacrifices in 341, his justification being that he was following the precedent set by his father. Only a short while later though, he tried to moderate his stance by legislating against the destruction of temple buildings.

Constans&#x27; support of Nicene orthodoxy and the bishop Athanasius of Alexandria brought him into conflict with his brother Constantius. Although the two emperors called the Council of Serdica in 343 to settle the conflict, it was a complete failure, and by 345 Constans was outright threatening civil war against his brother. Eventually, Constantius agreed to allow Athanasius to return to his position, as the bishop&#x27;s replacement had recently died. Constans also used the military to suppress Donatism in Africa, where the church was split between Donatists and Catholics.

===Alleged homosexuality===
Unlike Constantius, Constans was targeted with gossip over his personal life. Numerous sources suspected him of homosexuality, presumably based on the fact that he never married. Aurelius Victor charged Constans with &quot;rabid&quot; pederasty towards young barbarian hostages, though Hunt remarked that &quot;the allegation that he kept a coterie of captive barbarians to gratify his homosexual tastes sounds more like hostile folklore.&quot; Constans&#x27; legislation against homosexuality has been cited to dispute the rumor.

==Death==

On 18 January 350, the general Magnentius declared himself emperor at Augustodunum (Autun) with the support of a number of court officials such as Marcellinus, Constans&#x27; comes rerum privatarum, as well as Fabius Titianus, who had previously served as the praetorian prefect of Gaul. At the time, Constans was distracted by a hunting trip. As he was trying to reach Hispania, supporters of Magnentius cornered him in a fortification in Helena (Elne) in the eastern Pyrenees of southwestern Gaul, where he was killed after seeking sanctuary in a temple. An alleged prophecy at his birth had said Constans would die &quot;in the arms of his grandmother&quot;. His place of death happens to have been named after Helena, mother of Constantine and his own grandmother, thus realizing the prophecy. Constans&#x27; name would later be erased from inscriptions in places that recognized Magnentius as emperor.

Regarding possible motives for Constans&#x27; overthrow, ancient sources assert that he was widely unpopular, and attribute his downfall to his own failings. Along with the accusation of corruption, he is also accused of neglecting portions of the empire and treating his soldiers with contempt. Ammianus lamented the emperor&#x27;s failure to listen to wise counsel, referencing one man he believed could have saved Constans from his own faults.

However, some modern scholars have questioned this portrayal. According to historian Jill Harries, &quot;The detail that Constans was in the habit of making journeys with only a small escort may account for his vulnerability in 350.&quot; Based on several factors - the small number of people behind the plot, how the setting for Magnentius&#x27; coup was not a military centre, Vetranio&#x27;s proclamation as emperor in opposition to Magnentius, and Julian&#x27;s report that the usurper had to murder several of Constans&#x27; generals to take control of the Gallic army – she concluded that Magnentius&#x27; revolt was &quot;the result of a private grudge on the part of an apprehensive official and not the outcome of widespread discontent among the military or the wider population.&quot; This view is supported by Peter Crawford, who considered the explanation from the ancient sources to be a misconception caused by the rapid success of the coup.

Harries does, however, acknowledge how the Gallic army accepted Magnentius seemingly without difficulty, and how according to Zosimus, Constantius&#x27; official Philippus emphasized Constantine, rather than Constans, when addressing Magnentius&#x27; troops. On speculating the basis for Constans&#x27; overthrow, she suggested that one reason may have been regarding financial difficulties in Gaul by the end of his reign, which could have been related to the finance officer Marcellinus&#x27; support of him. After Magnentius took power, he levied taxes, sold imperial estates in Gaul and debased the coinage. Nicholas Baker-Brian also observed how Magnentius sent his brother Decentius to defend the region after Constans had neglected it, writing that, &quot;it is apparent that among the reasons for Magnentius&#x27; rebellion was a desire to remedy Constans&#x27; governmental failings in Gaul.&quot;

<doc id="6749" wikidata="Q61391" url="?curid=6749" title="Cheerleading">
<text>Cheerleading is an activity in which the participants (called cheerleaders) cheer for their team as a form of encouragement. It can range from chanting slogans to intense physical activity. It can be performed to motivate sports teams, to entertain the audience, or for competition. Cheerleading routines typically range anywhere from one to three minutes, and contain components of tumbling, dance, jumps, cheers, and stunting. Cheerleading originated in the United States, where it has become a tradition. It is less prevalent in the rest of the world, except via its association with American sports or organized cheerleading contests.

Modern cheerleading is very closely associated with American football and basketball. Sports such as association football (soccer), ice hockey, volleyball, baseball, and wrestling will sometimes sponsor cheerleading squads. The ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in 2007 was the first international cricket event to have cheerleaders. The Florida Marlins were the first Major League Baseball team to have a cheerleading team.

Cheerleading originated as an all-male activity in the United States, and is popular predominantly in America, with an estimated 3.85 million participants in 2017. The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of ESPN&#x27;s International cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film &quot;Bring It On&quot;. The International Cheer Union (ICU) now claims 116 member nations with an estimated 7.5 million participants worldwide.

Around the end of the 2000s the sport had gained traction outside of the United States in countries like Australia, Canada, Mexico, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. However, the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports, such as baseball or basketball, despite efforts being made to popularize the sport at an international level. In 2016, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) recognized the ICU (International Cheer Union) as part of the sports federations; in practice this means that the modality is considered a sport by the IOC, and in the future, depending on negotiations and international popularization, it could become part of the Olympic Games.

Scientific studies of cheerleading show that it carries the highest rate of catastrophic injuries to female athletes in sports, with most injuries associated with stunting, also known as pyramids. One 2011 study of American female athletes showed that cheerleading resulted in 65% of all catastrophic injuries in female sports.

==History==

===Before organized cheerleading===
In the 1860s, students from Great Britain began to cheer and chant in unison for their favorite athletes at sporting events. Soon, that gesture of support crossed overseas to America.

On November 6, 1869, the United States witnessed its first intercollegiate football game. It took place between Princeton University and Rutgers University, and marked the day the original &quot;Sis Boom Rah!&quot; cheer was shouted out by student fans.

===Beginning of organized cheerleading===

Organized cheerleading began as an all-male activity. As early as 1877, Princeton University had a &quot;Princeton Cheer&quot;, documented in the February 22, 1877, March 12, 1880, and November 4, 1881, issues of &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;. This cheer was yelled from the stands by students attending games, as well as by the athletes themselves. The cheer, &quot;Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Tiger! S-s-s-t! Boom! A-h-h-h!&quot; remains in use with slight modifications today, where it is now referred to as the &quot;Locomotive&quot;.

Princeton class of 1882 graduate Thomas Peebles moved to Minnesota in 1884. He transplanted the idea of organized crowds cheering at football games to the University of Minnesota.

The term &quot;Cheer Leader&quot; had been used as early as 1897, with Princeton&#x27;s football officials having named three students as &quot;Cheer Leaders:&quot; Thomas, Easton, and Guerin from Princeton&#x27;s classes of 1897, 1898, and 1899, respectively, on October 26, 1897. These students would cheer for the team also at football practices, and special cheering sections were designated in the stands for the games themselves for both the home and visiting teams.

It was not until 1898 that University of Minnesota student Johnny Campbell directed a crowd in cheering &quot;Rah, Rah, Rah! Ski-u-mah, Hoo-Rah! Hoo-Rah! Varsity! Varsity! Varsity, Minn-e-So-Tah!&quot;, making Campbell the very first cheerleader.

November 2, 1898, is the official birth date of organized cheerleading. Soon after, the University of Minnesota organized a &quot;yell leader&quot; squad of six male students, who still use Campbell&#x27;s original cheer today.

===Early 20th century cheerleading and female participation===

In 1903, the first cheerleading fraternity, Gamma Sigma, was founded.

In 1923, at the University of Minnesota, women were permitted to participate in cheerleading. However, it took time for other schools to follow. In the late 1920s, many school manuals and newspapers that were published still referred to cheerleaders as &quot;chap&quot;, &quot;fellow&quot;, and &quot;man&quot;.

Women cheerleaders were overlooked until the 1940s when collegiate men were drafted for World War II, creating the opportunity for more women to make their way onto sporting event sidelines. As noted by Kieran Scott in &quot;Ultimate Cheerleading&quot;: &quot;Girls really took over for the first time.&quot;

In 1949, Lawrence Herkimer, a former cheerleader at Southern Methodist University and inventor of the herkie jump, founded his first cheerleading camp in Huntsville, Texas. 52 girls were in attendance. The clinic was so popular that Herkimer was asked to hold a second, where 350 young women were in attendance. Herkimer also patented the pom-pom.

===Growth in popularity (1950–1979)===

In 1951, Herkimer created the National Cheerleading Association to help grow the activity and provide cheerleading education to schools around the country.

During the 1950s, female participation in cheerleading continued to grow. An overview written on behalf of cheerleading in 1955 explained that in larger schools, &quot;occasionally boys as well as girls are included&quot;, and in smaller schools, &quot;boys can usually find their place in the athletic program, and cheerleading is likely to remain solely a feminine occupation&quot;. Cheerleading could be found at almost every school level across the country; even pee wee and youth leagues began to appear.

In the 1950s, professional cheerleading also began. The first recorded cheer squad in National Football League (NFL) history was for the Baltimore Colts. Professional cheerleaders put a new perspective on American cheerleading. Women were exclusively chosen for dancing ability as well as to conform to the male gaze, as heterosexual men were the targeted marketing group.

By the 1960s, college cheerleaders employed by the NCA were hosting workshops across the nation, teaching fundamental cheer skills to tens of thousands of high-school-age girls. Herkimer also contributed many notable firsts to cheerleading: the founding of a cheerleading uniform supply company, inventing the herkie jump (where one leg is bent towards the ground as if kneeling and the other is out to the side as high as it will stretch in toe-touch position), and creating the &quot;Spirit Stick&quot;.

In 1965, Fred Gastoff invented the vinyl pom-pom, which was introduced into competitions by the International Cheerleading Foundation (ICF, now the World Cheerleading Association, or WCA). Organized cheerleading competitions began to pop up with the first ranking of the &quot;Top Ten College Cheerleading Squads&quot; and &quot;Cheerleader All America&quot; awards given out by the ICF in 1967.

The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders soon gained the spotlight with their revealing outfits and sophisticated dance moves, debuting in the 1972–1973 season, but were first widely seen in Super Bowl X (1976). These pro squads of the 1970s established cheerleaders as &quot;American icons of wholesome sex appeal.&quot;

In 1975, Randy Neil estimated that over 500,000 students actively participated in American cheerleading from elementary school to the collegiate level. Neil also approximated that ninety-five percent of cheerleaders within America were female.

In 1978, America was introduced to competitive cheerleading by the first broadcast of Collegiate Cheerleading Championships on CBS.

===1980s to present===
The 1980s saw the beginning of modern cheerleading, adding difficult stunt sequences and gymnastics into routines. All-star teams, or those not affiliated with a school, popped up, and eventually led to the creation of the U.S. All Star Federation (USASF). ESPN first broadcast the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983.

By 1981, a total of seventeen Nation Football League teams had their own cheerleaders. The only teams without NFL cheerleaders at this time were New Orleans, New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Denver, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and San Diego. Professional cheerleading eventually spread to soccer and basketball teams as well.

Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids, and tumbling passes from being included in the cheerleading routines. In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all-star, and college coaches. The NCAA now requires college cheer coaches to successfully complete a nationally recognized safety-training program.

Even with its athletic and competitive development, cheerleading at the school level has retained its ties to its spirit leading traditions. Cheerleaders are quite often seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body. At the college level, cheerleaders are often invited to help at university fundraisers and events.

Debuting in 2003, the &quot;Marlin Mermaids&quot; gained national exposure, and have influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads.

In 2005, overall statistics show around 97% of all modern cheerleading participants are female, although at the collegiate level, cheerleading is co-ed with about 50% of participants being male. Modern male cheerleaders&#x27; stunts focus less on flexibility and more on tumbling, flips, pikes, and handstands. These depend on strong legs and strong core strength.

In 2019, Napoleon Jinnies and Quinton Peron became the first male cheerleaders in the history of the NFL to perform at the Super Bowl.

=== Safety regulation changes ===
Kristi Yamaoka, a cheerleader for Southern Illinois University, suffered a fractured vertebra when she hit her head after falling from a human pyramid. She also suffered from a concussion, and a bruised lung. The fall occurred when Yamaoka lost her balance during a basketball game between Southern Illinois University and Bradley University at the Savvis Center in St. Louis on March 5, 2006. The fall gained &quot;national attention&quot;, because Yamaoka continued to perform from a stretcher as she was moved away from the game.

The accident caused the Missouri Valley Conference to ban its member schools from allowing cheerleaders to be &quot;launched or tossed and from taking part in formations higher than two levels&quot; for one week during a women&#x27;s basketball conference tournament, and also resulted in a recommendation by the NCAA that conferences and tournaments do not allow pyramids two and one half levels high or higher, and a stunt known as basket tosses, during the rest of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball season. On July 11, 2006, the bans were made permanent by the AACCA rules committee:

The committee unanimously voted for sweeping revisions to cheerleading safety rules, the most major of which restricts specific upper-level skills during basketball games. Basket tosses, high pyramids, one-arm stunts, stunts that involve twisting or flipping, and twisting tumbling skills may be performed only during halftime and post-game on a matted surface and are prohibited during game play or time-outs.
==Types of teams in the United States today==

===School-sponsored===
Most American elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and colleges have organized cheerleading squads. Some colleges even offer cheerleading scholarships for students. A school cheerleading team may compete locally, regionally, or nationally, but their main purpose is typically to cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation. Cheerleading is quickly becoming a year-round activity, starting with tryouts during the spring semester of the preceding school year. Teams may attend organized summer cheerleading camps and practices to improve skills and create routines for competition.

In addition to supporting their schools&#x27; football or other sports teams, student cheerleaders may compete with recreational-style routine at competitions year-round.

====Elementary school====
In far more recent years, it has become more common for elementary schools to have an organized cheerleading team. This is a great way to get younger children introduced to the sport and used to being crowd leaders. Also, with young children learning so much so quickly, tumbling can come very easy to a child in elementary school.

====Middle school====
Middle school cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads were created and is set at the district level. In middle school, cheerleading squads serve the same purpose, but often follow a modified set of rules from high school squads with possible additional rules. Squads can cheer for basketball teams, football teams, and other sports teams in their school. Squads may also perform at pep rallies and compete against other local schools from the area. Cheerleading in middle school sometimes can be a two-season activity: fall and winter. However, many middle school cheer squads will go year-round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, yet may perform less extreme stunts and tumbling elements, depending on the rules in their area..

====High school====

In high school, there are usually two squads per school: varsity and a junior varsity. High school cheerleading contains aspects of school spirit as well as competition. These squads have become part of a year-round cycle. Starting with tryouts in the spring, year-round practice, cheering on teams in the fall and winter, and participating in cheerleading competitions. Most squads practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually practiced five- to six-days-a-week. During competition season, it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and &quot;hyping up&quot; the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even at wrestling meets. Along with this, cheerleaders usually perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to other students. In May 2009, the National Federation of State High School Associations released the results of their first true high school participation study. They estimated that the number of high school cheerleaders from public high schools is around 394,700.

There are different cheerleading organizations that put on competitions; some of the major ones include state and regional competitions. Many high schools will often host cheerleading competitions, bringing in IHSA judges. The regional competitions are qualifiers for national competitions, such as the UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association) in Orlando, Florida, every year. Many teams have a professional choreographer that choreographs their routine in order to ensure they are not breaking rules or regulations and to give the squad creative elements.

===College===
Most American universities have a cheerleading squad to cheer for football, basketball, volleyball, wrestling, and soccer. Most college squads tend to be larger coed teams, although in recent years; all-girl squads and smaller college squads have increased rapidly. Cheerleading is not recognized by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA as athletics; therefore, there are few to no scholarships offered to athletes wanting to pursue cheerleading at the collegiate level. However, some community colleges and universities offer scholarships directly from the program or sponsorship funds. Some colleges offer scholarships for an athlete&#x27;s talents, academic excellence, and/or involvement in community events.

College squads perform more difficult stunts which include multi-level pyramids, as well as flipping and twisting basket tosses.

Not only do college cheerleaders cheer on the other sports at their university, many teams at universities compete with other schools at either UCA College Nationals or NCA College Nationals. This requires the teams to choreograph a 2-minute and 30 second routine that includes elements of jumps, tumbling, stunting, basket tosses, pyramids, and a crowd involvement section. Winning one of these competitions is a very prestigious accomplishment, and is seen as another national title for most schools.

===Youth leagues and athletic associations===
Organizations that sponsor youth cheer teams usually sponsor either youth league football or basketball teams as well. This allows for the two, under the same sponsor, to be intermingled. Both teams have the same mascot name and the cheerleaders will perform at their football or basketball games. Examples of such sponsors include Pop Warner, American Youth Football, and the YMCA. The purpose of these squads is primarily to support their associated football or basketball players, but some teams do compete at local or regional competitions. The Pop Warner Association even hosts a national championship each December for teams in their program who qualify.

===All-star or club cheerleading===
&quot;All-star&quot; or club cheerleading differs from school or sideline cheerleading because all-star teams focus solely on performing a competition routine and not on leading cheers for other sports teams. All-star cheerleaders are members of a privately owned gym or club which they typically pay dues or tuition to, similar to a gymnastics gym.

During the early 1980s, cheerleading squads not associated with a school or sports league, whose main objective was competition, began to emerge. The first organization to call themselves all-stars were the Q94 Rockers from Richmond, Virginia, founded in 1982. All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986, the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions. As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations, and divisions. This situation became a concern to coaches and gym owners, as the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.

The United States All Star Federation (USASF) was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging criteria to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation. Eager to grow the sport and create more opportunities for high-level teams, The USASF hosted the first Cheerleading Worlds on April 24, 2004. At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF to become their rule making body. In late 2006, the USASF facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF), which now governs club cheerleading worldwide.

All-star cheerleading, as sanctioned by the USASF, involves a squad of 5–36 females and males. All-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level. The age groups vary from under 4 years of age to 18 years and over. The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they actually perform only for up to minutes during their team&#x27;s routine. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in six to ten competitions a year. These competitions include locals or regionals, which normally take place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in large venues all around the U.S., and the Cheerleading Worlds, which takes place at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping, and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so that the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.

All-star cheerleaders compete at competitions hosted by private event production companies, the foremost of these being Varsity Spirit. Varsity Spirit is the parent company for many subsidiaries including The National Cheerleader&#x27;s Association, The Universal Cheerleader&#x27;s Association, AmeriCheer, Allstar Challenge, and JamFest, among others. Each separate company or subsidiary typically hosts their own local and national level competitions. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.

Judges at a competition watch closely for illegal skills from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal skill is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty or safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt or a tumbler who does not stick a landing. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.

If a level 6 or 7 team places high enough at selected USASF/IASF sanctioned national competitions, they could earn a place at the Cheerleading Worlds and compete against teams from all over the world, as well as receive money for placing. For elite level cheerleaders, The Cheerleading Worlds is the highest level of competition to which they can aspire, and winning a world championship title is an incredible honor.

===Professional===
Professional cheerleaders and dancers cheer for sports such as football, basketball, baseball, wrestling, or hockey. There are only a small handful of professional cheerleading leagues around the world; some professional leagues include the NBA Cheerleading League, the NFL Cheerleading League, the CFL Cheerleading League, the MLS Cheerleading League, the MLB Cheerleading League, and the NHL Ice Girls. Although professional cheerleading leagues exist in multiple countries, there are no Olympic teams.

In addition to cheering at games and competing, professional cheerleaders often do a lot of philanthropy and charity work, modeling, motivational speaking, television performances, and advertising.

==Injuries and accidents==
Cheerleading carries the highest rate of catastrophic injuries to female athletes in high school and collegiate sports. Of the United States&#x27; 2.9 million female high school athletes, only 3% are cheerleaders, yet cheerleading accounts for nearly 65% of all catastrophic injuries in girls&#x27; high school athletics. In data covering the 1982–83 academic year through the 2018–19 academic year in the US, the rate of serious, direct traumatic injury per 100,000 participants was 1.68 for female cheerleaders at the high school level, the highest for all high school sports surveyed. The college rate could not be determined, as the total number of collegiate cheerleaders was unknown, but the total number of traumatic, direct catastrophic injuries over this period was 33 (28 female, 5 male), higher than all sports at this level aside from football. Another study found that between 1982 and 2007, there were 103 fatal, disabling, or serious injuries recorded among female high school athletes, with the vast majority (67) occurring in cheerleading.

The main source of injuries comes from stunting, also known as pyramids. These stunts are performed at games and pep rallies, as well as competitions. Sometimes competition routines are focused solely around the use of difficult and risky stunts. These stunts usually include a flyer (the person on top), along with one or two bases (the people on the bottom), and one or two spotters in the front and back on the bottom. The most common cheerleading related injury is a concussion. 96% of those concussions are stunt related. Other injuries include: sprained ankles, sprained wrists, back injuries, head injuries (sometimes concussions), broken arms, elbow injuries, knee injuries, broken noses, and broken collarbones. Sometimes, however, injuries can be as serious as whiplash, broken necks, broken vertebrae, and death.

The journal &quot;Pediatrics&quot; has reportedly said that the number of cheerleaders suffering from broken bones, concussions, and sprains has increased by over 100 percent between the years of 1990 and 2002, and that in 2001, there were 25,000 hospital visits reported for cheerleading injuries dealing with the shoulder, ankle, head, and neck. Meanwhile, in the US, cheerleading accounted for 65.1% of all major physical injuries to high school females, and to 66.7% of major injuries to college students due to physical activity from 1982 to 2007, with 22,900 minors being admitted to hospital with cheerleading-related injuries in 2002.

The risks of cheerleading were highlighted at the death of Lauren Chang. Chang died on April 14, 2008, after competing in a competition where her teammate had kicked her so hard in the chest that her lungs collapsed.

Cheerleading (for both girls and boys) was one of the sports studied in the Pediatric Injury Prevention, Education and Research Program of the Colorado School of Public Health in 2009/10–2012/13. Data on cheerleading injuries is included in the report for 2012–13.

==Associations, federations, and organizations==

International Cheer Union (ICU): Established on April 26, 2004, the ICU is recognized by the SportAccord as the world governing body of cheerleading and the authority on all matters with relation to it. Including participation from its 105-member national federations reaching 3.5 million athletes globally, the ICU continues to serve as the unified voice for those dedicated to cheerleading&#x27;s positive development around the world.

In accordance with the SportAccord statutes, the ICU is recognized as the world governing body of cheerleading and the authority on all matters related to it.

The ICU has introduced a Junior aged team (12–16) to compete at the Cheerleading Worlds, because cheerleading is now in provisional status to become a sport in the Olympics. For cheerleading to one day be in the Olympics, there must be a junior and senior team that competes at the world championships. The first junior cheerleading team that was selected to become the junior national team was Eastside Middle School, located in Mount Washington Kentucky and will represent the United States in the inaugural junior division at the world championships.

The ICU holds training seminars for judges and coaches, global events and the World Cheerleading Championships. The ICU is also fully applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is compliant under the code set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

USA Cheer: The USA Federation for Sport Cheering (USA Cheer) was established in 2007 to serve as the national governing body for all types of cheerleading in the United States and is recognized by the ICU. &quot;The USA Federation for Sport Cheering is a not-for profit 501(c)(6) organization that was established in 2007 to serve as the National Governing Body for Sport Cheering in the United States. USA Cheer exists to serve the cheer community, including club cheering (all star) and traditional school based cheer programs, and the growing sport of STUNT. USA Cheer has three primary objectives: help grow and develop interest and participation in cheer throughout the United States; promote safety and safety education for cheer in the United States; and represent the United States of America in international cheer competitions.&quot; In March 2018, they absorbed the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA) and now provide safety guidelines and training for all levels of cheerleading. Additionally, they organize the USA National Team.

Universal Cheerleading Association: UCA is an association owned by the company brand Varsity. &quot;Universal Cheerleaders Association was founded in 1974 by Jeff Webb to provide the best educational training for cheerleaders with the goal of incorporating high-level skills with traditional crowd leading.

==Title IX sports status==
In the United States, the designation of a &quot;sport&quot; is important because of Title IX. There is a large debate on whether or not cheerleading should be considered a sport for Title IX (a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 forbidding discrimination under any education program on the basis of sex) purposes. These arguments have varied from institution to institution and are reflected in how they treat and organize cheerleading within their schools. Some institutions have been accused of not providing equal opportunities to their male students or for not treating cheerleading as a sport, which reflects on the opportunities they provide to their athletes.

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued memos and letters to schools that cheerleading, both sideline and competitive, may not be considered &quot;athletic programs&quot; for the purposes of Title IX. Supporters consider cheerleading, as a whole, a sport, citing the heavy use of athletic talents while critics see it as a physical activity because a &quot;sport&quot; implies a competition among all squads and not all squads compete, along with subjectivity of competitions where—as with gymnastics, diving, and figure skating—scores are assessed based on human judgment and not an objective goal or measurement of time.

The Office for Civil Rights&#x27; primary concern was ensuring that institutions complied with Title IX, which means offering equal opportunities to all students despite their gender. In their memos, their main point against cheerleading being a sport was that the activity is underdeveloped and unorganized to have varsity-level athletic standing among students. This claim was not universal and the Office for Civil Rights would review cheerleading on a case-by-case basis. Due to this the status of cheerleading under Title IX has varied from region to region based on the institution and how they organize their teams. However, within their decisions, the Office for Civil Rights never clearly stated any guidelines on what was and was not considered a sport under Title IX.

On January 27, 2009, in a lawsuit involving an accidental injury sustained during a cheerleading practice, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that cheerleading is a full-contact sport in that state, not allowing any participants to be sued for accidental injury. In contrast, on July 21, 2010, in a lawsuit involving whether college cheerleading qualified as a sport for purposes of Title IX, a federal court, citing a current lack of program development and organization, ruled that it is not a sport at all.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) does not recognize cheerleading as a sport. In 2014, the American Medical Association adopted a policy that, as the leading cause of catastrophic injuries of female athletes both in high school and college, cheerleading should be considered a sport. While there are cheerleading teams at the majority of the NCAA&#x27;s Division I schools, they are still not recognized as a sport. This results in many teams not being properly funded. Additionally, there are little to no college programs offering scholarships because their universities cannot offer athletic scholarships to &quot;spirit&quot; team members.

=== Title IX Guidelines for Sports ports ===
In 2010, Quinnipiac University was sued for not providing equal opportunities for female athletes as required by Title IX. The university disbanded its volleyball team and created a new competitive cheerleading sports team. The issue with Biediger v. Quinnipiac University is centered around whether competitive cheerleading could be considered a sport for Title IX. The university had not provided additional opportunities for their female athletes which led to the court ruling in favor that cheerleading could not count as a varsity sport. This case established clear guidelines on what qualifies as a sport under Title IX, these guidelines are known as the three-pronged approach. The three-pronged approach is as follows:

* Prong 1. Whether the number of female and male student participation within the intercollegiate sport is at a sustainable ratio based on the number of students enrolled at the institution
* Prong 2. Whether the institution has provided, both in the past and ongoing, opportunities to intercollegiate athletes that are members of a sex that is currently underrepresented in their sport.
* Prong 3. Whether intercollegiate athletes of an underrepresented sex have been fully accommodated by their institution based on their athlete&#x27;s interests in sports.

The three-pronged approach was the first official guideline that clearly stated what criteria were necessary when deciding what activity was considered a sport or not under Title IX. This approach was used and is still continued to be used by the Office for Civil Rights. Based on this approach the Office for Civil Rights still considers cheerleading, including both sideline and competitive, not a sport under Title IX.

==Cheerleading in Canada==

Cheerleading in Canada is rising in popularity among the youth in co-curricular programs. Cheerleading has grown from the sidelines to a competitive activity throughout the world and in particular Canada. Cheerleading has a few streams in Canadian sports culture. It is available at the middle-school, high-school, collegiate, and best known for all-star. There are multiple regional, provincial, and national championship opportunities for all athletes participating in cheerleading. Canada does not have provincial teams, just a national program referred to as Team Canada, facilitated by Cheer Canada. Their first year as a national team was in 2009 when they represented Canada at the International Cheer Union World Cheerleading Championships International Cheer Union (ICU).

===Competition and governance in Canada===
Cheer Canada acts as the Canadian national governing body for cheer, as recognised by the International Cheer Union. There are a number of provincial sports organizations that also exist in Canada under Cheer Canada, each governing cheer within their province which BC Sport Cheer, Alberta Cheerleading Association, Saskatchewan Cheerleading Association, Cheer Manitoba, Ontario Cheerleading Federation, Federation de Cheerleading du Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador Cheerleading Athletics, Cheer New Brunswick and Cheer Nova Scotia. Cheer Canada and the provincial organizations utilise the IASF divisions and rules for all star cheer and performance cheer (all star dance) and the ICU divisions and rules for scholastic cheer. Canadian Cheer (previously known as Cheer Evolution) is the largest cheer and dance organization for Canada, and currently comply to Cheer Canada&#x27;s rules and guidelines for their 15 events. Varsity Spirit also hosts events within Canada utilising the Cheer Canada/IASF rules. There are currently over 400 clubs and schools recognised by Cheer Canada, with over 25,000 participants in 2023.

===Canadian cheer on the global stage===
There are two world championship competitions that Canada participates in. The first is the ICU World Championships where the Canadian National Teams compete against other countries. The second is The Cheerleading Worlds where Canadian club teams, referred to as &quot;all-star&quot; teams, compete within the IASF divisions. National team members who compete at the ICU Worlds can also compete with their &quot;all-star club&quot; teams at the IASF World Championships. Although athletes can compete in both International Cheer Union (ICU) and IASF championships, crossovers between teams at each individual competition are not permitted. Teams compete against the other teams from their countries on the first day of competition and the top three teams from each country in each division continue to finals. At the end of finals, the top team scoring the highest for their country earns the &quot;Nations Cup&quot;. Canada has multiple teams across their country that compete in the IASF Cheerleading Worlds Championship. In total, Canada has had 98 International podium finishes at cheer events.

The International Cheer Union (ICU) is built of 119 member nations, who are eligible to field teams to compete against one another at the ICU World Championships in a number of divisions in both cheerleading and performance cheer, with special divisions for youth, junior and adaptive abilities athletes. Cheer Canada fields a national team, with up to 40 athletes from around the country for both a senior national all girl and senior national coed team training at three training camps across the season in Canada before 28 athletes per team are selected to train in Florida, with 24 athletes going on to compete on the competition floor at ICU Worlds. In the 2023 ICU World Championships, Canada won a total of 4 medals (1 gold and 3 silver) with teams entered in the Youth All Girl, Youth Coed, Unified Median, Unified Advanced, Premier All Girl, Premier Coed, Performance Cheer Hip Hop doubles, Performance Cheer Pom Doubles and Performance Cheer Pom divisions.

In total, Team Canada holds podium placements at the ICU World Championships from the following years/divisions: 
== Cheerleading in Mexico ==

Cheerleading in Mexico is a popular sport commonly seen in Mexican College Football and Professional Mexican Soccer sporting events. Cheerleading emerged within the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the highest House of Studies in the country, during the 1930s, almost immediately after it was granted its autonomy. Since then, this phenomenon has been evolving to become what it is now. Firstly, it was developed only in the UNAM, later in other secondary and higher education institutions in Mexico City, and currently in practically the entire country.

=== Competition in Mexico ===
In Mexico, this sport is endorsed by the Mexican Federation of Cheerleaders and Cheerleading Groups (Federación Mexicana de Porristas y Grupos de Animación) (FMPGA), a body that regulates competitions in Mexico and subdivisions such as the Olympic Confederation of Cheerleaders (COP Brands), National Organization of Cheerleaders (Organización Nacional de Porristas) (ONP) and the Mexican Organization of Trainers and Animation Groups (Organización Mexicana de Entrenadores y Grupos de Animación) (OMEGA Mexico), these being the largest in the country.

In 2021, the third edition of the National Championship of State Teams was held and organized by The Mexican Federation of Cheerleaders and Cheerleading Groups, on this occasion, the event was held virtually, broadcasting live, through the Vimeo platform.

=== Mexican Cheer of the Global Stage ===
In Mexico there are more than 500 teams and almost 10,000 athletes who practice this sport, in addition to a representative national team of Mexico, which won first place in the cheerleading world championship organized by the ICU (International Cheer Union) on April 24, 2015, receiving a gold medal; In 2016, Mexico became the second country with the most medals in the world in this sport. With 27 medals, it is considered the second world power in this sport, only behind the United States. In the 2019 Coed Premier World Cheerleading Championship Mexico ranked 4th just behind the United States, Canada and Taiwan. In 2021, the Mexican team won 3rd place at the Junior Boom category in World Cheerleading Championship 2021 hosted by international cheerleading federation.

<text>The Cottingley Fairies appear in a series of five photographs taken by Elsie Wright (1901–1988) and Frances Griffiths (1907–1986), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures came to the attention of writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. Doyle was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of supernatural phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, others believed that they had been faked.

Interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921. Both girls married and lived abroad for a time after they grew up, and yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper traced Elsie, who had by then returned to the United Kingdom. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.

In the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children&#x27;s book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. As of 2019 the photographs and the cameras used are in the collections of the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.

==1917 photographs==
In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her motherboth newly arrived in England from South Africawere staying with Frances&#x27;s aunt, Elsie Wright&#x27;s mother, Polly, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers&#x27; annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father&#x27;s camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, &quot;triumphant&quot;.

Elsie&#x27;s father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter&#x27;s artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer&#x27;s studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be &quot;nothing but a prank&quot;, and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.

Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote &quot;It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.&quot;

The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie&#x27;s mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on &quot;fairy life&quot;, and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker. As a result, the photographs were displayed at the society&#x27;s annual conference in Harrogate, held a few months later. There they came to the attention of a leading member of the society, Edward Gardner. One of the central beliefs of theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution, towards increasing &quot;perfection&quot;, and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement:
==Initial examinations==
Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert. Snelling&#x27;s opinion was that &quot;the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs ... [with] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models&quot;. He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that &quot;these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time&quot;. Gardner had the prints &quot;clarified&quot; by Snelling, and new negatives produced, &quot;more conducive to printing&quot;, for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around Britain. Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner&#x27;s lectures.

Author and prominent spiritualist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle learned of the photographs from the editor of the spiritualist publication &quot;Light&quot;. Doyle had been commissioned by &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue, and the fairy photographs &quot;must have seemed like a godsend&quot; according to broadcaster and historian Magnus Magnusson. Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was &quot;obviously impressed&quot; that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be &quot;soiled&quot; by money.

Gardner and Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company Kodak. Several of the company&#x27;s technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures &quot;showed no signs of being faked&quot;, they concluded that &quot;this could not be taken as conclusive evidence ... that they were authentic photographs of fairies&quot;. Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity. Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented &quot;after all, as fairies couldn&#x27;t be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow&quot;. The prints were also examined by another photographic company, Ilford, who reported unequivocally that there was &quot;some evidence of faking&quot;. Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs&#x27; authenticity and one against.

Doyle also showed the photographs to the physicist and pioneering psychical researcher Sir Oliver Lodge, who believed the photographs to be fake. He suggested that a troupe of dancers had masqueraded as fairies, and expressed doubt as to their &quot;distinctly &#x27;Parisienne hairstyles.

On 4 October 2018 the first two of the photographs, &quot;Alice and the Fairies&quot; and &quot;Iris and the Gnome,&quot; were to be sold by Dominic Winter Auctioneers, in Gloucestershire. The prints, suspected to have been made in 1920 to sell at theosophical lectures, were expected to bring £700–£1000 each. As it turned out, &quot;Iris with the Gnome&quot; sold for a hammer price of £5,400 (plus 24% buyer&#x27;s premium incl. VAT), while &quot;Alice and the Fairies&quot; sold for a hammer price of £15,000 (plus 24% buyer&#x27;s premium incl. VAT).

==1920 photographs==
Doyle was preoccupied with organising an imminent lecture tour of Australia, and in July 1920, sent Gardner to meet the Wright family. By this point, Frances was living with her parents in Scarborough, but Elsie&#x27;s father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck (stream), looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts, but found nothing &quot;incriminating&quot;.

Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs&#x27; authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two W. Butcher &amp; Sons Cameo folding plate cameras and 24 secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies. Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 &quot;Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies&quot;:

Until 19 August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie&#x27;s mother was persuaded to visit her sister&#x27;s for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, &quot;Frances and the Leaping Fairy&quot;, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, &quot;Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie&quot;, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, &quot;Fairies and Their Sun-Bath&quot;.

The plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London, who sent an &quot;ecstatic&quot; telegram to Doyle, by then in Melbourne. Doyle wrote back:
==Publication and reaction==

Doyle&#x27;s article in the December 1920 issue of &quot;The Strand&quot; contained two higher-resolution prints of the 1917 photographs, and sold out within days of publication. To protect the girls&#x27; anonymity, Frances and Elsie were called Alice and Iris respectively, and the Wright family was referred to as the &quot;Carpenters&quot;. An enthusiastic and committed spiritualist, Doyle hoped that if the photographs convinced the public of the existence of fairies then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena. He ended his article with the words:

Early press coverage was &quot;mixed&quot;, generally a combination of &quot;embarrassment and puzzlement&quot;; though Japanese scholar Kaori Inuma has noted that there were also open and positive assessments. The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published a series of articles in the literary journal &quot;John O&#x27; London&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, in which he concluded: &quot;And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them.&quot; The London newspaper &quot;Truth&quot; on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; &quot;For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children.&quot; Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: &quot;How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed.&quot; The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: &quot;Look at Alice&#x27;s [Frances&#x27;] face. Look at Iris&#x27;s [Elsie&#x27;s] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10 million faces and forms – it is God&#x27;s currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can&#x27;t imitate it.&quot;

Major John Hall-Edwards, a keen photographer and pioneer of medical X-ray treatments in Britain, was a particularly vigorous critic:

Doyle used the later photographs in 1921 to illustrate a second article in &quot;The Strand&quot;, in which he described other accounts of fairy sightings. The article formed the foundation for his 1922 book &quot;The Coming of the Fairies&quot;. As before, the photographs were received with mixed credulity. Sceptics noted that the fairies &quot;looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales&quot; and that they had &quot;very fashionable hairstyles&quot;.

==Gardner&#x27;s final visit==
Gardner made a final visit to Cottingley in August 1921. He again brought cameras and photographic plates for Frances and Elsie, but was accompanied by the occultist Geoffrey Hodson. Although neither of the girls claimed to see any fairies, and there were no more photographs, &quot;on the contrary, he [Hodson] saw them [fairies] everywhere&quot; and wrote voluminous notes on his observations.

By now Elsie and Frances were tired of the whole fairy business. Years later Elsie looked at a photograph of herself and Frances taken with Hodson and said: &quot;Look at that, fed up with fairies.&quot; Both Elsie and Frances later admitted that they &quot;played along&quot; with Hodson &quot;out of mischief&quot;, and that they considered him &quot;a fake&quot;.

==Later investigations==
Public interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances both eventually married, moved away from the area and each lived overseas for varying periods of time. In 1966, a reporter from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been &quot;figments of my imagination&quot;, but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts. The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie&#x27;s photographs once again. BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Nationwide&quot; programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie stuck to her story: &quot;I&#x27;ve told you that they&#x27;re photographs of figments of our imagination, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m sticking to&quot;.

Elsie and Frances were interviewed by journalist Austin Mitchell in September 1976, for a programme broadcast on Yorkshire Television. When pressed, both women agreed that &quot;a rational person doesn&#x27;t see fairies&quot;, but they denied having fabricated the photographs. In 1978 the magician and scientific sceptic James Randi and a team from the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal examined the photographs, using a &quot;computer enhancement process&quot;. They concluded that the photographs were fakes, and that strings could be seen supporting the fairies. Geoffrey Crawley, editor of the &quot;British Journal of Photography&quot;, undertook a &quot;major scientific investigation of the photographs and the events surrounding them&quot;, published between 1982 and 1983, &quot;the first major postwar analysis of the affair&quot;. He also concluded that the pictures were fakes.

==Confession==
In 1983, the cousins admitted in an article published in the magazine &quot;The Unexplained&quot; that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained that they really had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children&#x27;s book of the time, &quot;Princess Mary&#x27;s Gift Book&quot;, published in 1914, and drew wings on them. They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with hatpins, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken. But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his &quot;The Coming of the Fairies&quot; described in this way:

Elsie maintained it was a fake, just like all the others, but Frances insisted that it was genuine. In an interview given in the early 1980s Frances said:

Both Frances and Elsie claimed to have taken the fifth photograph. In a letter published in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper on 9 April 1983, Geoffrey Crawley explained the discrepancy by suggesting that the photograph was &quot;an unintended double exposure of fairy cutouts in the grass&quot;, and thus &quot;both ladies can be quite sincere in believing that they each took it&quot;.

In a 1985 interview on Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s World of Strange Powers&quot;, Elsie said that she and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes: &quot;Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well, we could only keep quiet.&quot; In the same interview Frances said: &quot;I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can&#x27;t understand to this day why they were taken in – they wanted to be taken in.&quot;

==Subsequent history==
Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints of their photographs of the fairies, along with a few other items including a first edition of Doyle&#x27;s book &quot;The Coming of the Fairies&quot;, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.
The glass photographic plates were bought for £6,000 by an unnamed buyer at a London auction held in 2001.

Frances&#x27;s daughter, Christine Lynch, appeared in an episode of the television programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in Belfast, broadcast on BBC One in January 2009, with the photographs and one of the cameras given to the girls by Doyle. Christine told the expert, Paul Atterbury, that she believed, as her mother had done, that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine. Atterbury estimated the value of the items at between £25,000 and £30,000. The first edition of Frances&#x27;s memoirs was published a few months later, under the title &quot;Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies&quot;. The book contains correspondence, sometimes &quot;bitter&quot;, between Elsie and Frances. In one letter, dated 1983, Frances wrote:
The 1997 films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Photographing Fairies&quot; were inspired by the events surrounding the Cottingley Fairies. The photographs were parodied in a 1994 book written by Terry Jones and Brian Froud, &quot;Lady Cottington&#x27;s Pressed Fairy Book&quot;. In A. J. Elwood&#x27;s 2021 novel, &quot;The Cottingley Cuckoo&quot;, a series of letters were written soon after the Cottingley fairy photographs were published claiming further sightings of fairies and proof of their existence.

In 2017 a further two fairy photographs were presented as evidence that the girls&#x27; parents were part of the conspiracy. Dating from 1917 and 1918, both photographs are poorly executed copies of two of the original fairy photographs. One was published in 1918 in &quot;The Sphere&quot; newspaper, which was before the originals had been seen by anyone outside the girls&#x27; immediate family.

In 2019, a print of the first of the five photographs sold for £1,050. A print of the second was also put up for sale but failed to sell as it did not meet its £500 reserve price. The pictures previously belonged to the Reverend George Vale Owen. In December 2019, the third camera used to take the images was acquired by the National Science and Media Museum.

<doc id="6752" wikidata="Q203023" url="?curid=6752" title="Cheka">
<text>The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (), abbreviated as VChK (), and commonly known as the Cheka (), was the first Soviet secret police organization. It was established on by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Russian SFSR, and was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. By the end of the Russian Civil War in 1921, the Cheka had at least 200,000 personnel.

Ostensibly created to protect the October Revolution from &quot;class enemies&quot; such as the bourgeoisie and members of the clergy, the Cheka soon became a tool of repression wielded against all political opponents of the Bolshevik regime. The organization had responsibility for counterintelligence, oversight of the loyalty of the Red Army, and protection of the country&#x27;s borders, as well as the collection of human and technical intelligence. At the direction of Vladimir Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, torture, and executions without trial in what came to be known as the &quot;Red Terror&quot;. It policed the Gulag system of labor camps, conducted requisitions of food, and put down rebellions by workers and peasants. The Cheka was responsible for executing at least 50,000 to as many as 200,000 people, though estimates vary widely.

The Cheka, the first in a long succession of Soviet secret police agencies, established the security service as a major player in Soviet politics. It was dissolved in February 1922, and succeeded by the State Political Directorate (GPU). Throughout the Soviet era, members of the secret police were referred to as &quot;Chekists&quot;.

== Name ==
The official designation was All-Russian Extraordinary (or Emergency) Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage under the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the RSFSR (, &quot;Vserossiyskaya chrezvychaynaya komissiya po borbe s kontrrevolyutsiyey i sabotazhem pri Sovete narodnykh komisarov RSFSR&quot;).

In 1918 its name was changed, becoming All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Profiteering and Corruption.

A member of Cheka was called a &quot;chekist&quot; (). Also, the term &quot;chekist&quot; often referred to Soviet secret police throughout the Soviet period, despite official name changes over time. In &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, Alexander Solzhenitsyn recalls that &quot;zeks&quot; in the labor camps used &quot;old chekist&quot; as a mark of special esteem for particularly experienced camp administrators. The term is still found in use in Russia today (for example, President Vladimir Putin has been referred to in the Russian media as a &quot;chekist&quot; due to his career in the KGB and as head of the KGB&#x27;s successor, FSB).

The Chekists commonly dressed in black leather, including long flowing coats, reportedly after being issued such distinctive coats early in their existence. Western communists adopted this clothing fashion. The Chekists also often carried with them Greek-style worry beads made of amber, which had become &quot;fashionable among high officials during the time of the &#x27;cleansing&#x27;&quot;.
== History ==

In 1921, the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic (a branch of the Cheka) numbered at least 200,000. These troops policed labor camps, ran the Gulag system, conducted requisitions of food, and subjected political opponents to secret arrest, detention, torture and summary execution. They also put down rebellions and riots by workers or peasants, and mutinies in the desertion-plagued Red Army.

After 1922 Cheka groups underwent the first of a series of reorganizations; however the theme of a government dominated by &quot;the organs&quot; persisted indefinitely afterward, and Soviet citizens continued to refer to members of the various organs as Chekists.

=== Creation ===
In the first month and a half after the October Revolution (1917), the duty of &quot;extinguishing the resistance of exploiters&quot; was assigned to the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee (or PVRK). It represented a temporary body working under directives of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom) and Central Committee of RDSRP(b). The VRK created new bodies of government, organized food delivery to cities and the Army, requisitioned products from bourgeoisie, and sent its emissaries and agitators into provinces. One of its most important functions was the security of revolutionary order, and the fight against counterrevolutionary activity (see: Anti-Soviet agitation).

On December 1, 1917, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK or TsIK) reviewed a proposed reorganization of the VRK, and possible replacement of it. On December 5, the Petrograd VRK published an announcement of dissolution and transferred its functions to the department of TsIK for the fight against &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot;. On December 6, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom) strategized how to persuade government workers to strike across Russia. They decided that a special commission was needed to implement the &quot;most energetically revolutionary&quot; measures. Felix Dzerzhinsky (the Iron Felix) was appointed as Director and invited the participation of the following individuals: V. K. Averin, V.V Yakovlev, D. G. Yevseyev, N. A. Zhydelev, I. K. Ksenofontov, G. K. Ordjonikidze, Ya. Kh. Peters, K. A. Peterson, V. A. Trifonov.

On December 7, 1917, all invited except Zhydelev and Vasilevsky gathered in the Smolny Institute to discuss the competence and structure of the commission to combat counterrevolution and sabotage. The obligations of the commission were: &quot;to liquidate to the root all of the counterrevolutionary and sabotage activities and all attempts to them in all of Russia, to hand over counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs to the revolutionary tribunals, develop measures to combat them and relentlessly apply them in real-world applications. The commission should only conduct a preliminary investigation&quot;. The commission should also observe the press and counterrevolutionary parties, sabotaging officials and other criminals.

Three sections were created: informational, organizational, and a unit to combat counter-revolution and sabotage. Upon the end of the meeting, Dzerzhinsky reported to the Sovnarkom with the requested information. The commission was allowed to apply such measures of repression as &#x27;confiscation, deprivation of ration cards, publication of lists of enemies of the people etc.&#x27;&quot;. That day, Sovnarkom officially confirmed the creation of VCheKa. The commission was created not under the VTsIK as was previously anticipated, but rather under the Council of the People&#x27;s Commissars.

On December 8, 1917, some of the original members of the VCheka were replaced. Averin, Ordzhonikidze, and Trifonov were replaced by V. V. Fomin, S. E. Shchukin, Ilyin, and Chernov. On the meeting of December 8, the presidium of VChK was elected of five members, and chaired by Dzerzhinsky. The issues of &quot;speculation&quot; or profiteering, such as by black market grain sellers and &quot;corruption&quot; was raised at the same meeting, which was assigned to Peters to address and report with results to one of the next meetings of the commission. A circular, published on , gave the address of VCheka&#x27;s first headquarters as &quot;Petrograd, Gorokhovaya 2, 4th floor&quot;. On December 11, Fomin was ordered to organize a section to suppress &quot;speculation.&quot; And in the same day, VCheKa offered Shchukin to conduct arrests of counterfeiters.

In January 1918, a subsection of the anti-counterrevolutionary effort was created to police bank officials. The structure of VCheKa was changing repeatedly. By March 1918, when the organization came to Moscow, it contained the following sections: against counterrevolution, speculation, non-residents, and information gathering. By the end of 1918–1919, some new units were created: secretly operative, investigatory, of transportation, military (special), operative, and instructional. By 1921, it changed once again, forming the following sections: directory of affairs, administrative-organizational, secretly operative, economical, and foreign affairs.

=== First months ===
In the first months of its existence, VCheKa consisted of only 40 officials. It commanded a team of soldiers, the Sveaborgesky regiment, as well as a group of Red Guardsmen. On January 14, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered Dzerzhinsky to organize teams of &quot;energetic and ideological&quot; sailors to combat speculation. By the spring of 1918, the commission had several teams: in addition to the Sveaborge team, it had an intelligence team, a team of sailors, and a strike team. Through the winter of 1917–1918, all activities of VCheKa were centralized mainly in the city of Petrograd. It was one of several other commissions in the country which fought against counterrevolution, speculation, banditry, and other activities perceived as crimes. Other organizations included: the Bureau of Military Commissars, and an Army-Navy investigatory commission to attack the counterrevolutionary element in the Red Army, plus the Central Requisite and Unloading Commission to fight speculation. The investigation of counterrevolutionary or major criminal offenses was conducted by the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal. The functions of VCheKa were closely intertwined with the Commission of V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich, which beside the fight against wine pogroms was engaged in the investigation of most major political offenses (see: Bonch-Bruyevich Commission).

All results of its activities, VCheKa had either to transfer to the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal, or to dismiss. The control of the commission&#x27;s activity was provided by the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Justice (Narkomjust, at that time headed by Isaac Steinberg) and Internal Affairs (NKVD, at that time headed by Grigory Petrovsky). Although the VCheKa was officially an independent organization from the NKVD, its chief members such as Dzerzhinsky, Latsis, Unszlicht, and Uritsky (all main chekists), since November 1917 composed the collegiate of NKVD headed by Petrovsky. In November 1918, Petrovsky was appointed as head of the All-Ukrainian Central Military Revolutionary Committee during VCheKa&#x27;s expansion to provinces and front-lines. At the time of political competition between Bolsheviks and SRs (January 1918), Left SRs attempted to curb the rights of VCheKa and establish through the Narkomiust their control over its work. Having failed in attempts to subordinate the VCheKa to Narkomiust, the Left SRs tried to gain control of the Extraordinary Commission in a different way: they requested that the Central Committee of the party be granted the right to directly enter their representatives into the VCheKa. Sovnarkom recognized the desirability of including five representatives of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary faction of VTsIK. Left SRs were granted the post of a companion (deputy) chairman of VCheKa. However, Sovnarkom, in which the majority belonged to the representatives of RSDLP(b) retained the right to approve members of the collegium of the VCheKa.

Originally, members of the Cheka were exclusively Bolshevik; however, in January 1918, Left SRs also joined the organization. The Left SRs were expelled or arrested later in 1918, following the attempted assassination of Lenin by an SR, Fanni Kaplan.

=== Consolidation of VCheKa and National Establishment ===
By the end of January 1918, the Investigatory Commission of Petrograd Soviet (probably same as of Revtribunal) petitioned Sovnarkom to delineate the role of detection and judicial-investigatory organs. It offered to leave, for the VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich, only the functions of detection and suppression, while investigative functions entirely transferred to it. The Investigatory Commission prevailed. On January 31, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered to relieve VCheKa of the investigative functions, leaving for the commission only the functions of detection, suppression, and prevention of anti revolutionary crimes. At the meeting of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars on January 31, 1918, a merger of VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich was proposed. The existence of both commissions, VCheKa of Sovnarkom and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich of VTsIK, with almost the same functions and equal rights, became impractical. A decision followed two weeks later.

On February 23, 1918, VCheKa sent a radio telegram to all Soviets with a petition to immediately organize emergency commissions to combat counter-revolution, sabotage and speculation, if such commissions had not been yet organized. February 1918 saw the creation of local Extraordinary Commissions. One of the first founded was the Moscow Cheka. Sections and commissariats to combat counterrevolution were established in other cities. The Extraordinary Commissions arose, usually in the areas during the moments of the greatest aggravation of political situation. On February 25, 1918, as the counterrevolutionary organization &quot;Union of Front-liners&quot; was making advances, the executive committee of the Saratov Soviet formed a counter-revolutionary section. On March 7, 1918, because of the move from Petrograd to Moscow, the Petrograd Cheka was created. On March 9, a section for combating counterrevolution was created under the Omsk Soviet. Extraordinary commissions were also created in Penza, Perm, Novgorod, Cherepovets, Rostov, Taganrog. On March 18, VCheKa adopted a resolution, &quot;The Work of VCheKa on the All-Russian Scale&quot;, foreseeing the formation everywhere of Extraordinary Commissions after the same model, and sent a letter that called for the widespread establishment of the Cheka in combating counterrevolution, speculation, and sabotage. Establishment of provincial Extraordinary Commissions was largely completed by August 1918. In the Soviet Republic, there were 38 gubernatorial Chekas (Gubcheks) by this time.

On June 12, 1918, the All-Russian Conference of Cheka adopted the &quot;Basic Provisions on the Organization of Extraordinary Commissions&quot;. They set out to form Extraordinary Commissions not only at Oblast and Guberniya levels, but also at the large Uyezd Soviets. In August 1918, in the Soviet Republic had accounted for some 75 Uyezd-level Extraordinary Commissions. By the end of the year, 365 Uyezd-level Chekas were established. 

In 1918, the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission and the Soviets managed to establish a local Cheka apparatus. It included Oblast, Guberniya, Raion, Uyezd, and Volost Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. In addition, border security Chekas were included in the system of local Cheka bodies.

In the autumn of 1918, as consolidation of the political situation of the republic continued, a move toward elimination of Uyezd-, Raion-, and Volost-level Chekas, as well as the institution of Extraordinary Commissions was considered. On January 20, 1919, VTsIK adopted a resolution prepared by VCheKa, &quot;On the abolition of Uyezd Extraordinary Commissions&quot;. On January 16 the presidium of VCheKa approved the draft on the establishment of the Politburo at Uyezd militsiya. This decision was approved by the Conference of the Extraordinary Commission IV, held in early February 1920.

=== Other types of Cheka ===
On August 3, a VCheKa section for combating counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage on railways was created. On August 7, 1918, Sovnarkom adopted a decree on the organization of the railway section at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and crimes on railroads was passed under the jurisdiction of the railway section of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained in relation to the transportation sections only control and investigative functions.

The beginning of a systematic work of organs of VCheKa in RKKA refers to July 1918, the period of extreme tension of the civil war and class struggle in the country. On July 16, 1918, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars formed the Extraordinary Commission for combating counterrevolution at the Czechoslovak (Eastern) Front, led by M. I. Latsis. In the fall of 1918, Extraordinary Commissions to combat counterrevolution on the Southern (Ukraine) Front were formed. In late November, the Second All-Russian Conference of the Extraordinary Commissions accepted a decision after a report from I. N. Polukarov to establish at all frontlines, and army sections of the Cheka and granted them the right to appoint their commissioners in military units. On December 9, 1918, the collegiate (or presidium) of VCheKa had decided to form a military section, headed by M. S. Kedrov, to combat counterrevolution in the Army. In early 1919, the military control and the military section of VCheKa were merged into one body, the Special Section of the Republic, with Kedrov as head. On January 1, he issued an order to establish the Special Section. The order instructed agencies everywhere to unite the Military control and the military sections of Chekas and to form special sections of frontlines, armies, military districts, and guberniyas.

In November 1920 the Soviet of Labor and Defense created a Special Section of VCheKa for the security of the state border. On February 6, 1922, after the Ninth All-Russian Soviet Congress, the Cheka was dissolved by VTsIK, &quot;with expressions of gratitude for heroic work.&quot; It was replaced by the State Political Administration or GPU, a section of the NKVD of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Dzerzhinsky remained as chief of the new organization.
== Operations ==
=== Suppression of political opposition ===

As its name implied, the Extraordinary Commission had virtually unlimited powers and could interpret them in any way it wished. No standard procedures were ever set up, except that the commission was supposed to send the arrested to the Military-Revolutionary tribunals if outside of a war zone. This left an opportunity for a wide range of interpretations, as the whole country was in total chaos. At the direction of Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, and executions of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. In this, the Cheka said that they targeted &quot;class enemies&quot; such as the bourgeoisie, and members of the clergy.

Within a month, the Cheka had extended its repression to all political opponents of the communist government, including anarchists and others on the left. On April 11/12, 1918, some 26 anarchist political centres in Moscow were attacked. Forty anarchists were killed by Cheka forces, and about 500 were arrested and jailed after a pitched battle took place between the two groups. In response to the anarchists&#x27; resistance, the Cheka orchestrated a massive retaliatory campaign of repression, executions, and arrests against all opponents of the Bolshevik government, in what came to be known as &quot;Red Terror&quot;. The &quot;Red Terror&quot;, implemented by Dzerzhinsky on September 5, 1918, was vividly described by the Red Army journal &quot;Krasnaya Gazeta&quot;:

Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands, let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the blood of Lenin and Uritsky … let there be floods of blood of the bourgeoisie – more blood, as much as possible...&quot;

An early Bolshevik, Victor Serge described in his book &quot;Memoirs of a Revolutionary&quot;:

The Cheka was also used against Nestor Makhno&#x27;s Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine. After the Insurgent Army had served its purpose in aiding the Red Army to stop the Whites under Denikin, the Soviet communist government decided to eliminate the anarchist forces. In May 1919, two Cheka agents sent to assassinate Makhno were caught and executed.

Many victims of Cheka repression were &quot;bourgeois hostages&quot; rounded up and held in readiness for summary execution in reprisal for any alleged counter-revolutionary act. Wholesale, indiscriminate arrests became an integral part of the system. The Cheka used trucks disguised as delivery trucks, called &quot;Black Marias&quot;, for the secret arrest and transport of prisoners.

It was during the Red Terror that the Cheka, hoping to avoid the bloody aftermath of having half-dead victims writhing on the floor, developed a technique for execution known later by the German words &quot;&quot;Nackenschuss&quot; or &quot;&quot;Genickschuss&quot;, a shot to the nape of the neck, which caused minimal blood loss and instant death. The victim&#x27;s head was bent forward, and the executioner fired slightly downward at point-blank range. This had become the standard method used later by the NKVD to liquidate Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purge victims and others.

=== Persecution of deserters ===
It is believed that there were more than three million deserters from the Red Army in 1919 and 1920 . Approximately 500,000 deserters were arrested in 1919 and close to 800,000 in 1920, by troops of the &#x27;Special Punitive Department&#x27; of the Cheka, created to punish desertions. These troops were used to forcibly repatriate deserters, taking and shooting hostages to force compliance or to set an example.

In September 1918, according to &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;, in only twelve provinces of Russia, 48,735 deserters and 7,325 &quot;bandits&quot; were arrested, 1,826 were killed and 2,230 were executed. The exact identity of these individuals is confused by the fact that the Soviet Bolshevik government used the term &#x27;bandit&#x27; to cover ordinary criminals as well as armed and unarmed political opponents, such as the anarchists.

== Repression ==
=== Number of victims ===
Estimates on Cheka executions vary widely. The lowest figures (&quot;disputed below&quot;) are provided by Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s lieutenant Martyn Latsis, limited to RSFSR over the period 1918–1920:

*For the period 1918 – July 1919, covering only twenty provinces of central Russia:
::In 1918: 6,300; in 1919 (up to July): 2,089; Total: 8,389

*For the whole period 1918–19:
::In 1918: 6,185; in 1919: 3,456; Total: 9,641

*For the whole period 1918–20:
::In January–June 1918: 22; in July–December 1918: more than 6,000; in 1918–20: 12,733.

Experts generally agree these semi-official figures are vastly understated. Pioneering historian of the Red Terror Sergei Melgunov claims that this was done deliberately in an attempt to demonstrate the government&#x27;s humanity. For example, he refutes the claim made by Latsis that only 22 executions were carried out in the first six months of the Cheka&#x27;s existence by providing evidence that the true number was 884 executions. W. H. Chamberlin claims, &quot;It is simply impossible to believe that the Cheka only put to death 12,733 people in all of Russia up to the end of the civil war.&quot; Donald Rayfield concurs, noting that, &quot;Plausible evidence reveals that the actual numbers … vastly exceeded the official figures.&quot; Chamberlin provides the &quot;reasonable and probably moderate&quot; estimate of 50,000, while others provide estimates ranging up to 500,000. Several scholars put the number of executions at about 250,000. Some believe it is possible more people were murdered by the Cheka than died in battle. Historian James Ryan gives a modest estimate of 28,000 executions per year from December 1917 to February 1922.

Lenin himself seemed unfazed by the killings. On 12 January 1920, while addressing trade union leaders, he said: &quot;We did not hesitate to shoot thousands of people, and we shall not hesitate, and we shall save the On 14 May 1921, the Politburo, chaired by Lenin, passed a motion &quot;broadening the rights of the [Cheka] in relation to the use of the [death penalty].&quot;

=== Scholarly estimates ===
There is no consensus among the Western historians on the number of deaths from the Red Terror. One source gives estimates of 28,000 executions per year from December 1917 to February 1922. Estimates for the number of people shot during the initial period of the Red Terror are at least 10,000. Estimates for the whole period go for a low of 50,000 to highs of 140,000 and 200,000 executed. Most estimations for the number of executions in total put the number at about 100,000.

According to Vadim Erlikhman&#x27;s investigation, the number of the Red Terror&#x27;s victims is at least 1,200,000 people. According to Robert Conquest, a total of 140,000 people were shot in 1917–1922. Candidate of Historical Sciences Nikolay Zayats states that the number of people shot by the Cheka in 1918–1922 is about 37,300 people, shot in 1918–1921 by the verdicts of the tribunals – 14,200, i.e. about 50,000–55,000 people in total, although executions and atrocities were not limited to the Cheka, having been organized by the Red Army as well.

According to anti-Bolshevik Socialist Revolutionary Sergei Melgunov (1879–1956), at the end of 1919, the Special Investigation Commission to investigate the atrocities of the Bolsheviks estimated the number of deaths at 1,766,188 people in 1918–1919 only.

== Atrocities ==
The Cheka engaged in the widespread practice of torture. Depending on Cheka committees in various cities, the methods included: being skinned alive, scalped, &quot;crowned&quot; with barbed wire, impaled, crucified, hanged, stoned to death, tied to planks and pushed slowly into furnaces or tanks of boiling water, or rolled around naked in internally nail-studded barrels. Chekists reportedly poured water on naked prisoners in the winter-bound streets until they became living ice statues. Others beheaded their victims by twisting their necks until their heads could be torn off. The Cheka detachments stationed in Kiev would attach an iron tube to the torso of a bound victim and insert a rat in the tube closed off with wire netting, while the tube was held over a flame until the rat began gnawing through the victim&#x27;s guts in an effort to escape.

Women and children were also victims of Cheka terror. Women would sometimes be tortured and raped before being shot. Children between the ages of 8 and 13 were imprisoned and occasionally executed.

All of these atrocities were published on numerous occasions in &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestiya&quot;: January 26, 1919 &quot;Izvestiya&quot; #18 article &quot;Is it really a medieval imprisonment?&quot; («Неужели средневековый застенок?»); February 22, 1919 &quot;Pravda&quot; #12 publishes details of the Vladimir Cheka&#x27;s tortures, September 21, 1922 &quot;Socialist Herald&quot; publishes details of series of tortures conducted by the Stavropol Cheka (hot basement, cold basement, skull measuring, etc.).

The Chekists were also supplemented by the militarized Units of Special Purpose (the Party&#x27;s Spetsnaz or ).

Cheka was actively and openly utilizing kidnapping methods. With kidnapping methods, Cheka was able to extinguish numerous cases of discontent especially among the rural population. Among the notorious ones was the Tambov rebellion.

Villages were bombarded to complete annihilation, as in the case of Tretyaki, Novokhopersk uyezd, Voronezh Governorate. 

As a result of this relentless violence, more than a few Chekists ended up with psychopathic disorders, which Nikolai Bukharin said were &quot;an occupational hazard of the Chekist profession.&quot; Many hardened themselves to the executions by heavy drinking and drug use. Some developed a gangster-like slang for the verb to kill in an attempt to distance themselves from the killings, such as &#x27;shooting partridges&#x27;, or &#x27;sealing&#x27; a victim, or giving him a &quot;natsokal&quot; (onomatopoeia of the trigger action).

On November 30, 1992, by the initiative of the President of the Russian Federation the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation recognized the Red Terror as unlawful, which in turn led to the suspension of Communist Party of the RSFSR.

== Regional Chekas ==

Cheka departments were organized not only in big cities and guberniya seats, but also in each uyezd, at any front-lines and military formations. Nothing is known on what resources they were created. Many who were hired to head those departments were so-called &quot;nestlings of Alexander Kerensky&quot;.
;Moscow Cheka (1918–1919)
* Chairman – Felix Dzerzhynsky, Deputy – Yakov Peters (initially heading the Petrograd Department), other members – Shklovsky, Kneyfis, Tseystin, Razmirovich, Kronberg, Khaikina, Karlson, Shauman, Lentovich, Rivkin, Antonov, Delafabr, Tsytkin, G.Sverdlov, Bizensky, Yakov Blumkin, Aleksandrovich, Fines, Zaks, Yakov Goldin, Galpershtein, Kniggisen, Martin Latsis (later transfer (chief of jail), Fogel, Zakis, Shillenkus, Yanson).
;Petrograd Cheka (1918–1919)
* Chairman – Meinkman, Moisei Uritsky (reiller, Kozlovsky, Model, Rozmirovich, I.Diesporov, Iselevich, Krassikov, Bukhan, Merbis, Paykis, Anvelt.
;Kharkov Cheka
* Deych, Vikhman, Timofey, Vera (Dora) Grebenshchikova, Aleksandra (ag
* Ashykin.

== Popular culture ==
* The Cheka were popular staples in Soviet film and literature. This was partly due to a romanticization of the organisation in the post-Stalin period, and also because they provided a useful action/detection template. Films featuring the Cheka include Ostern&#x27;s &quot;Miles of Fire&quot;, Nikita Mikhalkov&#x27;s &quot;At Home among Strangers&quot;, the miniseries &quot;The Adjutant of His Excellency&quot;, and also &quot;Dead Season&quot; (starring Donatas Banionis), and the 1992 Russian drama film &quot;The Chekist&quot;.
* In Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, the detention and torture centers operated by the Republicans were named &quot;&quot;checas&quot; after the Soviet organization. Alfonso Laurencic was their promoter, ideologist and builder.
* Dzerzhinsky, who rarely drank, is said to have told Lenin – on an occasion in which he did so excessively – that secret police work could be done by &quot;only saints or scoundrels ... but now the saints are running away from me and I am left with the scoundrels&quot;.
* &quot;The Chekist&quot;, directed by Aleksandr Rogozhkin, is a 1992 French–Russian film based on a 1923 short story by Vladimir Zazubrin. It tells the story of a bloody work and downfall of a Soviet Cheka security official involved in mass executions during the Russian Civil War.
* &quot;The Soviet Story&quot;, a 2008 Latvian film, mentioned that Cheka is the Soviet terror machine, and Cheka is the &quot;teacher&quot; of Nazi gestapo.

== Legacy ==

Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy criticised the continuing celebration of the professional holiday of the old and the modern Russian security services on the anniversary of the creation of the Cheka, , with the assent of the Presidents of Russia. (Vladimir Putin, former KGB officer, chose not to change the date to another): &quot;The successors of the KGB still haven&#x27;t renounced anything; they even celebrate their professional holiday the same day, as during repression, on the 20th of December. It is as if the present intelligence and counterespionage services of Germany celebrated Gestapo Day. I can imagine how indignant our press would be!&quot;

<text>In morphology and syntax, a clitic ( , backformed from Greek &quot;leaning&quot; or &quot;enclitic&quot;) is a morpheme that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependent—always attached to a host. A clitic is pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at the phrase level. In other words, clitics have the &quot;form&quot; of affixes, but the distribution of function words.

Clitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly pronouns, determiners, or adpositions. Note that orthography is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic , meaning &quot;and&quot;) or separated by special characters such as hyphens or apostrophes (like the English clitic &quot;″s&quot; in &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; for &quot;it has&quot; or &quot;it is&quot;).

==Classification==
Clitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.

=== Proclitic ===

A proclitic appears before its host.

=== Enclitic ===

An enclitic appears after its host.
*Latin: Senatus &quot;Populus&quot;-que Romanus
*:&quot;Senate &quot;people&quot;-and Roman&quot; = &quot;The Senate and people of Rome&quot;
*Spanish: &quot;tener&quot;lo
*:&quot;to have it&quot;
*Ancient Greek: &quot;ánthrōpoí&quot; (-te) &quot;theoí&quot; -te
*:&quot;&quot;people&quot; (and) &quot;gods&quot; and&quot; = &quot;(both) men and gods&quot;
*Sanskrit: &quot;naro gajaś-ca&quot; नरो गजश्च i.e. &quot;naraḥ gajaḥ ca&quot; नरस् गजस् -च with sandhi
*:&quot;the man the elephant and&quot; = &quot;the man and the elephant&quot;
*Sanskrit: Namaste &lt; &quot;namaḥ&quot; + &quot;te&quot;, (Devanagari: नमः + -ते = नमस्ते), with sandhi change &quot;namaḥ&quot; &gt; &quot;namas&quot;.
*: &quot;bowing to you&quot;
*Czech: &quot;Nevím, chtělo-li by se mi si to tam však také vyzkoušet&quot;.
*:&quot;However (však), I do not know (&quot;nevím&quot;), if (-li) it would (by) want (&quot;chtělo se) to try (&quot;vyzkoušet si) it (to) to me (mi) there (tam) as well (&quot;také&quot;).&quot; (= However, I&#x27;m not sure if I would like to try it there as well.)
*Tamil: &quot;idu eṉ pū&quot; = இது என் பூ (This is my flower). With enclitic -vē, which indicates certainty, this sentence becomes
*:idu eṉ pūvē = இது என் பூவே (This is &quot;certainly&quot; my flower)
*Telugu: &quot;idi nā puvvu&quot; = ఇది నా పువ్వు (This is my flower). With enclitic -ē, which indicates certainty, this sentence becomes
*:Idi nā puvvē = ఇది నా పువ్వే (This is &quot;certainly&quot; my flower)
*Estonian: &quot;Rahagagi vaene&quot; means &quot;Poor even having money&quot;. Enclitic -gi with the comitative case turns &quot;with/having something&quot; into &quot;even with/having something&quot;. Without the enclitic, the saying would be &quot;rahaga vaene&quot;, which would mean that the predicate is &quot;poor, but has money&quot; (compared to &quot;poor even having money&quot;, having money won&#x27;t make a difference if the predicate is poor or not).

=== Endoclitic ===

Some authors postulate endoclitics, which split a stem and are inserted between the two elements. For example, they have been claimed to occur between the elements of bipartite verbs (equivalent to English verbs such as &quot;take part&quot;) in the Udi language. Endoclitics have also been claimed for Pashto and Degema.
However, other authors treat such forms as a sequence of clitics docked to the stem.

=== Mesoclitic ===

A &quot;mesoclitic&quot; is a type of clitic that occurs between the stem of a verb and its affixes. Mesoclisis is rare outside of formal standard Portuguese, where it is predominantly found. In Portuguese, mesoclitic constructions are typically formed with the infinitive form of the verb, a clitic pronoun, and a lexicalized tense affix.

For example, in the sentence &quot;conquistar-se-á&quot; (&quot;it will be conquered&quot;), the reflexive pronoun &quot;se&quot; appears between the stem &quot;conquistar&quot; and the future tense affix &quot;á&quot;. This placement of the clitic is characteristic of mesoclisis. Other examples include &quot;dá-lo-ei&quot; (&quot;I will give it&quot;) and &quot;matá-la-ia&quot; (&quot;he/she/it would kill her&quot;). These forms are typically found much more frequently in written Portuguese than in spoken varieties. Additionally, it is possible to use two clitics within a verb, as in &quot;dar-no-lo-á&quot; (&quot;he/she/it will give it to us&quot;) and &quot;dar-ta-ei&quot; (&quot;ta&quot; = &quot;te&quot; + &quot;a&quot;, &quot;I will give it/her to you&quot;).

This phenomenon is possible due to the historical evolution of the Portuguese synthetic future tense, which comes from the fusion of the infinitive form of the verb and the finite forms of the auxiliary verb &quot;haver&quot; (from Latin &quot;habēre&quot;). This origin explains why the clitic can appear between the verb stem and its tense marker, as the future tense was originally a separate word.

Colloquial Turkish exhibits an instance of a mesoclitic where the conjunction enclitic &quot;de&quot; (&quot;also, as well&quot;) is inserted after the gerundive suffix &quot;-e&quot; connecting the verb stem to the potential suffix &quot;-(e)bilmek&quot;, effectively rendering it in its original auxiliary verb form &quot;bilmek&quot; (to know). Suffixed auxiliary verbs cannot be converted into individual verbs in Standard Turkish, and the gerundive suffix is considered an inseparable part of them.

==Distinction==
One distinction drawn by some scholars divides the broad term &quot;clitics&quot; into two categories, simple clitics and special clitics. This distinction is, however, disputed.

=== Simple clitics ===
Simple clitics are free morphemes: can stand alone in a phrase or sentence. They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They derive meaning only from that &quot;host&quot;.

=== Special clitics ===
Special clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word upon which they depend: they exist as a part of their host. That form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that carries stress. Both variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, but the special clitic is bound to a host word and is unaccented.

==Properties==
Some clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of grammaticalization:

lexical item → clitic → affix

According to this model from Judith Klavans, an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a &quot;clitic&quot;. As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.

===Comparison with affixes===
Although the term &quot;clitic&quot; can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of &quot;clitic&quot; as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: that, like affixes, they cannot appear without a host, and can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term &quot;postlexical clitic&quot; is sometimes used for this sense of the term.

Given this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between clitics and affixes. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a diachronic point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic-affix distinction.

An affix syntactically and phonologically attaches to a base morpheme of a limited part of speech, such as a verb, to form a new word. A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the phrase or clause level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.
The results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called &quot;clitics&quot; actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed below).

Zwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:
* Clitics do not select their hosts. That is, they are &quot;promiscuous&quot;, attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place. Affixes do select their host: They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.
* Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary lexical gaps. Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words. (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with &quot;child&quot;.)
* Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies. That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language. Affixes may be irregular in this regard.
* Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies. That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic. Affixes may have irregular meanings.
* Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes). Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics. That is, an affix may appear between a stem and a clitic, but a clitic may not occur between a stem and an affix to that stem.
An example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive marker (&#x27;s) in English. Some linguists treat it as an affix, while others treat it as a clitic.

===Comparison with words===
Similar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.

*If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.
*If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.
*If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.
*If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.
*If a morpheme&#x27;s allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, &quot;a&quot; precedes indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.
*In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.

===Word order===
Clitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many Indo-European languages, for example, obey Wackernagel&#x27;s law (named after Jacob Wackernagel), which requires sentential clitics to appear in &quot;second position&quot;, after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:
*Latin had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: &quot;-enim&quot; &#x27;indeed, for&#x27;, &quot;-autem&quot; &#x27;but, moreover&#x27;, &quot;-vero&quot; &#x27;however&#x27;. For example, &quot;quis enim (quisenim) potest negare?&quot; (from Martial&#x27;s epigram LXIV, literally &quot;who indeed can deny [her riches]?&quot;). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of Caesar, Cicero and Sallust, these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.
* Russian has one: ли &quot;(li)&quot; which acts as a general question marker. It always appears in second position in its sentence or proposition, and if the interrogation concerns one word in particular, that word is placed before it:
** Он завтра придёт &quot;(on zavtra pridyot)&quot;, He&#x27;ll arrive tomorrow.
** Придёт ли он завтра?, Will he arrive tomorrow?
** Завтра ли он придёт?, Is it tomorrow that he&#x27;ll arrive?
** Он ли завтра придёт?, Is it he who&#x27;ll arrive tomorrow?
** Я не знаю, придёт ли он завтра &quot;(Ya nye znayu, pridyot li on zavtra)&quot;, I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;ll arrive tomorrow.

==Indo-European languages==

===Germanic languages===

==== English ====
English enclitics include the contracted versions of auxiliary verbs, as in &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;ve&quot;. Some also regard the possessive marker, as in &quot;The Queen of England&#x27;s crown&quot; as an enclitic, rather than a (phrasal) genitival inflection.

Some consider the infinitive marker &quot;to&quot; and the English articles &quot;a, an, the&quot; to be proclitics.

The negative marker &quot;-n&#x27;t&quot; as in &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot; etc. is typically considered a clitic that developed from the lexical item &quot;not&quot;. Linguists Arnold Zwicky and Geoffrey Pullum argue, however, that the form has the properties of an affix rather than a syntactically independent clitic.

====Other Germanic languages====
*Old Norse: The definite article was the enclitic , , (masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular), as in (&quot;the elf&quot;), (&quot;the gift&quot;), and (&quot;the tree&quot;), an abbreviated form of the independent pronoun , cognate of the German pronoun . It was fully declined for gender, case and number. Since both the noun and enclitic were declined, this led to &quot;double declension&quot;. The situation remains similar in modern Faroese and Icelandic, but in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the enclitics have become endings. Old Norse had also some enclitics of personal pronouns that were attached to verbs. These were (from ), (from ), (from ), and (from ). These could even be stacked up, e.g. (Hávamál, stanza 116).
*Dutch: definite article of neuter nouns and third person singular neuter pronoun, first person pronoun, second person singular pronoun, third person masculine singular pronoun, third person plural pronoun
* Plautdietsch: (&quot;Will he do it today?&quot;)
*Gothic: Sentence clitics appear in 2nd position in accordance with Wackernagel&#x27;s Law, including (yes–no question), (&quot;and&quot;), (&quot;then&quot;), (&quot;anything&quot;), for example (&quot;of thyself?&quot;). Multiple clitics could be stacked up, and split a preverb from its rest of the verb if the preverb comes at the beginning of the clause, e.g. (&quot;and then he seized them (fem.)&quot;), (&quot;whether he saw anything&quot;).
*Yiddish: The unspecified pronoun can be contracted to .

===Celtic languages===
In Cornish, the clitics &quot;ma&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;na&quot; are used after a noun and definite article to express &quot;this&quot; / &quot;that&quot; (singular) and &quot;these&quot; / &quot;those&quot; (plural). For example:
*&quot;an lyver&quot; &quot;the book&quot;, &quot;an lyver ma&quot; &quot;this book&quot;, &quot;an lyver na&quot; &quot;that book&quot;
*&quot;an lyvrow&quot; &quot;the books&quot;, &quot;an lyvrow ma&quot; &quot;these books&quot;, &quot;an lyvrow na&quot; &quot;those books&quot;

Irish Gaelic uses &quot;seo&quot; &quot;/&quot; &quot;sin&quot; as clitics in a similar way, also to express &quot;this&quot; / &quot;that&quot; and &quot;these&quot; / &quot;those&quot;. For example:
*&quot;an leabhar&quot; &quot;the book&quot;, &quot;an leabhar seo&quot; &quot;this book&quot;, &quot;an leabhar sin&quot; &quot;that book&quot;
*&quot;na leabhair&quot; &quot;the books&quot;, &quot;na leabhair seo&quot; &quot;these books&quot;, &quot;na leabhair sin&quot; &quot;those books&quot;

===Romance languages===
In Romance languages, some have treated the object personal pronoun forms as clitics, though they only attach to the verb they are the object of and so are affixes by the definition used here. There is no general agreement on the issue. For the Spanish object pronouns, for example:

*&quot;lo atamos&quot; (&quot;it tied-&quot; = &quot;we tied it&quot; or &quot;we tied him&quot;; can only occur with the verb it is the object of)
*&quot;dámelo&quot; (&quot;give me it&quot;)

Portuguese allows object suffixes before the conditional and future suffixes of the verbs:

*&quot;Ela levá-lo-ia&quot; (&quot;She take-it-would&quot; – &quot;She would take it&quot;).
*&quot;Eles dar-no-lo-ão&quot; (&quot;They give-us-it-will&quot; – &quot;They will give it to us&quot;).

Colloquial Portuguese allows ser to be conjugated as a verbal clitic adverbial adjunct to emphasize the importance of the phrase compared to its context, or with the meaning of &quot;really&quot; or &quot;in truth&quot;:

*&quot;Ele estava era gordo&quot; (&quot;He was was fat&quot; – &quot;He was very fat&quot;).
*&quot;Ele ligou é para Paula&quot; (&quot;He phoned is Paula&quot; – &quot;He phoned Paula (&quot;with emphasis&quot;)&quot;).

Note that this clitic form is only for the verb ser and is restricted to only third-person singular conjugations. It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It does not need to concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the second example, and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.

===Proto-Indo-European===
In the Indo-European languages, some clitics can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European: for example, is the original form of Sanskrit &quot;&quot; (&quot;-ca&quot;), Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;-te&quot;), and Latin &quot;&quot;.
*Latin: &quot;&quot; &quot;and&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;or&quot;, &quot;&quot; (yes–no question)
*Greek: &quot;&quot; &quot;and&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;but&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;for&quot; (in a logical argument), &quot;&quot; &quot;therefore&quot;

===Slavic languages===
*Russian: (yes–no question), (emphasis), то (emphasis), &quot;not&quot; (proclitic), (subjunctive)
* Czech: special clitics: weak personal and reflexive pronouns (&quot;mu&quot;, &quot;him&quot;), certain auxiliary verbs (&quot;by&quot;, &quot;would&quot;), and various short particles and adverbs (&quot;tu&quot;, &quot;here&quot;; &quot;ale&quot;, &quot;though&quot;). &quot;Nepodařilo by se mi mu to dát&quot; &quot;I would not succeed in giving it to him&quot;. In addition there are various simple clitics including short prepositions.
* Polish: &quot;&quot; (conditional mood particle), &quot;&quot; (reflexive, also modifies meaning of certain verbs), &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (emphasis), &quot;-m, -ś, -śmy, -ście&quot; (personal auxiliary), &quot;mi, ci, cię, go, mu&quot; &amp;c. (unstressed personal pronouns in oblique cases)

==== Serbo-Croatian ====
Serbo-Croatian: the reflexive pronoun forms &quot;si&quot; and &quot;se&quot;, &quot;li&quot; (yes–no question), unstressed present and aorist tense forms of &quot;biti&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;; &quot;sam, si, je, smo, ste, su&quot;; and &quot;bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi&quot;, for the respective tense), unstressed personal pronouns in genitive (&quot;me, te, ga, je, nas, vas, ih&quot;), dative (&quot;mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im&quot;) and accusative (&quot;me, te, ga (nj), je (ju), nas, vas, ih&quot;), and unstressed present tense of &quot;htjeti&quot; (&quot;want/will&quot;; &quot;ću, ćeš, će, ćemo, ćete, će&quot;)

These clitics follow the first stressed word in the sentence or clause in most cases, which may have been inherited from Proto-Indo-European (see Wackernagel&#x27;s Law), even though many of the modern clitics became cliticised much more recently in the language (e.g. auxiliary verbs or the accusative forms of pronouns). In subordinate clauses and questions, they follow the connector and/or the question word respectively.

Examples (clitics – &quot;sam&quot; &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;biste&quot; &quot;you would (pl.)&quot;, &quot;mi&quot; &quot;to me&quot;, &quot;vam&quot; &quot;to you (pl.)&quot;, &quot;ih&quot; &quot;them&quot;):

* &quot;Pokažite mi ih.&quot; &quot;Show (pl.) them to me.&quot; 
* &quot;Pokazao sam vam ih jučer.&quot; &quot;I showed them to you (pl.) yesterday.&quot; 
* &quot;Sve sam vam ih (jučer) pokazao. / Sve sam vam ih pokazao (jučer).&quot; &quot;I showed all of them to you (yesterday).&quot; (focus on &quot;all&quot;) 
* &quot;Jučer sam vam ih (sve) pokazao.&quot; &quot;I showed (all of) them to you yesterday.&quot; (focus on &quot;yesterday&quot;) 
* &quot;Znam da sam vam ih već pokazao.&quot; &quot;I know that I have already shown them to you.&quot; 
* &quot;Zašto sam vam ih jučer pokazao?&quot; &quot;Why did I show them to you yesterday?&quot; 
* &quot;Zar sam vam ih jučer pokazao?&quot; &quot;Did I (really) show them to you yesterday?&quot; 
* &quot;Kad biste mi ih sada dali...&quot; &quot;If you (pl.) gave them to me now...&quot; (lit. If you-would to-me them now give-&quot;participle&quot;...) 
* &quot;Što sam god vidio...&quot; &quot;Whatever I saw...&quot; (lit. What I-am ever see-&quot;participle&quot;...)

In certain rural dialects this rule is (or was until recently) very strict, whereas elsewhere various exceptions occur. These include phrases containing conjunctions (e. g. &quot;Ivan i Ana&quot; &quot;Ivan and Ana&quot;), nouns with a genitival attribute (e. g. &quot;vrh brda&quot; &quot;the top of the hill&quot;), proper names and titles and the like (e. g. &quot;(gospođa) Ivana Marić&quot; &quot;(Mrs) Ivana Marić&quot;, &quot;grad Zagreb&quot; &quot;the city (of) Zagreb&quot;), and in many local varieties clitics are hardly ever inserted into any phrases (e. g. &quot;moj najbolji prijatelj&quot; &quot;my best friend&quot;, &quot;sutra ujutro&quot; &quot;tomorrow morning&quot;). In cases like these, clitics normally follow the initial phrase, although some Standard grammar handbooks recommend that they should be placed immediately after the verb (many native speakers find this unnatural).

Examples: 
* &quot;Ja smo i on otišli u grad.&quot; &quot;He and I went to town.&quot; (lit. I are and him gone to town) – this is dialectal. 
* &quot;Ja i on smo otišli u grad.&quot; – commonly heard
* &quot;Ja i on otišli smo u grad.&quot; – prescribed by some standard grammars
* &quot;Moja mu je starija sestra to rekla.&quot; &quot;My elder sister told him that.&quot; (lit. my to-him is elder sister that say-&quot;participle&quot;) – standard and usual in many dialects 
* &quot;Moja starija sestra mu je to rekla.&quot; – common in many dialects

Clitics are however never inserted after the negative particle &quot;ne&quot;, which always precedes the verb in Serbo-Croatian, or after prefixes (earlier preverbs), and the interrogative particle &quot;li&quot; always immediately follows the verb. Colloquial interrogative particles such as &quot;da li&quot;, &quot;dal&quot;, &quot;jel&quot; appear in sentence-initial position and are followed by clitics (if there are any).

Examples: 
* &quot;Ne vidim te.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) see you.&quot; 
* &quot;Dovedite ih.&quot; &quot;Bring them (over here)!&quot; (a prefixed verb: &quot;do+vedite&quot;) 
* &quot;Vidiš li me?&quot; &quot;Do/can you see me?&quot; 
* &quot;Vidiš li sestru?&quot; &quot;Do you see the sister?&quot; (It is impossible to say, e. g. **Sestru li vidiš?, although &quot;Sestru vidiš.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s the sister that you see.&quot; is natural) 
* &quot;Jel (me) vidiš?&quot; &quot;Do/Can you see (me)?&quot; (colloquial)

==Other languages==
*Arabic: Suffixes standing for direct object pronouns and/or indirect object pronouns (as found in Indo-European languages) are suffixed to verbs, possessive determiners are suffixed to nouns, and pronouns are suffixed to particles.
*Australian Aboriginal languages: Many Australian languages use bound pronoun enclitics to mark inanimate arguments and, in many pro-drop languages like Warlpiri, animate arguments as well. Pronominal enclitics may also mark possession and other less common argument structures like causal and reciprocal arguments (see Pintupi). In some Australian languages, case markers also seem to operate like special clitics since they are distributed at the phrasal instead of word level (indeed, clitics have been referred to as &quot;phrasal affixes&quot;) see for example in Wangkatja.
*Finnish: Finnish has seven clitics, which change according to the vowel harmony: &quot;-kO&quot; (&quot;-ko ~ -kö&quot;), &quot;-kA&quot; (&quot;-ka ~ -kä&quot;), &quot;-kin&quot;, &quot;-kAAn&quot; (&quot;-kaan ~ -kään&quot;), &quot;-pA&quot; (&quot;-pa&quot; ~ &quot;-pä&quot;), &quot;-hAn&quot; (&quot;-han ~ -hän&quot;) and &quot;-s&quot;. One word can have multiple clitics attached to it: &quot;onkohan?&quot; &quot;I wonder if it is?&quot;
**&quot;-kO&quot; attached to a verb makes it a question. It is used in yes/no questions: &quot;Katsot televisiota&quot; &quot;You are watching television&quot; → &quot;Katsotko televisiota?&quot; &quot;Are you watching television?&quot;. It can also be added to words that are not verbs but the emphasis changes: &quot;Televisiotako katsot?&quot; &quot;Is it television you&#x27;re watching?&quot;, &quot;Sinäkö katsot televisiota?&quot; &quot;Is it you who is watching television?&quot;
**&quot;-kA&quot; gives the host word a colloquial tone: &quot;miten&quot; ~ &quot;mitenkä&quot; (&quot;how&quot;). When attached to a negative verb it corresponds with &quot;and&quot;: &quot;En pidä mansikoista enkä mustikoista&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t like strawberries nor blueberries&quot;. It can also make a negative verb stronger: &quot;Enkä tule!&quot; &quot;I definitely won&#x27;t come!&quot;
**&quot;-kin&quot; is a focus particle, often used instead of &quot;myös&quot; (&quot;also&quot; / &quot;as well&quot;): &quot;Minäkin olin siellä&quot; &quot;I was there, too&quot;. Depending on the context when attached to a verb it can also express that something happened according to the plan or as a surprise and not according to the plan. It can also make exclamations stronger. It can be attached to several words in the same sentence, changing the focus of the host word, but can only appear once per sentence: &quot;Minäkin olin siellä&quot; (&quot;I, too, was there&quot;), &quot;Minä olinkin siellä&quot; (&quot;Surprisingly, I was there&quot; or &quot;As expected, I was there&quot;), &quot;Minä olin sielläkin&quot; (&quot;I was there as well&quot;)
**&quot;-kAAn&quot; is also a focus particle and it corresponds with &quot;-kin&quot; in negative sentences: &quot;Minäkään en ollut siellä&quot; &quot;I wasn&#x27;t there either&quot;. Like &quot;-kin&quot; it can be attached to several host words in the same sentence. The only word it cannot be attached to is a negative verb. In questions it acts as a confirmation, like the word &quot;again&quot; in English: &quot;Missä sanoitkaan asuvasi?&quot; &quot;Where did you say you lived again?&quot;
**&quot;-pA&quot; is a tone particle which can either add an arguing or patronising tone, or strengthen the host word: &quot;Minäpä tiedän paremmin!&quot; &quot;Well, I know better!&quot;, &quot;Onpa kaunis kissa!&quot; &quot;Wow what a beautiful cat!&quot;, &quot;No, kerropa, miksi teit sen!&quot; &quot;Well, go ahead and tell why you did it&quot;
**&quot;-hAn&quot; is also a tone particle. In interrogative sentences it can make the question more polite and not as pressing: &quot;Onkohan isäsi kotona?&quot; &quot;(I wonder if your dad is at home?&quot; In command phrases it makes the command softer: &quot;Tulehan tänne&quot; &quot;Come here you&quot;. It can also make a sentence more explanatory, make a claim more self-evident, express that something happened according to one&#x27;s expectations, or that something came as a surprise etc. &quot;Pekka tuntee minut, onhan hän minun opettajani&quot; &quot;Pekka knows me, he is my teacher after all&quot;, &quot;Kaikkihan niin tekevät&quot; &quot;Everyone does that after all&quot;, &quot;Maijahan se siinä!&quot; &quot;Well, if it isn&#x27;t Maija!&quot; &quot;Luulin, ettette osaisi, mutta tehän puhutte suomea hyvin&quot; &quot;I thought you wouldn&#x27;t be able to, but you speak Finnish well&quot;
** &quot;-s&quot; is a tone particle as well. It can also be used as a mitigating or softening phrase like &quot;-hAn&quot;: &quot;Annikos se on?&quot; &quot;Oh, but isn&#x27;t it Anni?&quot;, &quot;Tules tänne&quot; &quot;Come here, you&quot;, &quot;Miksikäs ei?&quot; &quot;Well, why not?&quot;, &quot;Paljonkos kello on?&quot; &quot;Say, what time it is?&quot;
*Ganda: &quot;-nga&quot; attached to a verb to form the progressive; &quot;-wo&quot; &#x27;in&#x27; (also attached to a verb)
*Georgian: &quot;-o&quot; (2nd and 3rd person speakers) and &quot;-metki&quot; (1st person speakers) is added to the end of a sentence to show reported speech. Examples: &quot;K&#x27;atsma miutxra, xval gnaxe-o&quot; = The man told me that he would see you tomorrow (Literally, &quot;The man told me, tomorrow I see you [reported]&quot;) vs. &quot;K&#x27;atss vutxari, xval gnaxe-metki =&quot; I told the man that I would see you tomorrow (Literally, &quot;To man I told, tomorrow I see you [first person reported]).
*Hungarian: the marker of indirect questions is &quot;-e:&quot; &quot;Nem tudja még, jön-e.&quot; &quot;He doesn&#x27;t know yet if he&#x27;ll come.&quot; This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. &quot;Is&quot; (&quot;as well&quot;) and &quot;se&quot; (&quot;not... either&quot;) also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: &quot;Ő is jön.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;ll come too.&quot; &quot;Ő sem jön.&quot; &quot;He won&#x27;t come, either.&quot;
*Korean: The copula (&quot;ida&quot;) and the adjectival (&quot;hada&quot;), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. , &quot;neun&quot;). However, alternative analysis suggests that the nominal particles do not function as clitics, but as phrasal affixes.
*Somali: pronominal clitics, either subject or object clitics, are required in Somali. These exist as simple clitics postponed to the noun they apply to. Lexical arguments can be omitted from sentences, but pronominal clitics cannot be. 
*Turkish: there are some clitics which are independent words, while others are suffixes: the clitic &quot;mI&quot; (realised as &quot;mi, mı, mu,&quot; or &quot;mü&quot; depending on vowel harmony) is used to form yes/no questions, such as &quot;iyi mi?&quot; &quot;is it good?&quot;. It can be inflected by person: &quot;iyi misin?&quot; &quot;are you good?&quot;. The clitic &quot;dA&quot; (realised as &quot;da&quot; or &quot;de&quot;) means &quot;too&quot;, &quot;as well&quot; or &quot;also&quot;: &quot;Sen de iyi misin?&quot; means &quot;are you also good?&quot;. However, this word must be pronounced and written carefully, as the -&quot;dA&quot; (another clitic) suffix creates the locative case: &quot;o da&quot; means &quot;him too&quot;, but &quot;oda&quot; means &quot;room&quot;; &quot;oda da&quot; means &quot;the room too&quot; and &quot;odada&quot; means in the room. Verbal clitics also exist, for pronouns as well as for certain meanings like &quot;if&quot; (&quot;-sa&quot;) or &quot;can&quot; (&quot;-Abil&quot;). Pronominal clitics make pronouns redundant in most situations.

<text>In formal language theory, a context-free grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar whose production rules 
can be applied to a nonterminal symbol regardless of its context.
In particular, in a context-free grammar, each production rule is of the form

:formula_1

with formula_2 a &quot;single&quot; nonterminal symbol, and formula_3 a string of terminals and/or nonterminals (formula_3 can be empty). Regardless of which symbols surround it, the single nonterminal formula_2 on the left hand side can always be replaced by formula_3 on the right hand side. This distinguishes it from a context-sensitive grammar, which can have production rules in the form formula_7 with formula_2 a nonterminal symbol and formula_3, formula_10, and formula_11 strings of terminal and/or nonterminal symbols.

A formal grammar is essentially a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a given formal language. Production rules are simple replacements. For example, the first rule in the picture,

:formula_12

replaces formula_13 with formula_14. There can be multiple replacement rules for a given nonterminal symbol. The language generated by a grammar is the set of all strings of terminal symbols that can be derived, by repeated rule applications, from some particular nonterminal symbol (&quot;start symbol&quot;).
Nonterminal symbols are used during the derivation process, but do not appear in its final result string.

Languages generated by context-free grammars are known as context-free languages (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The language equality question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is undecidable.

Context-free grammars arise in linguistics where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were invented by the linguist Noam Chomsky for this purpose. By contrast, in computer science, as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) called the document type definition.

In linguistics, some authors use the term phrase structure grammar to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from dependency grammars. In computer science, a popular notation for context-free grammars is Backus–Naur form, or BNF.

== Background ==

Since at least the time of the ancient Indian scholar Pāṇini, linguists have described the grammars of languages in terms of their block structure, and described how sentences are recursively built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements. An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:
: &quot;John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the grocery store.&quot;
can be logically parenthesized (with the logical metasymbols [ ]) as follows:
: [John[, [whose [blue car]] [was [in [the garage]]],]] [walked [to [the [grocery store]]]].
A context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the &quot;block structure&quot; of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as agreement and reference are not part of the context-free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.

Context-free grammars are a special form of Semi-Thue systems that in their general form date back to the work of Axel Thue.

The formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by Noam Chomsky, and also their classification as a special type of formal grammar (which he called phrase-structure grammars). Some authors, however, reserve the term for more restricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy: context-sensitive grammars or context-free grammars. In a broader sense, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars. The defining trait of phrase structure grammars is thus their adherence to the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation of dependency grammars. In Chomsky&#x27;s generative grammar framework, the syntax of natural language was described by context-free rules combined with transformation rules.

Block structure was introduced into computer programming languages by the Algol project (1957–1960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as Backus–Naur form, after two members of the Algol language design committee. The &quot;block structure&quot; aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the &quot;semantics&quot; of the language.

Context-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient parsing algorithms that, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An Earley parser is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used LR and LL parsers are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.

== Formal definitions ==
A context-free grammar is defined by the 4-tuple formula_15, 
where
# is a finite set; each element formula_16 is called &quot;a nonterminal character&quot; or a &quot;variable&quot;. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by .
# is a finite set of &quot;terminal&quot;s, disjoint from , which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar .
# is a finite relation in formula_17, where the asterisk represents the Kleene star operation. The members of are called the &quot;(rewrite) rule&quot;s or &quot;production&quot;s of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a )
# is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of .

=== Production rule notation ===
A production rule in is formalized mathematically as a pair formula_18, where formula_19 is a nonterminal and formula_20 is a string of variables and/or terminals; rather than using ordered pair notation, production rules are usually written using an arrow operator with formula_3 as its left hand side and as its right hand side:
formula_22.

It is allowed for to be the empty string, and in this case it is customary to denote it by ε. The form formula_23 is called an -production.

It is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | (the vertical bar) to separate them. Rules formula_24 and formula_25 can hence be written as formula_26. In this case, formula_27 and formula_28 are called the first and second alternative, respectively.

=== Rule application ===
For any strings formula_29, we say directly yields , written as formula_30, if formula_31 with formula_19 and formula_33 such that formula_34 and formula_35. Thus, is a result of applying the rule formula_36 to .

=== Repetitive rule application ===
For any strings formula_37 we say &quot;yields&quot; or is &quot;derived&quot; from if there is a positive integer and strings formula_38 such that formula_39. This relation is denoted formula_40, or formula_41 in some textbooks. If formula_42, the relation formula_43 holds. In other words, formula_44 and formula_45 are the reflexive transitive closure (allowing a string to yield itself) and the transitive closure (requiring at least one step) of formula_46, respectively.

=== Context-free language ===
The language of a grammar formula_15 is the set
:formula_48
of all terminal-symbol strings derivable from the start symbol.

A language is said to be a context-free language (CFL), if there exists a CFG , such that formula_49.

Non-deterministic pushdown automata recognize exactly the context-free languages.

== Examples ==

=== Words concatenated with their reverse ===

The grammar formula_50, with productions
:,

is context-free. It is not proper since it includes an ε-production. A typical derivation in this grammar is
This makes it clear that 
formula_51. 
The language is context-free; however, it can be proved that it is not regular.

If the productions
:,

are added, a context-free grammar for the set of all palindromes over the alphabet is obtained.

=== Well-formed parentheses ===
The canonical example of a context-free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are
:,

The first rule allows the S symbol to multiply; the second rule allows the S symbol to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.

=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===

A second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:
:
:

with terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.

The following sequence can be derived in that grammar:

=== Matching pairs ===
In a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with brackets. The simplest example:
:

This grammar generates the language formula_52, which is not regular (according to the pumping lemma for regular languages).

The special character ε stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to
:

we obtain a grammar generating the language formula_53 instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.

=== Distinct number of a&#x27;s and b&#x27;s ===

A context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a&#x27;s and b&#x27;s:
:
:
Here, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with more a&#x27;s than b&#x27;s, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more b&#x27;s than a&#x27;s and the nonterminal V generates all strings with an equal number of a&#x27;s and b&#x27;s. Omitting the third alternative in the rules for T and U does not restrict the grammar&#x27;s language.

=== Second block of b&#x27;s of double size ===

Another example of a non-regular language is formula_54. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:
:

=== First-order logic formulas ===

The formation rules for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.

== Examples of languages that are not context free ==

In contrast to well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets in the previous section, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced &quot;disregarding the other&quot;, where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:

or

The fact that this language is not context free can be proven using pumping lemma for context-free languages and a proof by contradiction, observing that all words of the form 
formula_55
should belong to the language. This language belongs instead to a more general class and can be described by a conjunctive grammar, which in turn also includes other non-context-free languages, such as the language of all words of the form
formula_56.

== Regular grammars ==

Every regular grammar is context-free, but not all context-free grammars are regular. The following context-free grammar, for example, is also regular.
:

The terminals here are and , while the only nonterminal is .
The language described is all nonempty strings of formula_57s and formula_58s that end in formula_57.

This grammar is regular: no rule has more than one nonterminal in its right-hand side, and each of these nonterminals is at the same end of the right-hand side.

Every regular grammar corresponds directly to a nondeterministic finite automaton, so we know that this is a regular language.

Using vertical bars, the grammar above can be described more tersely as follows:

== Derivations and syntax trees ==
A &quot;derivation&quot; of a string for a grammar is a sequence of grammar rule applications that transform the start symbol into the string.
A derivation proves that the string belongs to the grammar&#x27;s language.

A derivation is fully determined by giving, for each step:
* the rule applied in that step
* the occurrence of its left-hand side to which it is applied
For clarity, the intermediate string is usually given as well.

For instance, with the grammar:
# 

the string

can be derived from the start symbol with the following derivation:
: (by rule 1. on )
: (by rule 1. on the second )
: (by rule 2. on the first )
: (by rule 2. on the second )
: (by rule 3. on the third )

Often, a strategy is followed that deterministically chooses the next nonterminal to rewrite:

* in a &quot;leftmost derivation&quot;, it is always the leftmost nonterminal;
* in a &quot;rightmost derivation&quot;, it is always the rightmost nonterminal.

Given such a strategy, a derivation is completely determined by the sequence of rules applied. For instance, one leftmost derivation of the same string is
: (by rule 1 on the leftmost )
: (by rule 2 on the leftmost )
: (by rule 1 on the leftmost )
: (by rule 2 on the leftmost )
: (by rule 3 on the leftmost ),

which can be summarized as

:rule 1
:rule 2
:rule 1
:rule 2
:rule 3.

One rightmost derivation is:
: (by rule 1 on the rightmost )
: (by rule 1 on the rightmost )
: (by rule 3 on the rightmost )
: (by rule 2 on the rightmost )
: (by rule 2 on the rightmost ),

which can be summarized as

:rule 1
:rule 1
:rule 3
:rule 2
:rule 2.

The distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most parsers the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example LL parsers and LR parsers.

A derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string &quot;1 + 1 + a&quot; is derived according to the leftmost derivation outlined above, the structure of the string would be:

:{{Math|{{1}&quot;S&quot; + {{1}&quot;S&quot; + {&quot;a&quot;}&quot;S&quot;}&quot;S&quot;}&quot;S&quot;}}

where {{Math|{...}&quot;S&quot;}} indicates a substring recognized as belonging to {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}}. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:

This tree is called a &quot;parse tree&quot; or &quot;concrete syntax tree&quot; of the string, by contrast with the abstract syntax tree. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same parse tree; however, there is another rightmost derivation of the same string

:{{Math|&quot;S&quot;}}
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot;}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + &quot;a&quot;}} (by rule 3 on the rightmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot; + &quot;a&quot;}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + 1 + &quot;a&quot;}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ 1 + 1 + &quot;a&quot;}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}}),

which defines a string with a different structure

:{{Math|{{{1}&quot;S&quot; + {1}&quot;S&quot;}&quot;S&quot; + {&quot;a&quot;}&quot;S&quot;}&quot;S&quot;}}

and a different parse tree:

Note however that both parse trees can be obtained by both leftmost and rightmost derivations. For example, the last tree can be obtained with the leftmost derivation as follows:

:{{Math|&quot;S&quot;}}
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot;}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot;}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ 1 + &quot;S&quot; + &quot;S&quot;}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ 1 + 1 + &quot;S&quot;}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}})
:{{Math|→ 1 + 1 + &quot;a&quot;}} (by rule 3 on the leftmost {{Math|&quot;S&quot;}}),

If a string in the language of the grammar has more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an &quot;ambiguous grammar&quot;. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called &quot;inherently ambiguous languages&quot;.

== Normal forms ==
Every context-free grammar with no ε-production has an equivalent grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a grammar in Greibach normal form. &quot;Equivalent&quot; here means that the two grammars generate the same language.

The especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky normal form grammars has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky normal form to construct a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the CYK algorithm).

==Closure properties==
Context-free languages are closed under the various operations, that is, if the languages &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are 
context-free, so is the result of the following operations:

* union &quot;K&quot; ∪ &quot;L&quot;; concatenation &quot;K&quot; ∘ &quot;L&quot;; Kleene star &quot;L&quot;*{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131}}
* substitution (in particular homomorphism){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131-132|loc=Theorem 6.2}}
* inverse homomorphism{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=132-134|loc=Theorem 6.3}}
* intersection with a regular language{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=135-136|loc=Theorem 6.5}}

They are not closed under general intersection (hence neither under complementation) and set difference.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=134-135|loc=Theorem 6.4}}

== Decidable problems ==

The following are some decidable problems about context-free grammars.

=== Parsing ===

The parsing problem, checking whether a given word belongs to the language given by a context-free grammar, is decidable, using one of the general-purpose parsing algorithms:
* CYK algorithm (for grammars in Chomsky normal form)
* Earley parser
* GLR parser
* LL parser (only for the proper subclass of LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammars)
Context-free parsing for Chomsky normal form grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to Boolean matrix multiplication, thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2.3728639).{{efn|In Valiant&#x27;s papers, &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2.81) is given, the then best known upper bound. See Matrix multiplication#Computational complexity for bound improvements since then.}} Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3−ε) Boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3−3ε) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.

=== Reachability, productiveness, nullability ===

A nonterminal symbol formula_60 is called &quot;productive&quot;, or &quot;generating&quot;, if there is a derivation formula_61 for some string formula_62 of terminal symbols. formula_60 is called &quot;reachable&quot; if there is a derivation formula_64 for some strings formula_65 of nonterminal and terminal symbols from the start symbol. formula_60 is called &quot;useless&quot; if it is unreachable or unproductive. formula_60 is called &quot;nullable&quot; if there is a derivation formula_68. A rule formula_69 is called an &quot;ε-production&quot;. A derivation formula_70 is called a &quot;cycle&quot;.

Algorithms are known to eliminate from a given grammar, without changing its generated language,
* unproductive symbols,{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|loc=Lemma 4.1|p=88}}{{efn|For regular tree grammars, Aiken and Murphy give a fixpoint algorithm to detect unproductive nonterminals.}}
* unreachable symbols,{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|loc=Lemma 4.2|p=89}}{{sfn|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2006|loc=Theorem 7.2, Section 7.1 |p=255}}
* ε-productions, with one possible exception,{{efn|If the grammar can generate formula_71, a rule formula_72 cannot be avoided.}}{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|loc=Theorem 4.3|p=90}} and
* cycles.{{efn|This is a consequence of the unit-production elimination theorem in {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=91|loc=Theorem 4.4}}.}}

In particular, an alternative containing a useless nonterminal symbol can be deleted from the right-hand side of a rule.
Such rules and alternatives are called &quot;useless&quot;.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Motwani|Ullman|2006|p=256|loc=Section 7.1.1}}

In the depicted example grammar, the nonterminal &quot;D&quot; is unreachable, and &quot;E&quot; is unproductive, while &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; causes a cycle.
Hence, omitting the last three rules does not change the language generated by the grammar, nor does omitting the alternatives &quot;| &quot;Cc&quot; | &quot;Ee&quot;&quot; from the right-hand side of the rule for &quot;S&quot;.

A context-free grammar is said to be &quot;proper&quot; if it has neither useless symbols nor ε-productions nor cycles. 
Combining the above algorithms, every context-free grammar not generating ε can be transformed into a weakly equivalent proper one.

=== Regularity and LL(&quot;k&quot;) checks ===

It is decidable whether a given &quot;grammar&quot; is a regular grammar,{{efn|This is easy to see from the grammar definitions.}} as well as whether it is an LL(&quot;k&quot;) grammar for a given &quot;k&quot;≥0.{{rp|233}} If &quot;k&quot; is not given, the latter problem is undecidable.{{rp|252}}

Given a context-free grammar, it is not decidable whether its language is regular, nor whether it is an LL(&quot;k&quot;) language for a given &quot;k&quot;.{{rp|254}}

=== Emptiness and finiteness ===

There are algorithms to decide whether the language of a given context-free grammar is empty, as well as whether it is finite.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137-138|loc=Theorem 6.6}}

== Undecidable problems ==
Some questions that are undecidable for wider classes of grammars become decidable for context-free grammars; e.g. the emptiness problem (whether the grammar generates any terminal strings at all), is undecidable for context-sensitive grammars, but decidable for context-free grammars.

However, many problems are undecidable even for context-free grammars; the most prominent ones are handled in the following.

=== Universality ===
Given a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules?{{sfn|Sipser|1997|loc=Theorem 5.10|p=181}}{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=281}}

A reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a Turing machine accepts a particular input (the halting problem). The reduction uses the concept of a &quot;computation history&quot;, a string describing an entire computation of a Turing machine. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine does not accept that input.

=== Language equality ===
Given two CFGs, do they generate the same language?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=281}}

The undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: it is impossible to even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.

=== Language inclusion ===
Given two CFGs, can the first one generate all strings that the second one can generate?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=281}}

If this problem was decidable, then language equality could be decided too: two CFGs formula_73 and formula_74 generate the same language if formula_75 is a subset of formula_76 and formula_76 is a subset of formula_75.

=== Being in a lower or higher level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===
Using Greibach&#x27;s theorem, it can be shown that the two following problems are undecidable:

* Given a context-sensitive grammar, does it describe a context-free language?
* Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a regular language?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=281}}

=== Grammar ambiguity ===
Given a CFG, is it ambiguous?

The undecidability of this problem follows from the fact that if an algorithm to determine ambiguity existed, the Post correspondence problem could be decided, which is known to be undecidable.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|loc=Theorem 8.9|pp=200–201}} This may be proved by Ogden&#x27;s lemma.

=== Language disjointness ===
Given two CFGs, is there any string derivable from both grammars?

If this problem was decidable, the undecidable Post correspondence problem (PCP) could be decided, too: given strings formula_79 over some alphabet formula_80, let the grammar {{tmath|G_1}} consist of the rule
:formula_81;
where formula_82 denotes the reversed string formula_83 and formula_58 does not occur among the formula_85; and let grammar {{tmath|G_2}} consist of the rule
:formula_86;
Then the PCP instance given by formula_79 has a solution if and only if {{tmath|L(G_1)}} and {{tmath|L(G_2)}} share a derivable string. The left of the string (before the formula_88) will represent the top of the solution for the PCP instance while the right side will be the bottom in reverse.

== Extensions ==
An obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as agreement and reference, and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include affix grammars, attribute grammars, indexed grammars, and Van Wijngaarden two-level grammars. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.

An extended context-free grammar (or regular right part grammar) is one in which the right-hand side of the production rules is allowed to be a regular expression over the grammar&#x27;s terminals and nonterminals. Extended context-free grammars describe exactly the context-free languages.

Another extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left-hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of context-sensitive grammars.

== Subclasses ==
There are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:

* LR(&quot;k&quot;) grammars (also known as deterministic context-free grammars) allow parsing (string recognition) with deterministic pushdown automata (PDA), but they can only describe deterministic context-free languages.
* Simple LR, Look-Ahead LR grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing. SLR and LALR are recognized using the same PDA as LR, but with simpler tables, in most cases.
* LL(&quot;k&quot;) and LL(&quot;*&quot;) grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.
* Simple grammars are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.
* Bracketed grammars have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.
* Linear grammars have no rules with more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.
* Regular grammars are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the regular languages, i.e. they correspond to finite automata and regular expressions.

LR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, generalized LR parsing extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars. On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on nondeterministic grammars, it is as efficient as can be expected. Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and parser generators continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.

== Linguistic applications ==
Chomsky initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding transformation rules.

Such rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. passivization in English. Much of generative grammar has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations does not meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being Turing complete unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).

Chomsky&#x27;s general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then, although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved. Gerald Gazdar and Geoffrey Pullum have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as cross-serial dependencies in Swiss German and reduplication in Bambara), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.

<doc id="6760" wikidata="Q633581" url="?curid=6760" title="Cryonics">
<text>Cryonics (from &quot;kryos&quot;, meaning &quot;cold&quot;) is the low-temperature freezing (usually at ) and storage of human remains in the hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. Cryonics is regarded with skepticism by the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience, and its practice has been characterized as quackery. Suspended animation is a popular subject in science fiction.

Cryonics procedures can begin only after the &quot;patients&quot; are clinically and legally dead. Procedures may begin within minutes of death, and use cryoprotectants to try to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. It is not possible to reanimate a corpse that has undergone vitrification, as this damages the brain, including its neural circuits. The first corpse to be frozen was that of James Bedford, in 1967. As of 2014, about 250 bodies had been cryopreserved in the United States, and 1,500 people had made arrangements for cryopreservation of their remains.

Economic considerations make it difficult for cryonics corporations to remain in business long enough to take advantage of any long-term benefits. The &quot;patients&quot;, being dead, cannot continue to pay for their own preservation. Early attempts at cryonic preservation were made in the 1960s and early 1970s; most relied on family members to pay for the preservation and ended in failure, with all but one of the corpses cryopreserved before 1973 being thawed and disposed of.

==Conceptual basis==
Cryonicists argue that as long as brain structure remains intact, there is no fundamental barrier, given our current understanding of physics, to recovering its information content. Cryonics proponents go further than the mainstream consensus in saying that the brain does not have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonicists controversially say that a human can survive even within an inactive, badly damaged brain, as long as the original encoding of memory and personality can be adequately inferred and reconstituted from what remains.

Cryonics uses temperatures below −130 °C, called cryopreservation, in an attempt to preserve enough brain information to permit the revival of the cryopreserved person. Cryopreservation is accomplished by freezing with or without cryoprotectant to reduce ice damage, or by vitrification to avoid ice damage. Even using the best methods, cryopreservation of whole bodies or brains is very damaging and irreversible with current technology.

Cryonicists call the human remains packed into low-temperature vats &quot;patients&quot;. They hope that some kind of presently nonexistent nanotechnology will be able to bring the dead back to life and treat the diseases that killed them. Mind uploading has also been proposed.

==Cryonics in practice==
Cryonics can be expensive. , the cost of preparing and storing corpses using cryonics ranged from US$28,000 to $200,000.

At high concentrations, cryoprotectants can stop ice formation completely. Cooling and solidification without crystal formation is called vitrification. In the late 1990s, cryobiologists Gregory Fahy and Brian Wowk developed the first cryoprotectant solutions that could vitrify at very slow cooling rates while still allowing whole organ survival, for the purpose of banking transplantable organs. This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, thawed, and examined for ice damage using light and electron microscopy. No ice crystal damage was found; cellular damage was due to dehydration and toxicity of the cryoprotectant solutions.

Costs can include payment for medical personnel to be on call for death, vitrification, transportation in dry ice to a preservation facility, and payment into a trust fund intended to cover indefinite storage in liquid nitrogen and future revival costs. As of 2011, U.S. cryopreservation costs can range from $28,000 to $200,000, and are often financed via life insurance. KrioRus, which stores bodies communally in large dewars, charges $12,000 to $36,000 for the procedure. Some customers opt to have only their brain cryopreserved (&quot;neuropreservation&quot;), rather than their whole body.

As of 2014, about 250 corpses have been cryogenically preserved in the U.S., and around 1,500 people have signed up to have their remains preserved. As of 2016, there are four facilities that retain cryopreserved bodies, three in the U.S. and one in Russia.

A more recent development is Tomorrow Biostasis GmbH, a Berlin-based firm offering cryonics and standby and transportation services in Europe. Founded in 2019 by Emil Kendziorra and Fernando Azevedo Pinheiro, it partners with the European Biostasis Foundation in Switzerland for long-term corpse storage. The facility was completed in 2022.

It seems extremely unlikely that any cryonics company could exist long enough to take advantage of the supposed benefits offered; historically, even the most robust corporations have only a one-in-a-thousand chance of lasting 100 years. Many cryonics companies have failed; , all but one of the pre-1973 batch had gone out of business, and their stored corpses have been defrosted and disposed of.

==Obstacles to success==
=== Preservation damage ===
Medical laboratories have long used cryopreservation to maintain animal cells, human embryos, and even some organized tissues, for periods as long as three decades. But recovering large animals and organs from a frozen state is not considered possible now. Large vitrified organs tend to develop fractures during cooling, a problem worsened by the large tissue masses and very low temperatures of cryonics. Without cryoprotectants, cell shrinkage and high salt concentrations during freezing usually prevent frozen cells from functioning again after thawing. Ice crystals can also disrupt connections between cells that are necessary for organs to function.

Some cryonics organizations use vitrification without a chemical fixation step, sacrificing some structural preservation quality for less damage at the molecular level. Some scientists, like João Pedro Magalhães, have questioned whether using a deadly chemical for fixation eliminates the possibility of biological revival, making chemical fixation unsuitable for cryonics.

Outside of cryonics firms and cryonics-linked interest groups, many scientists are very skeptical about cryonics methods. Cryobiologist Dayong Gao has said, &quot;we simply don&#x27;t know if [subjects have] been damaged to the point where they&#x27;ve &#x27;died&#x27; during vitrification because the subjects are now inside liquid nitrogen canisters.&quot; Based on experience with organ transplants, biochemist Ken Storey argues that &quot;even if you only wanted to preserve the brain, it has dozens of different areas which would need to be cryopreserved using different protocols&quot;.

===Revival===
Revival would require repairing damage from lack of oxygen, cryoprotectant toxicity, thermal stress (fracturing), and freezing in tissues that do not successfully vitrify, followed by reversing the cause of death. In many cases, extensive tissue regeneration would be necessary. This revival technology remains speculative.

===Legal issues===
Historically, people had little control over how their bodies were treated after death, as religion held jurisdiction over the matter. But secular courts began to exercise jurisdiction over corpses and use discretion in carrying out deceased people&#x27;s wishes. Most countries legally treat preserved bodies as deceased persons because of laws that forbid vitrifying someone who is medically alive. In France, cryonics is not considered a legal mode of body disposal; only burial, cremation, and formal body donation to science are allowed, though bodies may legally be shipped to other countries for cryonic freezing. As of 2015, British Columbia prohibits the sale of arrangements for cryonic body preservation. In Russia, cryonics falls outside both the medical industry and the funeral services industry, making it easier than in the U.S. to get hospitals and morgues to release cryonics candidates.

In 2016, the English High Court ruled in favor of a mother&#x27;s right to seek cryopreservation of her terminally ill 14-year-old daughter, as the girl wanted, contrary to the father&#x27;s wishes. The decision was made on the basis that the case represented a conventional dispute over the disposal of the girl&#x27;s body, although the judge urged ministers to seek &quot;proper regulation&quot; for the future of cryonic preservation after the hospital raised concerns about the competence and professionalism of the team that conducted the preservation procedures. In &quot;Alcor Life Extension Foundation v. Richardson&quot;, the Iowa Court of Appeals ordered the disinterment of Richardson, who was buried against his wishes, for cryopreservation.

A detailed legal examination by Jochen Taupitz concludes that cryonic storage is legal in Germany for an indefinite period.

==Ethics==
Writing in &quot;Bioethics&quot; in 2009, David Shaw examined cryonics. The arguments he cited against it included changing the concept of death, the expense of preservation and revival, lack of scientific advancement to permit revival, temptation to use premature euthanasia, and failure due to catastrophe. Arguments in favor of cryonics include the potential benefit to society, the prospect of immortality, and the benefits associated with avoiding death. Shaw explores the expense and the potential payoff, and applies an adapted version of Pascal&#x27;s Wager to the question.

In 2016, Charles Tandy wrote in support of cryonics, arguing that honoring someone&#x27;s last wishes is seen as a benevolent duty in American and many other cultures.

==History==
Cryopreservation was applied to human cells beginning in 1954 with frozen sperm, which was thawed and used to inseminate three women. The freezing of humans was first scientifically proposed by Michigan professor Robert Ettinger in &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; (1962). In 1966, the first human body was frozen—though it had been embalmed for two months—by being placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at just above freezing. The middle-aged woman from Los Angeles, whose name is unknown, was soon thawed and buried by relatives.

The first body to be cryopreserved and then frozen in hope of future revival was that of James Bedford. Alcor&#x27;s Mike Darwin says Bedford&#x27;s body was cryopreserved around two hours after his death by cardiorespiratory arrest (secondary to metastasized kidney cancer) on January 12, 1967. Bedford&#x27;s corpse is the only one frozen before 1974 still preserved today. In 1976, Ettinger founded the Cryonics Institute; his corpse was cryopreserved in 2011. In 1981, Robert Nelson, &quot;a former TV repairman with no scientific background&quot; who led the Cryonics Society of California, was sued for allowing nine bodies to thaw and decompose in the 1970s; in his defense, he claimed that the Cryonics Society had run out of money. This lowered the reputation of cryonics in the U.S.

In 2018, a Y-Combinator startup called Nectome was recognized for developing a method of preserving brains with chemicals rather than by freezing. The method is fatal, performed as euthanasia under general anesthesia, but the hope is that future technology will allow the brain to be physically scanned into a computer simulation, neuron by neuron.

==Demographics==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, cryonicists are predominantly non-religious white men, outnumbering women by about three to one. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, as of 2008, while most cryonicists used to be young, male, and &quot;geeky&quot;, recent demographics have shifted slightly toward whole families.

In 2015, Du Hong, a 61-year-old female writer of children&#x27;s literature, became the first known Chinese national to have her head cryopreserved.

==Reception==
Cryonics is generally regarded as a fringe pseudoscience. Between 1982 and November 2018, the Society for Cryobiology rejected members who practiced cryonics, and issued a public statement saying that cryonics &quot;is an act of speculation or hope, not science&quot;, and as such outside the scope of the Society.

Russian company KrioRus is the first non-U.S. vendor of cryonics services. Yevgeny Alexandrov, chair of the Russian Academy of Sciences commission against pseudoscience, said there was &quot;no scientific basis&quot; for cryonics, and that the company was based on &quot;unfounded speculation&quot;.

Scientists have expressed skepticism about cryonics in media sources, and the Norwegian philosopher Ole Martin Moen has written that the topic receives a &quot;minuscule&quot; amount of attention in academia.

While some neuroscientists contend that all the subtleties of a human mind are contained in its anatomical structure, few will comment directly on cryonics due to its speculative nature. People who intend to be frozen are often &quot;looked at as a bunch of kooks&quot;. Cryobiologist Kenneth B. Storey said in 2004 that cryonics is impossible and will never be possible, as cryonics proponents are proposing to &quot;overturn the laws of physics, chemistry, and molecular science&quot;. Neurobiologist Michael Hendricks has said, &quot;Reanimation or simulation is an abjectly false hope that is beyond the promise of technology and is certainly impossible with the frozen, dead tissue offered by the &#x27;cryonics&#x27; industry&quot;.

Anthropologist Simon Dein writes that cryonics is a typical pseudoscience because of its lack of falsifiability and testability. In his view, cryonics is not science, but religion: it places faith in nonexistent technology and promises to overcome death.

William T. Jarvis has written, &quot;Cryonics might be a suitable subject for scientific research, but marketing an unproven method to the public is quackery&quot;.

According to cryonicist Aschwin de Wolf and others, cryonics can often produce intense hostility from spouses who are not cryonicists. James Hughes, the executive director of the pro-life-extension Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, has not personally signed up for cryonics, calling it a worthy experiment but saying, &quot;I value my relationship with my wife.&quot;

Cryobiologist Dayong Gao has said, &quot;People can always have hope that things will change in the future, but there is no scientific foundation supporting cryonics at this time.&quot; While it is universally agreed that personal identity is uninterrupted when brain activity temporarily ceases during incidents of accidental drowning (where people have been restored to normal functioning after being completely submerged in cold water for up to 66 minutes), one argument against cryonics is that a centuries-long absence from life might interrupt personal identity, such that the revived person would &quot;not be themself&quot;.

Maastricht University bioethicist David Shaw raises the argument that there would be no point in being revived in the far future if one&#x27;s friends and families are dead, leaving them all alone, but he notes that family and friends can also be frozen, that there is &quot;nothing to prevent the thawed-out freezee from making new friends&quot;, and that a lonely existence may be preferable to none at all.

==In fiction==

Suspended animation is a popular subject in science fiction and fantasy settings. It is often the means by which a character is transported into the future. The characters Philip J. Fry in &quot;Futurama&quot; and Khan Noonien Singh in &quot;Star Trek&quot; exemplify this trope.

A survey in Germany found that about half of the respondents were familiar with cryonics, and about half of those familiar with it had learned of it from films or television.

==In popular culture==
The town of Nederland, Colorado, hosts an annual Frozen Dead Guy Days festival to commemorate a substandard attempt at cryopreservation.

== Notable people ==

Corpses subjected to the cryonics process include those of baseball players Ted Williams and his son John Henry Williams (in 2002 and 2004, respectively), engineer and doctor L. Stephen Coles (in 2014), economist and entrepreneur Phil Salin, and software engineer Hal Finney (in 2014).

People known to have arranged for cryonics upon death include PayPal founders Luke Nosek and Peter Thiel, Oxford transhumanists Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg, and transhumanist philosopher David Pearce. Larry King once arranged for cryonics but, according to &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, changed his mind.

Sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein wanted to have his head and penis frozen after death.

The corpses of some are mistakenly believed to have undergone cryonics. The urban legend that Walt Disney&#x27;s remains were cryopreserved is false; it was cremated and interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. Timothy Leary was a long-time cryonics advocate and signed up with a major cryonics provider, but changed his mind shortly before his death and was not cryopreserved.
