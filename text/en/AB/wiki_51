<text>The Kennedy family () is an American political family that has long been prominent in American politics, public service, entertainment, and business. In 1884, 35 years after the family&#x27;s arrival from County Wexford, Ireland, Patrick Joseph &quot;P. J.&quot; Kennedy became the first Kennedy elected to public office, serving in the Massachusetts state legislature until 1895. At least one Kennedy family member was serving in federal elective office in every year from 1947, when P. J. Kennedy&#x27;s grandson John F. Kennedy became a member of Congress from Massachusetts, until 2011, when Patrick J. Kennedy II (John&#x27;s nephew) retired as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Rhode Island.

P. J.&#x27;s son Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and his wife, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, had nine children, including John F. Kennedy, who served in both houses of the United States Congress and as U.S. President; Robert F. Kennedy, who served as U.S. Attorney General and as a U.S. Senator; and Ted Kennedy, who served more than 46 years in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. currently serves as the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in the cabinet of the second Trump Administration. 

Other Kennedy descendants include members of the U.S. House of Representatives, two U.S. ambassadors, one U.S. envoy, a lieutenant governor, three state legislators (one of whom also served in the U.S. House of Representatives), and one mayor.

Joseph and Rose&#x27;s daughter Eunice played a vital role in establishing the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (part of the National Institutes of Health) and the Special Olympics. Other descendants of Joseph and Rose Kennedy have been lawyers, authors, and activists on behalf of those with physical and intellectual disabilities.

==History==
According to genealogist Brian Kennedy in his work &quot;JFK&#x27;s Irish O&#x27;Kennedy Ancestors&quot;, the Kennedys—who would go on to play a significant role in the United States of America—originated from an Irish clan called Ó Cinnéide Fionn (which, along with the Ó Cinnéide Donn and Ó Cinnéide Ruadh, were the three Irish Gaelic Ó Cinnéide clans who ruled the Kingdom of Ormond). In 1546, their progenitor Diarmaid Ó Cinnéide Fionn became the owner of Knigh Castle, located close to what is today Puckane, County Tipperary. In 1740, having lost out to the New English order in the Kingdom of Ireland, they moved to Dunganstown, New Ross, County Wexford. Patrick Kennedy was born there.

Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) and Bridget Murphy (1824–1888) sailed from Ireland to East Boston in 1849. Patrick worked in East Boston as a barrel maker, or cooper, and had five children with Bridget. Their youngest, Patrick Joseph &quot;P. J.&quot; Kennedy, went into business and served in the Massachusetts state legislature from 1884 to 1895.

P. J. and his wife, Mary Augusta Hickey, had four children. Their oldest was Joseph Patrick &quot;Joe&quot; Kennedy Sr., a businessman who amassed a private fortune in banking and securities trading, which he further expanded by investing in filmmaking and real estate. He also founded Somerset Importers and owned Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart.

In 1914, Joseph Sr. married Rose Fitzgerald, the eldest daughter of John F. &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, who served six years as mayor of Boston and six years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The couple had nine children: Joseph Jr. (1915–1944), John (called Jack) (1917–1963), Rose Marie (called Rosemary) (1918–2005), Kathleen (called Kick) (1920–1948), Eunice (1921–2009), Patricia (1924–2006), Robert (called Bobby) (1925–1968), Jean (1928–2020) and Edward (called Ted) (1932–2009).

Joseph Sr. was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), chairman of the Maritime Commission, and U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1940. He served from 1947 to 1949 on The Hoover Commission (the &quot;Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government&quot;), which was appointed by President Harry Truman to recommend administrative changes in the federal government. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy was named Papal Countess of the Holy Roman Church by Pope Pius XII in 1951 in recognition of her &quot;exemplary motherhood and many charitable works.&quot;

==Continued public service==

Every Kennedy elected to public office has served as a Democrat, while other members of the family have worked for the party or held Cabinet posts in Democratic administrations. Many have attended Harvard University, and the family has contributed greatly to that university&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

Joseph Sr. expected his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to go into politics and to ultimately be elected president. Joseph Jr. was elected as a Massachusetts delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention and enlisted in the U.S. Navy after the United States entered World War II. He was killed in 1944 when the bomber he was piloting exploded in flight. Joseph Sr.&#x27;s desire to see the family involved in politics and government then focused on John, who had considered a career as a journalist, having authored a book (&quot;Why England Slept&quot;) and done some reporting for Hearst Newspapers. After returning from Navy service, John served in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Massachusetts&#x27;s 11th congressional district from 1947 to 1953, and then as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. In the 1960 presidential election, John narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon.

During John&#x27;s administration, Robert served as attorney general, their brother-in-law Sargent Shriver served as director of the new Peace Corps, and Ted became the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts until his death in 2009. The Kennedy administration&#x27;s accomplishments include the Alliance for Progress with Latin America, the establishment of the Peace Corps, a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution ending the poll tax, the continuation of the Apollo spaceflight program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon, and the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to Congress (signed into law by Kennedy&#x27;s successor Lyndon B. Johnson). The family was the subject of intense media coverage during and after Kennedy&#x27;s presidency.

Ted served in the Senate with his brother Robert (1965–1968), and was serving in the Senate when his nephew, Joseph P. II, and his son, Patrick J., served in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district (1987–1999) and Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district (1995–2011), respectively. In November 2012, Joseph P. Kennedy III, son of former U.S. representative Joseph P. Kennedy II and grandson of former senior Robert F. Kennedy, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts&#x27;s 4th congressional district. In 2020, Joseph P. III lost the U.S. Senate primary election in Massachusetts to incumbent Ed Markey, the first Kennedy to ever lose an election in the state.

In the 2020s, three Kennedy family members were serving as U.S. ambassadors or envoys. Victoria Reggie Kennedy, second wife of Ted Kennedy, was named in 2021 by President Joe Biden as U.S. ambassador to Austria. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President Kennedy, was named in 2022 by President Biden as U.S. ambassador to Australia; she previously served as U.S. ambassador to Japan under President Barack Obama. In the same year, Joseph P. Kennedy III was named by President Biden as U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland. 

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ran for president in the 2024 United States presidential election, originally as a Democrat, but changing his affiliation to Independent in October 2023. Family members spoke out against him, mainly due to his anti-vaccine views, and instead endorsed President Joe Biden. In August 2024, two months before the election, Robert Jr. withdrew and endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump, who won the election. Trump nominated him to be United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 52-48.

In addition, some Kennedy spouses have served in government:

There was a member of the Kennedy family in public office nearly continuously from 1946, when John F. Kennedy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, until early 2011, when Patrick J. Kennedy left the House. The only exception was the period between John F. Kennedy&#x27;s resignation from the Senate on December 22, 1960, and his assumption of the office of President on January 20, 1961. In 2013, two years after Patrick Kennedy left the House, Joseph P. Kennedy III was elected U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and served until 2021. Below is a timeline of the Kennedys&#x27; tenure in the U.S. Congress.

===Timeline===


==Heraldry==
On March 17, 1961, John F. Kennedy was presented with a grant of arms for all the descendants of Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) from the Chief Herald of Ireland. The design of the arms (three gold closed helmets on a black field) strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of the O&#x27;Kennedys of Ormonde and the FitzGeralds of Desmond, from whom the family is descended. The crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches, elements taken from the coat of arms of the United States of America and also symbolic of Kennedy and his brothers.

<doc id="7959" wikidata="Q7174" url="?curid=7959" title="Democracy">
<text>Democracy (from , &quot;dēmos&quot; &#x27;people&#x27; and &quot;kratos&quot; &#x27;rule&#x27;) is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state. Under a minimalist definition of democracy, rulers are elected through competitive elections while more expansive or maximalist definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights in addition to competitive elections.

In a direct democracy, the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation. In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of &quot;the people&quot; and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy oftentimes include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.

The notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority—usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.

The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean &quot;rule of the people&quot;, in contrast to aristocracy (, &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;rule of an elite&quot;. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government, democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization. Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world, as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives, and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world&#x27;s population lives in a democracy .

==Characteristics==

Although democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting, no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy. Karl Popper says that the &quot;classical&quot; view of democracy is, &quot;in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule&quot;. One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.

Democratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution, while other uses of &quot;democracy&quot; may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy &quot;provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.&quot;

One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality. Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.

In some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence. In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review. Though the term &quot;democracy&quot; is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.

Democracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally ,&quot; i.e. and . In some countries, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed, enabling them to vote according to their own interests and beliefs.

It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.

Republics, though often popularly associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed, are not necessarily democracies, as republicanism does not specify &quot;how&quot; the people are to rule.
Classically the term &quot;republic&quot; encompassed both democracies and aristocracies. In a modern sense the republican form of government is a form of government without a monarch. Because of this, democracies can be republics or constitutional monarchies, such as the United Kingdom.

==History==


Democratic assemblies are as old as the human species and are found throughout human history, but up until the nineteenth century, major political figures have largely opposed democracy. Republican theorists linked democracy to small size: as political units grew in size, the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic. At the same time, small political units were vulnerable to conquest. Montesquieu wrote, &quot;If a republic be small, it is destroyed by a foreign force; if it is large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection.&quot; According to Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Deudney, the creation of the United States, with its large size and its system of checks and balances, was a solution to the dual problems of size. Forms of democracy occurred organically in societies around the world that had no contact with each other.

===Origins===

====Greece and Rome====
The term &quot;democracy&quot; first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of Athens during classical antiquity. The word comes from &quot;dêmos&quot; &#x27;(common) people&#x27; and &quot;krátos&quot; &#x27;force/might&#x27;. Under Cleisthenes, what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in the sixth-century BC (508–507 BC) was established in Athens. Cleisthenes is referred to as &quot;the father of Athenian democracy&quot;. The first attested use of the word democracy is found in prose works of the 430s BC, such as Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, but its usage was older by several decades, as two Athenians born in the 470s were named Democrates, a new political name—likely in support of democracy—given at a time of debates over constitutional issues in Athens. Aeschylus also strongly alludes to the word in his play &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, staged in c.463 BC, where he mentions &quot;the demos&#x27;s ruling hand&quot; [&quot;demou kratousa cheir&quot;]. Before that time, the word used to define the new political system of Cleisthenes was probably isonomia, meaning political equality.

Athenian democracy took the form of direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the random selection of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices, and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens. All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (μέτοικοι / &quot;métoikoi&quot;), and youths below the age of military service. Effectively, only 1 in 4 residents in Athens qualified as citizens. Owning land was not a requirement for citizenship. The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.

Athenian democracy was not only &quot;direct&quot; in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the &quot;most direct&quot; in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for &quot;rights&quot;), those who were citizens of Athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.

Range voting appeared in Sparta as early as 700 BC. The Spartan ecclesia was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of at least 20 years of age could participate. In the assembly, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting (the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts). Aristotle called this &quot;childish&quot;, as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenian citizenry. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any biased voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.

Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of weighted voting, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom was the first case in the Western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a republic, although it did not have much of a democracy. The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries.

====Ancient India ====
Vaishali, capital city of the Vajjika League (Vrijji mahajanapada) of India, is considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BC.

====Americas====
Other cultures, such as the Iroquois in the Americas also developed a form of democratic society between 1450 and 1660 (and possibly in 1142), well before contact with the Europeans. This democracy continues to the present day and is the world&#x27;s oldest standing representative democracy.

====Africa====
===Middle Ages===
While most regions in Europe during the Middle Ages were ruled by clergy or feudal lords, there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies, although often only involving a small part of the population. In Scandinavia, bodies known as things consisted of freemen presided by a lawspeaker. These deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions, and variants included the Althing in Iceland and the Løgting in the Faeroe Islands. The veche, found in Eastern Europe, was a similar body to the Scandinavian thing. In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope has been elected by a papal conclave composed of cardinals since 1059. The first documented parliamentary body in Europe was the Cortes of León. Established by Alfonso IX in 1188, the Cortes had authority over setting taxation, foreign affairs and legislating, though the exact nature of its role remains disputed. The Republic of Ragusa, established in 1358 and centered around the city of Dubrovnik, provided representation and voting rights to its male aristocracy only. Various Italian city-states and polities had republic forms of government. For instance, the Republic of Florence, established in 1115, was led by the Signoria whose members were chosen by sortition. In the 10th–15th century Frisia, a distinctly non-feudal society, the right to vote on local matters and on county officials was based on land size. The Kouroukan Fouga divided the Mali Empire into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the &quot;Gbara&quot;. However, the charter made Mali more similar to a constitutional monarchy than a democratic republic.

The Parliament of England had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into Magna Carta (1215), which explicitly protected certain rights of the King&#x27;s subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus, safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with the right to appeal. The first representative national assembly in England was Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament in 1265. The emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people. However, the power to call parliament remained at the pleasure of the monarch.

Studies have linked the emergence of parliamentary institutions in Europe during the medieval period to urban agglomeration and the creation of new classes, such as artisans, as well as the presence of nobility and religious elites. Scholars have also linked the emergence of representative government to Europe&#x27;s relative political fragmentation. Political scientist David Stasavage links the fragmentation of Europe, and its subsequent democratization, to the manner in which the Roman Empire collapsed: Roman territory was conquered by small fragmented groups of Germanic tribes, thus leading to the creation of small political units where rulers were relatively weak and needed the consent of the governed to ward off foreign threats.

In Poland, noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle nobility, which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates. Magnates dominated the most important offices in the state (secular and ecclesiastical) and sat on the royal council, later the senate. The growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land &quot;sejmik&quot; (local assembly), which subsequently obtained more rights. During the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century, sejmiks received more and more power and became the most important institutions of local power. In 1454, Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the Nieszawa Statutes. He also pledged not to create new laws without their consent.

===Modern era===

====Early modern period====

In 17th century England, there was renewed interest in Magna Carta. The Parliament of England passed the Petition of Right in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The English Civil War (1642–1651) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament, during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647. Subsequently, the Protectorate (1653–59) and the English Restoration (1660) restored more autocratic rule, although Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Bill of Rights was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, royal absolutism would not prevail. Economic historians Douglass North and Barry Weingast have characterized the institutions implemented in the Glorious Revolution as a resounding success in terms of restraining the government and ensuring protection for property rights.

Renewed interest in the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the British Isles. Thomas Hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory. Writing in the &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651), Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot; and constantly waged a war of all against all. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature, Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong, authoritarian power. In other words, Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which, in his opinion, was the best form of government. Later, philosopher and physician John Locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1689), Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life, liberty and estate (property). According to Locke, individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights. Particularly important for Locke were property rights, whose protection Locke deemed to be a government&#x27;s primary purpose. Furthermore, Locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed. For Locke, citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical. Although they were not widely read during his lifetime, Locke&#x27;s works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution. His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world.

In the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Cossack Hetmanate and Zaporizhian Sich, the holder of the highest post of Hetman was elected by the representatives from the country&#x27;s districts.

In North America, representative government began in Jamestown, Virginia, with the election of the House of Burgesses (forerunner of the Virginia General Assembly) in 1619. English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic; although these local assemblies had some small amounts of devolved power, the ultimate authority was held by the Crown and the English Parliament. The Puritans (Pilgrim Fathers), Baptists, and Quakers who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters.

====18th and 19th centuries====

The first Parliament of Great Britain was established in 1707, after the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union. Two key documents of the UK&#x27;s uncodified constitution, the English Declaration of Right, 1689 (restated in the Bill of Rights 1689) and the Scottish Claim of Right 1689, had both cemented Parliament&#x27;s position as the supreme law-making body and said that the &quot;election of members of Parliament ought to be free&quot;. However, Parliament was only elected by male property owners, which amounted to 3% of the population in 1780. The first known British person of African heritage to vote in a general election, Ignatius Sancho, voted in 1774 and 1780.

During the Age of Liberty in Sweden (1718–1772), civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament. The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament, although with little influence, but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage.

The creation of the short-lived Corsican Republic in 1755 was an early attempt to adopt a democratic constitution (all men and women above age of 25 could vote). This Corsican Constitution was the first based on Enlightenment principles and included female suffrage, something that was not included in most other democracies until the 20th century.
Colonial America had similar property qualifications as Britain, and in the period before 1776 the abundance and availability of land meant that large numbers of colonists met such requirements with at least 60 per cent of adult white males able to vote. The great majority of white men were farmers who met the property ownership or taxpaying requirements. With few exceptions, no blacks or women could vote. Vermont, which, on declaring independence of Great Britain in 1777, adopted a constitution modelled on Pennsylvania&#x27;s citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property. The United States Constitution of 1787 is the oldest surviving, still active, governmental codified constitution. The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties, but did not end slavery nor extend voting rights in the United States, instead leaving the issue of suffrage to the individual states. Generally, states limited suffrage to white male property owners and taxpayers. At the time of the first Presidential election in 1789, about 6% of the population was eligible to vote. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. The Bill of Rights in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.
In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all men in 1792. The Polish-Lithuanian Constitution of 3 May 1791 sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy, introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. In force for less than 19 months, it was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793. Nonetheless, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country&#x27;s sovereignty over a century later.

In the United States, the 1828 presidential election was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of the adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election. North Carolina was the last state to abolish property qualification in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage (however tax-paying requirements remained in five states in 1860 and survived in two states until the 20th century). In the 1860 United States census, the slave population had grown to four million, and in Reconstruction after the Civil War, three constitutional amendments were passed: the 13th Amendment (1865) that ended slavery; the 14th Amendment (1869) that gave black people citizenship, and the 15th Amendment (1870) that gave black males a nominal right to vote. Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the civil rights movement gained passage by the US Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The voting franchise in the United Kingdom was expanded and made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the Reform Act 1832 and continued into the 20th century, notably with the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Equal Franchise Act 1928. Universal male suffrage was established in France in March 1848 in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. During that year, several revolutions broke out in Europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.

In 1876, the Ottoman Empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament. Provisional Electoral Regulations were issued, stating that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect members to the first Parliament. Later that year, a new constitution was promulgated, which provided for a bicameral Parliament with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a popularly elected Chamber of Deputies. Only men above the age of 30 who were competent in Turkish and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election. Reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship, being employed by a foreign government, being bankrupt, employed as a servant, or having &quot;notoriety for ill deeds&quot;. Full universal suffrage was achieved in 1934.

In 1893, the self-governing colony New Zealand became the first country in the world (except for the short-lived 18th-century Corsican Republic) to establish active universal suffrage by recognizing women as having the right to vote.

====20th and 21st centuries====
20th-century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive &quot;waves of democracy&quot;, variously resulting from wars, revolutions, decolonisation, and religious and economic circumstances. Global waves of &quot;democratic regression&quot; reversing democratization, have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s, in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the 2010s.

World War I and the dissolution of the autocratic Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states in Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic. In the 1920s democratic movements flourished and women&#x27;s suffrage advanced, but the Great Depression brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. Fascism and dictatorships flourished in Nazi Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, as well as non-democratic governments in the Baltics, the Balkans, Brazil, Cuba, China, and Japan, among others.

World War II brought a definitive reversal of this trend in Western Europe. The democratisation of the American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany (disputed), Austria, Italy, and the occupied Japan served as a model for the later theory of government change. However, most of Eastern Europe, including the Soviet sector of Germany fell into the non-democratic Soviet-dominated bloc.

The war was followed by decolonisation, and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. India emerged as the world&#x27;s largest democracy and continues to be so. Countries that were once part of the British Empire often adopted the British Westminster system.

In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights mandated democracy:

By 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although most of the world&#x27;s populations lived in nominal democracies that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in &quot;Communist&quot; states and the former colonies). A subsequent wave of democratisation brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states, dubbed &quot;third wave of democracy&quot;. Portugal, Spain, and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the 1970s and 1980s. This was followed by countries in East and South Asia by the mid-to-late 1980s. Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the associated end of the Cold War, and the democratisation and liberalisation of the former Eastern bloc countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now either part of the European Union or candidate states. In 1986, after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship, the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the Philippines with the rise of Corazon Aquino, who would later be known as the mother of Asian democracy.

The liberal trend spread to some states in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the Indonesian Revolution of 1998, the Bulldozer Revolution in Yugoslavia, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia.

According to Freedom House, in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies (up from 40 in 1972). According to &quot;World Forum on Democracy&quot;, electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 per cent of the world&#x27;s population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 per cent of the global population. Also in 2007 the United Nations declared 15 September the International Day of Democracy.

Many countries reduced their voting age to 18 years; the major democracies began to do so in the 1970s starting in Western Europe and North America. Most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than 18 from voting. The voting age has been lowered to 16 for national elections in a number of countries, including Brazil, Austria, Cuba, and Nicaragua. In California, a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated. In 2008, the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth, to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves.

According to Freedom House, starting in 2005, there have been 17 consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements, as populist and nationalist political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland (under the Law and Justice party) to the Philippines (under Rodrigo Duterte). In a Freedom House report released in 2018, Democracy Scores for most countries declined for the 12th consecutive year. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that nationalist and populist political ideologies were gaining ground, at the expense of rule of law, in countries like Poland, Turkey and Hungary. For example, in Poland, the President appointed 27 new Supreme Court judges over legal objections from the European Commission. In Turkey, thousands of judges were removed from their positions following a failed coup attempt during a government crackdown .

&quot;Democratic backsliding&quot; in the 2010s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent, personalism, poor government&#x27;s management of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors such as manipulation of civil society, &quot;toxic polarization&quot;, foreign disinformation campaigns, racism and nativism, excessive executive power, and decreased power of the opposition. Within English-speaking Western democracies, &quot;protection-based&quot; attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance.

==Theory==

===Early theory===
Aristotle contrasted rule by the many (democracy/timocracy), with rule by the few (oligarchy/aristocracy/elitism), and with rule by a single person (tyranny/autocracy/absolute monarchy). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).

A common view among early and renaissance Republican theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities. Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republic&#x27;s shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny. Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units. Montesquieu famously said, &quot;if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice.&quot; Rousseau asserted, &quot;It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince.&quot;

===Contemporary theory===
Among modern political theorists, there are different fundamental conceptions of democracy.

====Aggregation====
The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens&#x27; preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented. Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. 

According to the minimalist democracy conception, elections are a mechanism for competition between politicians. Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view famously in his book &quot;Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy&quot;. Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H. Riker, Adam Przeworski, Richard Posner. 
According to the median voter theorem governments will tend to produce laws and policies close to the views of the median voter with half to their left and the other half to their right. Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individuals and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot;.

According to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Proponents view citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

====Polyarchy====
Robert A. Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation. Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that &quot;democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.&quot;

====Deliberation====
Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule. Citizens assemblies are considered by many scholars as practical examples of deliberative democracy, with a recent OECD report identifying citizens assemblies as an increasingly popular mechanism to involve citizens in governmental decision-making.

==Measurement of democracy==


Measurement of democracy varies according to the different fundamental conceptions of democracy. Minimalist democracy evaluations focus on free and fair elections, while maximalist democracy evaluates additional values, such as human rights, deliberation, economic outcomes or state capacity.

==Types of governmental democracies==
Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.

The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.

===Basic forms===
Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly. In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a representative democracy.

====Direct====


Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:
* Change constitutional laws,
* Put forth initiatives, referendums and suggestions for laws

Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens&#x27; initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy. However, some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face-to-face discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus, the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities, communities affiliated with the CIPO-RFM, the Bolivian city councils of FEJUVE, and Kurdish cantons of Rojava.

=====Semi-direct=====
Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed &quot;semi-direct democracies&quot; or &quot;participatory democracies&quot;. Examples include Switzerland and some U.S. states, where frequent use is made of referendums and initiatives.

The Swiss confederation is a semi-direct democracy. At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution (federal popular initiative) or ask for a referendum to be held on any law voted by the parliament. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums). Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum.

Examples include the extensive use of referendums in the US state of California, which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.

In New England, town meetings are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local direct democracy and a representative state government. For example, most Vermont towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.

=====Lot system=====
The use of a lot system, a characteristic of Athenian democracy, is a feature of some versions of direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery.

====Representative====
Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also democratically elected then it is called a democratic republic. The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a plurality of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.

Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or constituency), or represent the entire electorate through proportional systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as referendums. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people&#x27;s interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy, pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy

=====Parliamentary=====
Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a &quot;presidential rule&quot; wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.

In a parliamentary system, the prime minister may be dismissed by the legislature at any point in time for not meeting the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a vote of no confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the prime minister from office with majority support for dismissal. In some countries, the prime minister can also call an election at any point in time, typically when the prime minister believes that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the &quot;loyal opposition&quot;. The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or opposition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.

=====Presidential=====
Presidential democracy is a system where the public elects the president through an election. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. The legislature often has limited ability to remove a president from office. Elections typically have a fixed date and are not easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.

The executive usually has the responsibility to execute or implement legislation and may have the limited legislative powers, such as a veto. However, a legislative branch passes legislation and budgets. This provides some measure of separation of powers. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.

A semi-presidential system is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.

===Typology===

====Constitutional monarchy====

Many countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Thailand, Japan and Bhutan turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs (often gradually) with limited or symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Strongly limited constitutional monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, have been referred to as crowned republics by writers such as H. G. Wells.

In other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece, and Egypt). An elected person, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.

Elite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many states. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British House of Lords) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the Australian Senate).

====Republic====
The term &quot;republic&quot; has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state, such as a president, serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed head of government such as a prime minister.

The Founding Fathers of the United States often criticised direct democracy, which in their view often came without the protection of a constitution enshrining inalienable rights; James Madison argued, especially in &quot;The Federalist&quot; No. 10, that what distinguished a direct &quot;democracy&quot; from a &quot;republic&quot; was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.

Professors Richard Ellis of Willamette University and Michael Nelson of Rhodes College argue that much constitutional thought, from Madison to Lincoln and beyond, has focused on &quot;the problem of majority tyranny&quot;. They conclude, &quot;The principles of republican government embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to ensure that the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness would not be trampled by majorities.&quot; What was critical to American values, John Adams insisted, was that the government be &quot;bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.&quot; As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the US Constitution, Elizabeth Willing Powel asked him &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?&quot;. He replied &quot;A republic—if you can keep it.&quot;

====Liberal====
A liberal democracy is a representative democracy which enshrines a liberal political philosophy, where the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the rule of law, moderated by a constitution or laws that such as the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and constrained on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities.

====Socialist====
Socialist thought has several different views on democracy. Social democracy, democratic socialism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory, industrial, economic and/or workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy.

Trotskyist groups have interpreted socialist democracy to be synonymous with multi-party socialist representation, autonomous union organizations, worker&#x27;s control of production, internal party democracy and the mass participation of the working masses.

====Marxist====
Within Marxist orthodoxy there is a hostility to what is commonly called &quot;liberal democracy&quot;, which is referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists&#x27; desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, Marxists, Leninists, and Trotskyists believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of communes (which are sometimes called soviets). This system can begin with workplace democracy and ultimately manifests itself as council democracy.

====Anarchist====
Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a majority-rule is tyrannic or not. To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous. However, anarcho-communist Murray Bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy, and says &quot;majority rule&quot; is consistent with anarchism.

Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of consensus democracy, similar to Proudhon&#x27;s position on direct democracy.

====Sortition====
Sortition is the process of choosing decision-making bodies via a random selection. These bodies can be more representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large than an elected legislature or other decision-maker. The technique was in widespread use in Athenian Democracy and Renaissance Florence and is still used in modern jury selection and citizens&#x27; assemblies.

====Consociational====
Consociational democracy, also called consociationalism, is a form of democracy based on power-sharing formula between elites representing the social groups within the society. In 1969, Arendt Lijphart argued this would stabilize democracies with factions. A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them. The Qualified majority voting rule in European Council of Ministers is a consociational democracy approach for supranational democracies. This system in Treaty of Rome allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. A consociational democracy requires consensus of representatives, while consensus democracy requires consensus of electorate.

====Majoritarian====
====Consensus====
Consensus democracy requires consensus decision-making and supermajority to obtain a larger support than majority. In contrast, in majoritarian democracy minority opinions can potentially be ignored by vote-winning majorities. Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajorities.

====Ethnic====
====Inclusive====
Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, economic democracy in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. self-management in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos in &quot;Towards An Inclusive Democracy&quot; and was further developed in the journal &quot;Democracy &amp; Nature&quot; and its successor &quot;The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy&quot;.

====Participatory====
A parpolity or participatory polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a nested council structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision-making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.

A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority, and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy.

====Procedural====
====Radical====
Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Radical democracy&#x27;s role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.

====Religious====
====Cosmopolitan====
Cosmopolitan democracy, also known as &quot;global democracy&quot; or &quot;world federalism&quot;, is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.

According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing international organisations, e.g., the United Nations, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament, which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.

Cosmopolitan democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein, writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist George Monbiot, and professors David Held and Daniele Archibugi. The creation of the International Criminal Court in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.

====Creative====
Creative democracy is advocated by American philosopher John Dewey. The main idea about creative democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of &quot;Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us&quot; and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey&#x27;s view, is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. &quot;The task of democracy&quot;, Dewey concludes, &quot;is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute&quot;.

====Guided====

Guided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully &quot;guides&quot; the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them. Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority. Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a &quot;guided democracy&quot;. Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power/ authority, as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government.

==Non-governmental democracy==
Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many non-governmental organisations decide policy and leadership by voting. Most trade unions and cooperatives are governed by democratic elections. Corporations are ultimately governed by their shareholders through shareholder democracy. Corporations may also employ systems such as workplace democracy to handle internal governance. Amitai Etzioni has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with sharia law, termed Islamic democracy or &quot;&quot;. There is also a growing number of Democratic educational institutions such as Sudbury schools that are co-governed by students and staff.

===Shareholder democracy===
Shareholder democracy is a concept relating to the governance of corporations by their shareholders. In the United States, shareholders are typically granted voting rights according to the one share, one vote principle. Shareholders may vote annually to elect the company&#x27;s board of directors, who themselves may choose the company&#x27;s executives. The shareholder democracy framework may be inaccurate for companies which have different classes of stock that further alter the distribution of voting rights.

==Justification==
Several justifications for democracy have been postulated.

===Legitimacy===
Social contract theory argues that the legitimacy of government is based on consent of the governed, i.e. an election, and that political decisions must reflect the general will. Some proponents of the theory like Jean-Jacques Rousseau advocate for a direct democracy on this basis.

===Better decision-making===
Condorcet&#x27;s jury theorem is logical proof that if each decision-maker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision, then having the largest number of decision-makers, i.e. a democracy, will result in the best decisions. This has also been argued by theories of the wisdom of the crowd. Democracy tends to improve conflict resolution.

===Economic success===
In &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot;, economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor monopolies at the expense of the creative destruction which is necessary for sustained economic growth.

A 2019 study by Acemoglu and others estimated that countries switching to democratic from authoritarian rule had on average a 20% higher GDP after 25 years than if they had remained authoritarian. The study examined 122 transitions to democracy and 71 transitions to authoritarian rule, occurring from 1960 to 2010. Acemoglu said this was because democracies tended to invest more in health care and human capital, and reduce special treatment of regime allies.

A 2023 study analyzed the long-term effects of democracy on economic prosperity using new data on GDP per capita and democracy for a dataset between 1789 and 2019. The results indicate that democracy substantially increases economic development.

==Democratic transitions==

A democratic transition describes a phase in a country&#x27;s political system, often created as a result of an incomplete change from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one (or vice versa).

===Democratization===

Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy. Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development. In a related theory, Ronald Inglehart suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on self-expression values, which correlates closely with democracy.

Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that democracy causes peace, but this study shows that, historically, peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy.

Carroll Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy: Democracy—this scenario—tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use. By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments could not do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns. Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy.

Other theories stressed the relevance of education and of human capital—and within them of cognitive ability to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished:
* a cognitive effect (competence to make rational choices, better information-processing)
* an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence.

Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. In fact, empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests: historically, most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy. Rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization, in some situations education provision may instead be used by non-democratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power.

The assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence. Across different countries, the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak (.07). A similarly weak relationship exists between per-pupil expenditures and math competency (.26). Additionally, historical evidence suggests that average human capital (measured using literacy rates) of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in France from 1750 to 1850 despite arguments to the contrary. Together, these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case. Instead, the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals, or, alternatively, that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development.

Some scholars have searched for the &quot;deep&quot; determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.

An example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the tsetse fly—which afflicts humans and livestock—reduced the ability of Africans to plough the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated. This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa. Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies.

An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade. Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broadened power. Rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect property-rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power.

Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy:

The peasant in the fable, when on his deathbed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man&#x27;s death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy.

Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government from a non-democratic state is typically brought by peaceful or violent democratic revolution.

===Autocratization===


Steven Levitsky says: “It&#x27;s not up to voters to defend a democracy. That’s asking far, far too much of voters, to cast their ballot on the basis of some set of abstract principles or procedures. With the exception of a handful of cases, voters never, ever — in any society, in any culture — prioritize democracy over all else. Individual voters worry about much more mundane things, as is their right. It is up to élites and institutions to protect democracy — not voters.” 

====Disruption====
Some democratic governments have experienced sudden state collapse and regime change to an undemocratic form of government. Domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown. (See List of coups and coup attempts by country and List of civil wars.) Examples include the Spanish Civil War, the Coup of 18 Brumaire that ended the French First Republic, and the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état which ended the First Portuguese Republic. Some military coups are supported by foreign governments, such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état and the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état. Other types of a sudden end to democracy include:
* Invasion, for example the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, and the fall of South Vietnam.
* Self-coup, in which the leader of the government extra-legally seizes all power or unlawfully extends the term in office. This can be done through:
** Suspension of the constitution by decree, such as with the 1992 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état
** An &quot;electoral self-coup&quot; using election fraud to obtain re-election of a previously fairly elected official or political party. For example, in the 1999 Ukrainian presidential election, 2003 Russian legislative election, and 2004 Russian presidential election.
* Royal coup, in which a monarch not normally involved in government seizes all power. For example, the 6 January Dictatorship, begun in 1929 when King Alexander I of Yugoslavia dismissed parliament and started ruling by decree.

Democratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner, by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections, freedom of expression, independence of the judiciary, rule of law. A famous example is the Enabling Act of 1933, which lawfully ended democracy in Weimar Germany and marked the transition to Nazi Germany.

Temporary or long-term political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections, which erode the democratic nature of governments. This has happened on a local level even in well-established democracies like the United States; for example, the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and African-American disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era.

===Debates on democracy===
===Influence of the media===
The theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues, policies, and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision. Since the late 20th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed due to the news media&#x27;s focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues.

The media professors Michael Gurevitch and Jay Blumler have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy:
* Surveillance of the sociopolitical environment
* Meaningful agenda setting
* Platforms for an intelligible and illuminating advocacy
* Dialogue across a diverse range of views
* Mechanisms for holding officials to account for how they have exercised power
* Incentives for citizens to learn, choose, and become involved
* A principled resistance to the efforts of forces outside the media to subvert their independence, integrity, and ability to serve the audience
* A sense of respect for the audience member, as potentially concerned and able to make sense of his or her political environment

This proposal has inspired a lot of discussions over whether the news media are actually fulfilling the requirements that a well functioning democracy requires.
Commercial mass media are generally not accountable to anybody but their owners, and they have no obligation to serve a democratic function. They are controlled mainly by economic market forces. Fierce economic competition may force the mass media to divert themselves from any democratic ideals and focus entirely on how to survive the competition.

The tabloidization and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles. There is more focus on politicians as personalities and less focus on political issues in the popular media. Election campaigns are covered more as horse races and less as debates about ideologies and issues. The dominating media focus on spin, conflict, and competitive strategies has made voters perceive the politicians as egoists rather than idealists. This fosters mistrust and a cynical attitude to politics, less civic engagement, and less interest in voting.
The ability to find effective political solutions to social problems is hampered when problems tend to be blamed on individuals rather than on structural causes.
This person-centered focus may have far-reaching consequences not only for domestic problems but also for foreign policy when international conflicts are blamed on foreign heads of state rather than on political and economic structures.
A strong media focus on fear and terrorism has allowed military logic to penetrate public institutions, leading to increased surveillance and the erosion of civil rights.

The responsiveness and accountability of the democratic system is compromised when lack of access to substantive, diverse, and undistorted information is handicapping the citizens&#x27; capability of evaluating the political process.
The fast pace and trivialization in the competitive news media is dumbing down the political debate. Thorough and balanced investigation of complex political issues does not fit into this format. The political communication is characterized by short time horizons, short slogans, simple explanations, and simple solutions. This is conducive to political populism rather than serious deliberation.

Commercial mass media are often differentiated along the political spectrum so that people can hear mainly opinions that they already agree with. Too much controversy and diverse opinions are not always profitable for the commercial news media.
Political polarization is emerging when different people read different news and watch different TV channels. This polarization has been worsened by the emergence of the social media that allow people to communicate mainly with groups of like-minded people, the so-called echo chambers.
Extreme political polarization may undermine the trust in democratic institutions, leading to erosion of civil rights and free speech and in some cases even reversion to autocracy.

Many media scholars have discussed non-commercial news media with public service obligations as a means to improve the democratic process by providing the kind of political contents that a free market does not provide.
The World Bank has recommended public service broadcasting in order to strengthen democracy in developing countries. These broadcasting services should be accountable to an independent regulatory body that is adequately protected from interference from political and economic interests.
Public service media have an obligation to provide reliable information to voters. Many countries have publicly funded radio and television stations with public service obligations, especially in Europe and Japan, while such media are weak or non-existent in other countries including the US.
Several studies have shown that the stronger the dominance of commercial broadcast media over public service media, the less the amount of policy-relevant information in the media and the more focus on horse race journalism, personalities, and the pecadillos of politicians. Public service broadcasters are characterized by more policy-relevant information and more respect for journalistic norms and impartiality than the commercial media. However, the trend of deregulation has put the public service model under increased pressure from competition with commercial media.

The emergence of the internet and the social media has profoundly altered the conditions for political communication. The social media have given ordinary citizens easy access to voice their opinion and share information while bypassing the filters of the large news media. This is often seen as an advantage for democracy. The new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way social movements and protest movements operate and organize. The internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and emerging democracies, enabling them to bypass censorship, voice their opinions, and organize protests.

A serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters. The established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy, while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information. In fact, studies show that false stories are going more viral than true stories.
The proliferation of false stories and conspiracy theories may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials.

Reliable information sources are essential for the democratic process. Less democratic governments rely heavily on censorship, propaganda, and misinformation in order to stay in power, while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy.

===Democracy promotion===
Democracy promotion can increase the quality of already existing democracies, reduce political apathy, and the chance of democratic backsliding. Democracy promotion measures include voting advice applications, participatory democracy, increasing youth suffrage, increasing civic education, reducing barriers to entry for new political parties, increasing proportionality and reducing presidentialism.

<doc id="7962" wikidata="Q1651704" url="?curid=7962" title="Logical disjunction">
<text>In logic, disjunction, also known as logical disjunction or logical or or logical addition or inclusive disjunction, is a logical connective typically notated as formula_1 and read aloud as &quot;or&quot;. For instance, the English language sentence &quot;it is sunny or it is warm&quot; can be represented in logic using the disjunctive formula formula_2, assuming that formula_3 abbreviates &quot;it is sunny&quot; and formula_4 abbreviates &quot;it is warm&quot;.

In classical logic, disjunction is given a truth functional semantics according to which a formula formula_5 is true unless both formula_6 and formula_7 are false. Because this semantics allows a disjunctive formula to be true when both of its disjuncts are true, it is an &quot;inclusive&quot; interpretation of disjunction, in contrast with exclusive disjunction. Classical proof theoretical treatments are often given in terms of rules such as disjunction introduction and disjunction elimination. Disjunction has also been given numerous non-classical treatments, motivated by problems including Aristotle&#x27;s sea battle argument, Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, as well as the numerous mismatches between classical disjunction and its nearest equivalents in natural languages.

An operand of a disjunction is a disjunct.

==Inclusive and exclusive disjunction==

Because the logical &quot;or&quot; means a disjunction formula is true when either one or both of its parts are true, it is referred to as an &quot;inclusive&quot; disjunction. This is in contrast with an exclusive disjunction, which is true when one or the other of the arguments are true, but not both (referred to as &quot;exclusive or&quot;, or &quot;XOR&quot;).

When it is necessary to clarify whether inclusive or exclusive &quot;or&quot; is intended, English speakers sometimes uses the phrase &quot;and/or&quot;. In terms of logic, this phrase is identical to &quot;or&quot;, but makes the inclusion of both being true explicit.

==Notation==
In logic and related fields, disjunction is customarily notated with an infix operator formula_8 (Unicode ). Alternative notations include formula_9, used mainly in electronics, as well as formula_10 and formula_11 in many programming languages. The English word &quot;or&quot; is sometimes used as well, often in capital letters. In Jan Łukasiewicz&#x27;s prefix notation for logic, the operator is formula_12, short for Polish &quot;alternatywa&quot; (English: alternative).

In mathematics, the disjunction of an arbitrary number of elements formula_13 can be denoted as an iterated binary operation using a larger ⋁ (Unicode ):

formula_14

==Classical disjunction==

=== Semantics ===

In the semantics of logic, classical disjunction is a truth functional operation which returns the truth value &quot;true&quot; unless both of its arguments are &quot;false&quot;. Its semantic entry is standardly given as follows:

:: formula_15     if     formula_16     or     formula_17     or     both

This semantics corresponds to the following truth table:

===Defined by other operators===
In classical logic systems where logical disjunction is not a primitive, it can be defined in terms of the primitive &quot;and&quot; (formula_18) and &quot;not&quot; (formula_19) as:

:formula_20.

Alternatively, it may be defined in terms of &quot;implies&quot; (formula_21) and &quot;not&quot; as:
:formula_22.
The latter can be checked by the following truth table:

It may also be defined solely in terms of formula_21:
:formula_24.
It can be checked by the following truth table:

===Properties===

The following properties apply to disjunction:

*Associativity: formula_25
*Commutativity: formula_26
*Distributivity: formula_27
:::formula_28
:::formula_29
:::formula_30

*Idempotency: formula_31
*Monotonicity: formula_32
:::formula_33

*&quot;Truth-preserving&quot;: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of &#x27;true&#x27;, produces a truth value of &#x27;true&#x27; as a result of disjunction.
*&quot;Falsehood-preserving&quot;: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of &#x27;false&#x27;, produces a truth value of &#x27;false&#x27; as a result of disjunction.

==Applications in computer science==
Operators corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most programming languages.

===Bitwise operation===
Disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 0 or 0 = 0
* 0 or 1 = 1
* 1 or 0 = 1
* 1 or 1 = 1
* 1010 or 1100 = 1110

The codice_1 operator can be used to set bits in a bit field to 1, by codice_1-ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1. For example, codice_3 will force the final bit to 1, while leaving other bits unchanged.

===Logical operation===
Many languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe operator (codice_4), and logical disjunction with the double pipe (codice_5) operator.

Logical disjunction is usually short-circuited; that is, if the first (left) operand evaluates to codice_6, then the second (right) operand is not evaluated. The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a sequence point.

In a parallel (concurrent) language, it is possible to short-circuit both sides: they are evaluated in parallel, and if one terminates with value true, the other is interrupted. This operator is thus called the &quot;parallel or&quot;.

Although the type of a logical disjunction expression is Boolean in most languages (and thus can only have the value codice_6 or codice_8), in some languages (such as Python and JavaScript), the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates to a true value, and the second operand otherwise. This allows it to fulfill the role of the Elvis operator.

===Constructive disjunction===
The Curry–Howard correspondence relates a constructivist form of disjunction to tagged union types.

==Set theory==

The membership of an element of a union set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: formula_34. Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and de Morgan&#x27;s laws, identifying logical conjunction with set intersection, logical negation with set complement.

== Natural language ==

Disjunction in natural languages does not precisely match the interpretation of formula_8 in classical logic. Notably, classical disjunction is inclusive while natural language disjunction is often understood exclusively, as the following English example typically would be.

:* Mary is eating an apple or a pear.

This inference has sometimes been understood as an entailment, for instance by Alfred Tarski, who suggested that natural language disjunction is ambiguous between a classical and a nonclassical interpretation. More recent work in pragmatics has shown that this inference can be derived as a conversational implicature on the basis of a semantic denotation which behaves classically. However, disjunctive constructions including Hungarian &quot;vagy... vagy&quot; and French &quot;soit... soit&quot; have been argued to be inherently exclusive, rendering ungrammaticality in contexts where an inclusive reading would otherwise be forced.

Similar deviations from classical logic have been noted in cases such as free choice disjunction and simplification of disjunctive antecedents, where certain modal operators trigger a conjunction-like interpretation of disjunction. As with exclusivity, these inferences have been analyzed both as implicatures and as entailments arising from a nonclassical interpretation of disjunction.

:* You can have an apple or a pear.
::formula_36 You can have an apple and you can have a pear (but you can&#x27;t have both)

In many languages, disjunctive expressions play a role in question formation.
:* Is Mary a philosopher or a linguist?
For instance, while the above English example can be interpreted as a polar question asking whether it&#x27;s true that Mary is either a philosopher or a linguist, it can also be interpreted as an alternative question asking which of the two professions is hers. The role of disjunction in these cases has been analyzed using nonclassical logics such as alternative semantics and inquisitive semantics, which have also been adopted to explain the free choice and simplification inferences.

In English, as in many other languages, disjunction is expressed by a coordinating conjunction. Other languages express disjunctive meanings in a variety of ways, though it is unknown whether disjunction itself is a linguistic universal. In many languages such as Dyirbal and Maricopa, disjunction is marked using a verb suffix. For instance, in the Maricopa example below, disjunction is marked by the suffix &quot;šaa&quot;.

==Notes==

* George Boole, closely following analogy with ordinary mathematics, premised, as a necessary condition to the definition of x + y, that x and y were mutually exclusive. Jevons, and practically all mathematical logicians after him, advocated, on various grounds, the definition of &quot;logical addition&quot; in a form that does not necessitate mutual exclusiveness.

<text>In classical logic, disjunctive syllogism (historically known as modus tollendo ponens (MTP), Latin for &quot;mode that affirms by denying&quot;) is a valid argument form which is a syllogism having a disjunctive statement for one of its premises.

An example in English:
# I will choose soup or I will choose salad.
# I will not choose soup.
# Therefore, I will choose salad.

==Propositional logic==
In propositional logic, disjunctive syllogism (also known as disjunction elimination and or elimination, or abbreviated ∨E), is a valid rule of inference. If it is known that at least one of two statements is true, and that it is not the former that is true; we can infer that it has to be the latter that is true. Equivalently, if &quot;P&quot; is true or &quot;Q&quot; is true and &quot;P&quot; is false, then &quot;Q&quot; is true. The name &quot;disjunctive syllogism&quot; derives from its being a syllogism, a three-step argument, and the use of a logical disjunction (any &quot;or&quot; statement.) For example, &quot;P or Q&quot; is a disjunction, where P and Q are called the statement&#x27;s &quot;disjuncts&quot;. The rule makes it possible to eliminate a disjunction from a logical proof. It is the rule that

:formula_1

where the rule is that whenever instances of &quot;formula_2&quot;, and &quot;formula_3&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_4&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line.

Disjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to hypothetical syllogism, which is another rule of inference involving a syllogism. It is also related to the law of noncontradiction, one of the three traditional laws of thought.

== Formal notation ==
For a logical system that validates it, the &quot;disjunctive syllogism&quot; may be written in sequent notation as

: formula_5

where formula_6 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_4 is a syntactic consequence of formula_2, and formula_9.

It may be expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem in the object language of propositional logic as

:formula_10

where formula_11, and formula_4 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

== Natural language examples ==
Here is an example:
# It is red or it is blue.
# It is not blue.
# Therefore, it is red.

Here is another example:
# The breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines.
# The breach is not a safety violation.
# Therefore, it is not subject to fines.

==Strong form==
&quot;Modus tollendo ponens&quot; can be made stronger by using exclusive disjunction instead of inclusive disjunction as a premise:

:formula_13

==Related argument forms==
Unlike &quot;modus ponens&quot; and &quot;modus ponendo tollens&quot;, with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of logical systems, as the above arguments can be proven with a combination of reductio ad absurdum and disjunction elimination.

Other forms of syllogism include:
*hypothetical syllogism
*categorical syllogism

Disjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and intuitionistic logic, but not in some paraconsistent logics.

<doc id="7964" wikidata="Q101072" url="?curid=7964" title="Definition">
<text>A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.

In mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what the mathematical term is and is not. Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.

==Basic terminology==
In modern usage, a definition is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the &quot;definiendum&quot;, and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the &quot;definiens&quot;. For example, in the definition &quot;An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa&quot;, the word &quot;elephant&quot; is the &quot;definiendum&quot;, and everything after the word &quot;is&quot; is the &quot;definiens&quot;.

The &quot;definiens&quot; is not &quot;the meaning&quot; of the word defined, but is instead something that &quot;conveys the same meaning&quot; as that word.

There are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, &quot;lexical definitions&quot;, or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; &quot;demonstrative definitions&quot;, which define something by pointing to an example of it (&quot;&quot;This,&quot; [said while pointing to a large grey animal], &quot;is an Asian elephant.&quot;&quot;); and &quot;precising definitions&quot;, which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (&quot;&#x27;Large&#x27;, among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds.&quot;).

==Intensional definitions vs extensional definitions==
An &quot;intensional definition&quot;, also called a &quot;connotative&quot; definition, specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing to be a member of a specific set. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by genus and differentia, is an intensional definition.

An &quot;extensional definition&quot;, also called a &quot;denotative&quot; definition, of a concept or term specifies its &quot;extension&quot;. It is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set.

Thus, the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot; can be defined &quot;intensionally&quot; as those singled out by Pope Gregory I as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An &quot;extensional&quot; definition, on the other hand, would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of &quot;prime minister&quot; might be &quot;the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of parliamentary government&quot;, an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who the future prime ministers will be (even though all prime ministers from the past and present can be listed).

===Classes of intensional definitions===

A &quot;genus–differentia definition&quot; is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category (the &quot;genus&quot;) and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the &quot;differentia&quot;).

More formally, a genus–differentia definition consists of:
* &quot;a genus&quot; (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
* &quot;the differentia&quot;: The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus.

For example, consider the following genus–differentia definitions:
* &quot;a triangle&quot;: A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides.
* &quot;a quadrilateral&quot;: A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.

Those definitions can be expressed as a genus (&quot;a plane figure&quot;) and two &quot;differentiae&quot; (&quot;that has three straight bounding sides&quot; and &quot;that has four straight bounding sides&quot;, respectively).

It is also possible to have two different genus–differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus–differentia definitions of &quot;square&quot; are equally acceptable:
* &quot;a square&quot;: a rectangle that is a rhombus.
* &quot;a square&quot;: a rhombus that is a rectangle.

Thus, a &quot;square&quot; is a member of both genera (the plural of &quot;genus&quot;): the genus &quot;rectangle&quot; and the genus &quot;rhombus&quot;.

===Classes of extensional definitions===
One important form of the extensional definition is &quot;ostensive definition&quot;. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. For example, one can explain who &quot;Alice&quot; (an individual) is, by pointing her out to another; or what a &quot;rabbit&quot; (a class) is, by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

An &quot;enumerative definition&quot; of a concept or a term is an &quot;extensional definition&quot; that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the objects that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets (and only practical for small sets).

===&quot;Divisio&quot; and &quot;partitio&quot;===
&quot;Divisio&quot; and &quot;partitio&quot; are classical terms for definitions. A &quot;partitio&quot; is simply an intensional definition. A &quot;divisio&quot; is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of subsets of a set, in the sense that every member of the &quot;divided&quot; set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of &quot;divisio&quot; lists all sets whose only member is a member of the &quot;divided&quot; set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list &quot;members&quot;, and not &quot;subsets&quot;.

===Nominal definitions vs real definitions===

In classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. Aristotle had it that an object&#x27;s essential attributes form its &quot;essential nature&quot;, and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.

The idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between &quot;nominal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; essence—a distinction originating with Aristotle. In the Posterior Analytics, he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example &quot;goat stag&quot;) without knowing what he calls the &quot;essential nature&quot; of the thing that the name would denote (if there were such a thing). This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the &quot;quid nominis&quot;, or the &quot;whatness of the name&quot;, and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the &quot;quid rei&quot;, or the &quot;whatness of the thing&quot;. The name &quot;hobbit&quot;, for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a &quot;quid nominis&quot;, but one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the &quot;quid rei&quot; of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name &quot;man&quot; denotes real things (men) that have a certain &quot;quid rei&quot;. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that a thing must have in order that the name apply to it.

This leads to a corresponding distinction between &quot;nominal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means (i.e., which says what the &quot;nominal essence&quot; is), and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or &quot;quid rei&quot; of the thing.

This preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. Analytic philosophy, in particular, is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. Russell described essence as &quot;a hopelessly muddle-headed notion&quot;.

More recently Kripke&#x27;s formalisation of possible world semantics in modal logic led to a new approach to essentialism. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are &quot;necessary&quot; to it, they are those things that it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as rigid designators.

==Operational vs. theoretical definitions==
A definition may also be classified as an operational definition or theoretical definition.

==Terms with multiple definitions==

===Homonyms===

A homonym is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings. Thus homonyms are simultaneously homographs (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) &quot;and&quot; homophones (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling). The state of being a homonym is called &quot;homonymy&quot;. Examples of homonyms are the pair &quot;stalk&quot; (part of a plant) and &quot;stalk&quot; (follow/harass a person) and the pair &quot;left&quot; (past tense of leave) and &quot;left&quot; (opposite of right). A distinction is sometimes made between &quot;true&quot; homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as &quot;skate&quot; (glide on ice) and &quot;skate&quot; (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or polysemes, which have a shared origin, such as &quot;mouth&quot; (of a river) and &quot;mouth&quot; (of an animal).

===Polysemes===

Polysemy is the capacity for a sign (such as a word, phrase, or symbol) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple semes or sememes and thus multiple senses), usually related by contiguity of meaning within a semantic field. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from homonymy, in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.

==In logic, mathematics and computing==
In mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to describe or characterize a concept. For naming the object of a definition mathematicians can use either a neologism (this was mainly the case in the past) or words or phrases of the common language (this is generally the case in modern mathematics). The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different from the English definition of the word used, which can lead to confusion, particularly when the meanings are close. For example, a set is not exactly the same thing in mathematics and in common language. In some case, the word used can be misleading; for example, a real number has nothing more (or less) real than an imaginary number. Frequently, a definition uses a phrase built with common English words, which has no meaning outside mathematics, such as primitive group or irreducible variety.

In first-order logic definitions are usually introduced using extension by definition (so using a metalogic). On the other hand, lambda-calculi are a kind of logic where the definitions are included as the feature of the formal system itself.

===Classification===
Authors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics. Norman Swartz classifies a definition as &quot;stipulative&quot; if it is intended to guide a specific discussion. A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction. In contrast, a &quot;descriptive&quot; definition can be shown to be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; with reference to general usage.

Swartz defines a &quot;precising definition&quot; as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.

C.L. Stevenson has identified &quot;persuasive definition&quot; as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;commonly accepted&quot; meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;coercive&quot; – their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.

===Recursive definitions===
A recursive definition, sometimes also called an &quot;inductive&quot; definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:
# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a &quot;base set&quot;.
# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition recursive.
# All other things are excluded from the set

For instance, we could define a natural number as follows (after Peano): 
# &quot;0&quot; is a natural number.
# Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:
#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;
#* distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;
#* no natural number is succeeded by &quot;0&quot;.
# Nothing else is a natural number.

So &quot;0&quot; will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called &quot;1&quot;. In turn, &quot;1&quot; will have exactly one successor, which could be called &quot;2&quot;, and so on. The second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves self-reference. Although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity, it is not vicious, and the definition has been quite successful.

In the same way, we can define ancestor as follows:
#A parent is an ancestor.
#A parent of an ancestor is an ancestor.
#Nothing else is an ancestor.
Or simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.

==In medicine==
In medical dictionaries, guidelines and other consensus statements and classifications, definitions should as far as possible be:
*simple and easy to understand, preferably even by the general public;
*useful clinically or in related areas where the definition will be used;
*specific (that is, by reading the definition only, it should ideally not be possible to refer to any other entity than that being defined);
*measurable;
*a reflection of current scientific knowledge.

==Problems==

Certain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).
*A definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.
*Definitions should avoid circularity. To define a horse as &quot;a member of the species &quot;equus&quot;&quot; would convey no information whatsoever. For this reason, Locke adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it. This would be a circular definition, a &quot;circulus in definiendo&quot;. Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other. Clearly, we cannot define &quot;antecedent&quot; without using the term &quot;consequent&quot;, nor conversely.
*The definition must not be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).
*The definition must not be obscure. The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear. The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term &quot;obscurum per obscurius&quot;. However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity.
*A definition should not be negative where it can be positive. We should not define &quot;wisdom&quot; as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick. Sometimes this is unavoidable, however. For example, it appears difficult to define blindness in positive terms rather than as &quot;the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted&quot;.

===Fallacies of definition===
===Limitations of definition===
Given that a natural language such as English contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon primitive notions. If every term of every &quot;definiens&quot; must itself be defined, &quot;where at last should we stop?&quot; A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions, must resort to circularity.

Many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The scholastic philosophers claimed that the highest genera (called the ten &quot;generalissima&quot;) cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus being, unity and similar concepts cannot be defined. Locke supposes in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently Bertrand Russell sought to develop a formal language based on logical atoms. Other philosophers, notably Wittgenstein, rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; that what counts as a &quot;simple&quot; in one circumstance might not do so in another. He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: &quot;As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one&quot;, claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.

Locke and Mill also argued that individuals cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used. This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has &quot;fallen under our notice&quot;. Russell offered his theory of descriptions in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a definite description that &quot;picks out&quot; exactly one individual. Saul Kripke pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to modality, in his book &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;.

There is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the &quot;definiens&quot; can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case. The examples he used include &quot;game&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;family&quot;. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a family resemblance. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the &quot;use&quot; of the term.

<doc id="7966" wikidata="Q58339" url="?curid=7966" title="Disco">
<text>Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the late 1960s from the United States&#x27; urban nightlife scene. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, brass and horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.

Discothèques as a venue were mostly a French invention, imported to the United States with the opening of Le Club, a members-only restaurant and nightclub located at 416 East 55th Street in Manhattan, by French expatriate Olivier Coquelin, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1960.

Disco music as a genre started as a mixture of music from venues popular among African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, gay Americans, and Italian Americans in New York City (especially Brooklyn) and Philadelphia during the late 1960s to the mid-to-late 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the 1960s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of 70s disco&#x27;s popularity in the United States, including &quot;the Bump&quot;, &quot;the Hustle&quot;, &quot;the Watergate&quot;, and &quot;the Busstop&quot;.

During the 1970s, disco music was developed further, mainly by artists from the United States as well as from Europe. Well-known artists included the Bee Gees, ABBA, Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Giorgio Moroder, Baccara, The Jacksons, Michael Jackson, Boney M, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Rick James, ELO, Average White Band, Chaka Khan, Chic, KC and the Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Sister Sledge, Sylvester, The Trammps, Barry White, Diana Ross, Kool &amp; the Gang, and Village People. While performers garnered public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in Manhattan, a venue popular among celebrities. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, consisting predominantly of loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and quaaludes, the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed &quot;disco biscuits&quot;. Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history. Films such as &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977) and &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; (1978) contributed to disco&#x27;s mainstream popularity.

Disco declined as a major trend in popular music in the United States following the infamous Disco Demolition Night on July 12, 1979, and it continued to sharply decline in popularity in the U.S. during the early 1980s; however, it remained popular in Italy and some European countries throughout the 1980s, and during this time also started becoming trendy in places elsewhere including India and the Middle East, where aspects of disco were blended with regional folk styles such as &quot;ghazals&quot; and belly dancing. Disco would eventually become a key influence in the development of electronic dance music, house music, hip hop, new wave, dance-punk, and post-disco. The style has had several revivals since the 1990s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. A revival has been underway since the early 2010s, coming to great popularity in the early 2020s. Albums that have contributed to this revival include &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, &quot;Future Nostalgia&quot;, and Kylie Minogue&#x27;s album itself titled &quot;Disco&quot;. Modern day artists like Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic have continued the genre&#x27;s popularity, bringing it to a whole new younger generation.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;disco&quot; is shorthand for the word &quot;discothèque&quot;, a French word for &quot;library of phonograph records&quot; derived from &quot;bibliothèque&quot;. The word &quot;discotheque&quot; had the same meaning in English in the 1950s. &quot;Discothèque&quot; became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris, after they had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960, it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;Discotheque&quot; as &quot;A dance hall, nightclub, or similar venue where recorded music is played for dancing, typically equipped with a large dance floor, an elaborate system of flashing coloured lights, and a powerful amplified sound system. &quot; Its earliest example is use as the name of a particular venue in 1952, and other examples date from 1960 onwards. The entry is annotated as &quot;Now somewhat dated&quot;. It defines &quot;Disco&quot; as &quot;A genre of strongly rhythmical pop music mainly intended for dancing in nightclubs and particularly popular in the mid to late 1970s.&quot;, with use from 1975 onwards, describing the origin of the word as a shortened form of &quot;discotheque&quot;.

In the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called the &quot;discotheque dress&quot; was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form &quot;disco&quot; described this dress and has been found in &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; on July 12, 1964; &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.

Vince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the 13 September 1973 feature article &quot;Discotheque Rock &#x27;72: Paaaaarty!&quot; that appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

==Musical characteristics==

The music typically layered soaring, often-reverberated vocals, often doubled by horns, over a background &quot;pad&quot; of electric pianos and &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; rhythm guitars played on an electric guitar. Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock. &quot;The &quot;rooster scratch&quot; sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge.&quot; Other backing keyboard instruments include the piano, electric organ (during early years), string synthesizers, and electromechanical keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes electric piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Donna Summer&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, produced by Giorgio Moroder with a prominent Moog synthesizer on the beat, was one of the first disco tracks to use the synthesizer.

The rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of broken octaves, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the bass guitar and by drummers using a drum kit, African/Latin percussion, and electronic drums such as Simmons and Roland drum modules. In Philly dance and Salsoul disco, the sound was enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as violin, viola, cello, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, flugelhorn, French horn, English horn, oboe, flute, timpani and synth strings, string section or a full string orchestra.

Most disco songs have a steady four-on-the-floor beat set by a bass drum, a quaver or semi-quaver hi-hat pattern with an open hissing hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. A recording error in the 1975 song &quot;Bad Luck&quot; by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes where Earl Young&#x27;s hi-hat was too loud in the recording is said to have established loud hi-hats in disco. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin polyrhythms, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.

Songs often use syncopation, which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or pop song is that in dance music the bass drum hits &quot;four to the floor&quot;, at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes (as shown in the second drum pattern in the picture above, after a typical rock drum pattern).

The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich &quot;wall of sound&quot;. There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation.

Harmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords, which are found more often in jazz than pop music.

==Production==
The &quot;disco sound&quot; was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of funk, soul music of the late 1960s or the small jazz organ trios, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a horn section, a string orchestra, and a variety of &quot;classical&quot; solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).

Disco songs were arranged and composed by experienced arrangers and orchestrators, and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using multitrack recording techniques and effects units. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a conductor, copyists, record producers, and mixing engineers. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process because disco songs used as many as 64 tracks of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and breaks. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the &quot;disco sound&quot; by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated disco mix.

Early records were the &quot;standard&quot; three-minute version until Tom Moulton came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl singles of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five minutes of good-quality music. With the help of José Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10&quot; disc instead of 7&quot;. They cut the next single on a 12&quot; disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. 12&quot; single records, also known as &quot;Maxi singles&quot;, quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.

==Club culture==
===Nightclubs===
By the late 1970s, most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were most notably in New York City but also in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, D.C. The scene was centered on discotheques, nightclubs and private loft parties.

In the 1970s, notable discos included &quot;Crisco Disco&quot;, &quot;The Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Leviticus&quot;, &quot;Studio 54&quot;, and &quot;Paradise Garage&quot; in New York, &quot;Artemis&quot; in Philadelphia, &quot;Studio One&quot; in Los Angeles, &quot;Dugan&#x27;s Bistro&quot; in Chicago, and &quot;The Library&quot; in Atlanta.

In the late 1970s, Studio 54 in Midtown Manhattan was arguably the best-known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture in general. It was operated by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager and was notorious for the hedonism that went on within: the balconies were known for sexual encounters and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; that included an animated cocaine spoon.

The &quot;Copacabana&quot;, another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a Barry Manilow song of the same name.

In Washington, D.C., large disco clubs such as &quot;The Pier&quot; (&quot;Pier 9&quot;) and &quot;The Other Side&quot;, originally regarded exclusively as &quot;gay bars&quot;, became particularly popular among the capital area&#x27;s gay and straight college students in the late &#x27;70s.

By 1979 there were 15,000-20,000 disco nightclubs in the US, many of them opening in suburban shopping centers, hotels, and restaurants. The 2001 Club franchises were the most prolific chain of disco clubs in the country. Although many other attempts were made to franchise disco clubs, 2001 was the only one to successfully do so in this time frame.

===Sound and light equipment===
Powerful, bass-heavy, hi-fi sound systems were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. The Loft party host David Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of subwoofers positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade sound engineers such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.&quot;

Typical lighting designs for disco dance floors include multi-colored lights that swirl around or flash to the beat, strobe lights, an illuminated dance floor, and a mirror ball.

===DJs===
Disco-era disc jockeys (DJs) would often remix existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines, and add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a DJ mixer and using a microphone to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as reverb, equalization, and echo effects unit. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer&#x27;s crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include Francis Grasso of The Sanctuary, David Mancuso of The Loft, Frankie Knuckles of the Chicago Warehouse, Larry Levan of the Paradise Garage, Nicky Siano of The Gallery, Walter Gibbons, Karen Mixon Cook, Jim Burgess, John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez, Richie Kulala of Studio 54, and Rick Salsalini.

Some DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the recording studio. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific record producer as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in the nightclubs, DJs were also influential in the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.

===Dance===
In the early years, dancers in discos danced in a &quot;hang loose&quot; or &quot;freestyle&quot; approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the &quot;Bump&quot;, &quot;Penguin&quot;, &quot;Boogaloo&quot;, &quot;Watergate&quot;, and &quot;Robot&quot;. By October 1975 the Hustle reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated, and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, New York Hustle, and Latin Hustle.

During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as &quot;touch dancing&quot;, &quot;the hustle&quot;, and &quot;the cha cha&quot;. The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book &quot;The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing&quot; (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner, and line dances. The book topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German, and French.

In Chicago, the &quot;Step By Step&quot; disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that Don Cornelius used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;&#x27;s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show aired on Saturday mornings and had a strong following. Its viewers would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as &quot;Disco Night at White Sox Park&quot;.

In Sacramento, California, Disco King Paul Dale Roberts danced for the Guinness Book of World Records. He danced for 205 hours, the equivalent of 8½ days. Other dance marathons took place afterward and Roberts held the world record for disco dancing for a short period of time.

Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included Pan&#x27;s People and Hot Gossip. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). Further influence came from the music and dance style of such films as &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982), &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as &quot;Dance Fever&quot; (1979).

===Fashion===
Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore glamorous, expensive, and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as Halston dresses, or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless halter tops, disco pants, &quot;hot pants&quot;, or body-hugging spandex bodywear or &quot;catsuits&quot;. Men would wear shiny polyester Qiana shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore Pierre Cardin suits, three piece suits with a vest, and double-knit polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. Men&#x27;s leisure suits were typically form-fitted to some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom while the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style, to permit freedom of movement.

During the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, activities that would have been considered &quot;feminine&quot; according to the gender stereotypes of the era. Women dancers wore glitter makeup, sequins, or gold lamé clothing that would shimmer under the lights. Bold colors were popular for both genders. Platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear. Necklaces and medallions were a common fashion accessory. Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in drag, covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups were more likely to be seen at invitation-only New York City loft parties and disco clubs.

===Drug subculture===
In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving club drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud, bass-heavy music and the flashing colored lights, such as cocaine (nicknamed &quot;blow&quot;), amyl nitrite (&quot;poppers&quot;), and the &quot;... other quintessential 1970s club drug Quaalude, which suspended motor coordination and gave the sensation that one&#x27;s arms and legs had turned to &#x27;Jell-O. Quaaludes were so popular at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed &quot;disco biscuits&quot;.

Paul Gootenberg states that &quot;[t]he relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough...&quot; During the 1970s, the use of cocaine by well-to-do celebrities led to its &quot;glamorization&quot; and to the widely held view that it was a &quot;soft drug&quot;. LSD, marijuana, and &quot;speed&quot; (amphetamines) were also popular in disco clubs, and the use of these drugs &quot;...contributed to the hedonistic quality of the dance floor experience.&quot; Since disco dances were typically held in liquor licensed-nightclubs and dance clubs, alcoholic drinks were also consumed by dancers; some users intentionally combined alcohol with the consumption of other drugs, such as Quaaludes, for a stronger effect.

===Eroticism and sexual liberation===
According to Peter Braunstein, the &quot;massive quantities of drugs ingested in discothèques produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of &#x27;main course&#x27; in a hedonist&#x27;s menu for a night out.&quot; At The Saint nightclub, a high percentage of the gay male dancers and patrons would have sex in the club; they typically had unprotected sex, because in 1980, HIV-AIDS had not yet been identified. At The Saint, &quot;dancers would elope to an unpoliced upstairs balcony to engage in sex.&quot; The promiscuity and public sex at discos was part of a broader trend towards exploring a freer sexual expression in the 1970s, an era that is also associated with &quot;swingers clubs, hot tubs, [and] key parties.&quot;

In his paper, &quot;In Defense of Disco&quot; (1979), Richard Dyer claims eroticism as one of the three main characteristics of disco. As opposed to rock music which has a very phallic centered eroticism focusing on the sexual pleasure of men over other persons, Dyer describes disco as featuring a non-phallic full body eroticism. Through a range of percussion instruments, a willingness to play with rhythm, and the endless repeating of phrases without cutting the listener off, disco achieved this full-body eroticism by restoring eroticism to the whole body for both sexes. This allowed for the potential expression of sexualities not defined by the cock/penis, and the erotic pleasure of bodies that are not defined by a relationship to a penis. The sexual liberation expressed through the rhythm of disco is further represented in the club spaces that disco grew within.

In Peter Shapiro&#x27;s &quot;: Throbbing Words on Sound&quot;, he discusses eroticism through the technology disco utilizes to create its audacious sound. The music, Shapiro states, is adjunct to &quot;the pleasure-is-politics ethos of post-Stonewall culture.&quot; He explains how &quot;mechano-eroticism&quot;, which links the technology used to create the unique mechanical sound of disco to eroticism, set the genre in a new dimension of reality living outside of naturalism and heterosexuality. Randy Jones and Mark Jacobsen echo this sentiment in BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Politics of Dancing: How Disco Changed the World,&quot; describing the loose, hip-focused dance style as &quot;a new kind of communion&quot; that celebrates the sparks of liberation brought on the Stonewall riots. As New York state had laws against homosexual behavior in public, including dancing with a member of the same sex, the eroticism of disco served as resistance and an expression of sexual freedom.

He uses Donna Summer&#x27;s singles &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; (1975) and &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (1977) as examples of the ever-present relationship between the synthesized bass lines and backgrounds to the simulated sounds of orgasms. Summer&#x27;s voice echoes in the tracks, and likens them to the drug-fervent, sexually liberated fans of disco who sought to free themselves through disco&#x27;s &quot;aesthetic of machine sex.&quot; Shapiro sees this as an influence that creates sub-genres like hi-NRG and dub-disco, which allowed for eroticism and technology to be further explored through intense synth bass lines and alternative rhythmic techniques that tap into the entire body rather than the obvious erotic parts of the body.

The New York nightclub The Sanctuary under resident DJ Francis Grasso is a prime example of this sexual liberty. In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as &quot;poured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality.&quot; The Sanctuary was the &quot;first totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America&quot; and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, bathrooms. and hallways of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy-like sexual engagements.

By describing the music, drugs, and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex, and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. It supports the argument that disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. The recent legalization of abortion and the introduction of antibiotics and the pill facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment. Thus was fostered a very sex-positive framework around discotheques.

Further, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as an illness. This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. David Mancuso&#x27;s club/house party, The Loft, was described as having a &quot;pansexual attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually carried bail money with them.&quot;

==History==
===1940s–1960s: First discotheques===
Disco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band. The first discotheques mostly played swing music. Later on, uptempo rhythm and blues became popular in American clubs and northern soul and glam rock records in the UK. In the early 1940s, nightclubs in Paris resorted to playing jazz records during the Nazi occupation.

Régine Zylberberg claimed to have started the first discotheque and to have been the first club DJ in 1953 in the &quot;Whisky à Go-Go&quot; in Paris. She installed a dance floor with colored lights and two turntables so she could play records without having a gap in the music. In October 1959, the owner of the Scotch Club in Aachen, West Germany chose to install a record player for the opening night instead of hiring a live band. The patrons were unimpressed until a young reporter, who happened to be covering the opening of the club, impulsively took control of the record player and introduced the records that he chose to play. Klaus Quirini later claimed to thus have been the world&#x27;s first nightclub DJ.

===1960s–1974: Precursors and early disco music===
During the 1960s, discotheque dancing became a European trend that was enthusiastically picked up by the American press. At this time, when the discotheque culture from Europe became popular in the United States, several music genres with danceable rhythms rose to popularity and evolved into different sub-genres: rhythm and blues (originated in the 1940s), soul (late 1950s and 1960s), funk (mid-1960s) and go-go (mid-1960s and 1970s; more than &quot;disco&quot;, the word &quot;go-go&quot; originally indicated a music club). Musical genres that were primarily performed by African-American musicians would influence much of early disco.

Also during the 1960s, the Motown record label developed its own approach, described as having &quot;1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were halfway between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio.&quot; Motown had many hits with disco elements by acts like Eddie Kendricks (&quot; Girl You Need a Change of Mind&quot; in 1972, &quot;Keep on Truckin&#x27;&quot; in 1973, &quot;Boogie Down&quot; in 1974).

At the end of the 1960s, musicians, and audiences from the Black, Italian, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippie and psychedelia subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like MFSB&#x27;s album &quot;Love Is the Message&quot;.
Partly through the success of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelic elements that were popular in rock music of the late 1960s found their way into soul and early funk music and formed the subgenre psychedelic soul. Examples can be found in the music of the Chambers Brothers, George Clinton with his Parliament-Funkadelic collective, Sly and the Family Stone, and the productions of Norman Whitfield with The Temptations.

The long instrumental introductions and detailed orchestration found in psychedelic soul tracks by the Temptations are also considered as cinematic soul. In the early 1970s, Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes scored hits with cinematic soul songs that were actually composed for movie soundtracks: &quot;Superfly&quot; (1972) and &quot;Theme from Shaft&quot; (1971). The latter is sometimes regarded as an early disco song. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Philadelphia soul developed as a sub-genre that also had lavish percussion, lush string orchestra arrangements, and expensive record production processes. In the early 1970s, the Philadelphia soul productions by Gamble and Huff evolved from the simpler arrangements of the late-1960s into a style featuring lush strings, thumping basslines, and sliding hi-hat rhythms. These elements would become typical for disco music and are found in several of the hits they produced in the early 1970s:
*&quot;Love Train&quot; by the O&#x27;Jays (with MFSB as the backup band) was released in 1972 and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 1973
*&quot;The Love I Lost&quot; by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes (1973)
*&quot;Now That We Found Love&quot; by The O&#x27;Jays (1973), later a hit for Third World in 1978
*&quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot; by MFSB with vocals by The Three Degrees, a wordless song written as the theme for &quot;Soul Train&quot; and a #1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1974

Other early disco tracks that helped shape disco and became popular on the dance floors of (underground) discotheque clubs and parties include: 
* &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; by The Chakachas was first released in Belgium in 1971 and later released in the U.S. in 1972, where it reached #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that same year
* &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; by Manu Dibango was first released in France in 1972; it was picked up by the underground disco scene in New York and subsequently got a proper release in the U.S., reaching #35 on the Hot 100 in 1973
* &quot;The Night&quot; by the Four Seasons was released in 1972, but was not immediately popular; it appealed to the Northern soul scene and became a hit in the UK in 1975
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot; by the Love Unlimited Orchestra, conducted by Barry White, an instrumental song originally featured on &quot;Under the Influence of... Love Unlimited&quot; in July 1973 from which it was culled as a single in November of that year; subsequently, the conductor included it on his own debut album
* &quot;Sound Your Funky Horn&quot; by KC and the Sunshine Band in 1974
* &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; by George McCrae in 1974
* &quot;Do It&quot; by B.T. Express in 1974
* &quot;Boogie Down&quot; by Eddie Kendricks in 1974
* &quot;If You Talk In Your Sleep&quot; by Elvis Presley in 1974.

Early disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as Salsoul Records (Ken, Stanley, and Joseph Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter). The genre was also shaped by Tom Moulton, who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs — thus creating the extended mix or &quot;remix&quot;, going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12&quot; record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the &quot;disco sound&quot; included David Mancuso, Nicky Siano, Shep Pettibone, Larry Levan, Walter Gibbons, and Chicago-based Frankie Knuckles. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.

Disco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 1971 hosted by Don Cornelius, then Marty Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Disco Step-by-Step Television Show&quot; in 1975, Steve Marcus&#x27;s &quot;Disco Magic/Disco 77&quot;, Eddie Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Soap Factory&quot;, and Merv Griffin&#x27;s &quot;Dance Fever&quot;, hosted by Deney Terrio, who is credited with teaching actor John Travolta to dance for his role in the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), as well as DANCE, based out of Columbia, South Carolina.

In 1974, New York City&#x27;s WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.

====Early disco culture in the United States====
In the 1970s, the key counterculture of the 1960s, the hippie movement, was fading away. The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation, and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of race riots, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, and the Watergate scandal, left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless. The start of the &#x27;70s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues. The non-partnered dance style of disco music allowed people of all races and sexual orientations to enjoy the dancefloor atmosphere.

In &quot;Beautiful Things in Popular Culture&quot;, Simon Frith highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. &quot;The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city&#x27;s complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie&quot;, he says. &quot;The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.&quot;

The explosion of disco is often claimed to be found in the private dance parties held by New York City DJ David Mancuso&#x27;s home that became known as The Loft, an invitation-only non-commercial underground club that inspired many others. He organized the first major party in his Manhattan home on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1970 with the name &quot;Love Saves The Day&quot;. After some months the parties became weekly events and Mancuso continued to give regular parties into the 1990s. Mancuso required that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.

When Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the gay community (which made up much of The Loft&#x27;s attendee roster) was often harassed in the gay bars and dance clubs, with many gay men carrying bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private discotheques, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso&#x27;s underground, yet legal, policies. Vince Aletti described it &quot;like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn&#x27;t any sense of someone being more important than anyone else,&quot; and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying &quot;It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert called the popular embrace of disco&#x27;s exuberant dance moves an escape from &quot;the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies.&quot; Pauline Kael, writing about the disco-themed film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, said the film and disco itself touched on &quot;something deeply romantic, the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you&#x27;d like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary.&quot;

====Early disco culture in the United Kingdom====
In the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British mod scene and formed the northern soul movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent), and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks, and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials and Jackie Wilson.

In 1974, there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events. Glam rock tracks were popular, with, for example, Gary Glitter&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; becoming popular on UK dance floors while it did not get much radio airplay.

===1974–1977: Rise to mainstream===
From 1974 to 1977, disco music increased in popularity as many disco songs topped the charts. The Hues Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; (1974), a US number-one single and million-seller, was one of the early disco songs to reach number one. The same year saw the release of &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;, performed by Carl Douglas and produced by Biddu, which reached number one in both the UK and US, and became the best-selling single of the year and one of the best-selling singles of all time with 11 million records sold worldwide, helping to popularize disco to a great extent. Another notable disco success that year was George McCrae&#x27;s &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot;: it became the United Kingdom&#x27;s first number one disco single.

In the northwestern sections of the United Kingdom, the northern soul explosion, which started in the late 1960s and peaked in 1974, made the region receptive to disco, which the region&#x27;s disc jockeys were bringing back from New York City. The shift by some DJs to the newer sounds coming from the U.S. resulted in a split in the scene, whereby some abandoned the 1960s soul and pushed a modern soul sound which tended to be more closely aligned with disco than soul.
In 1975, Gloria Gaynor released her first side-long vinyl album, which included a remake of the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; (which, in fact, is also the album title) and two other songs, &quot;Honey Bee&quot; and her disco version of &quot;Reach Out (I&#x27;ll Be There)&quot;. The album first topped the Billboard disco/dance charts in November 1974. Later in 1978, Gaynor&#x27;s number-one disco song was &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, which was seen as a symbol of female strength and a gay anthem, like her further disco hit, a 1983 remake of &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;. In 1979 she released &quot;Let Me Know (I Have a Right)&quot;, a single which gained popularity in the civil rights movements. Also in 1975, Vincent Montana Jr.&#x27;s Salsoul Orchestra contributed with their Latin-flavored orchestral dance song &quot;Salsoul Hustle&quot;, reaching number four on the Billboard Dance Chart; their 1976 hits were &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Naasty&quot;, the first being a cover of a 1941 song.
Songs such as Van McCoy&#x27;s 1975 &quot;The Hustle&quot; and the humorous Joe Tex 1977 &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)&quot; gave names to the popular disco dances &quot;the Bump&quot; and &quot;the Hustle&quot;. Other notable early successful disco songs include Barry White&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re the First, the Last, My Everything&quot; (1974); Labelle&#x27;s &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (1974)&#x27;; Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes&#x27; &quot;Get Dancin&#x27;&quot; (1974); Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s &quot;Shining Star&quot; (1975); Silver Convention&#x27;s &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot; (1975) and &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot; (1976); Vicki Sue Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot; (1976); and &quot;More, More, More&quot; (1976) by Andrea True (a former pornographic actress during the Golden Age of Porn, an era largely contemporaneous with the height of disco).

Formed by Harry Wayne Casey (a.k.a. &quot;KC&quot;) and Richard Finch, Miami&#x27;s KC and the Sunshine Band had a string of disco-definitive top-five singles between 1975 and 1977, including &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;, &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;Boogie Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27; Love&quot;. In this period, rock bands like the English Electric Light Orchestra featured in their songs a violin sound that became a staple of disco music, as in the 1975 hit &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, although the genre was correctly described as orchestral rock.

Other disco producers such as Tom Moulton took ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the &quot;four on the floor&quot; style that dominated. DJ Larry Levan utilized styles from dub and jazz and remixing techniques to create early versions of house music that sparked the genre.

====Motown turning disco====
Norman Whitfield was an influential producer and songwriter at Motown records, renowned for creating innovative &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; songs with many hits for Marvin Gaye, The Velvelettes, The Temptations, and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. From around the production of the Temptations album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in 1968, he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer, dance-friendly tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. An example of such a long psychedelic soul track is &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12&quot; version in 1972. By the early 70s, many of Whitfield&#x27;s productions evolved more and more towards funk and disco, as heard on albums by the Undisputed Truth and the 1973 album &quot;G.I.T.: Get It Together&quot; by The Jackson 5. The Undisputed Truth, a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot;. Their disco single &quot;You + Me = Love&quot; (number 43) was produced by Whitfield and made number 2 on the US dance chart in 1976.

In 1975, Whitfield left Motown and founded his own label Whitfield records, on which also &quot;You + Me = Love&quot; was released. Whitfield produced some more disco hits, including &quot;Car Wash&quot; (1976) by Rose Royce from the album soundtrack to the 1976 film &quot;Car Wash&quot;. In 1977, singer, songwriter, and producer Willie Hutch, who had been signed to Motown since 1970, now signed with Whitfield&#x27;s new label, and scored a successful disco single with his song &quot;In and Out&quot; in 1982.

Other Motown artists turned to disco as well. Diana Ross embraced the disco sound with her successful 1976 outing &quot;Love Hangover&quot; from her self-titled album. Her 1980 dance classics &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; were written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the group Chic. The Supremes, the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking&quot; and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re My Driving Wheel&quot;.

At the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, Marvin Gaye released &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye&#x27;s songs have disco elements, including &quot;I Want You&quot; (1975). Stevie Wonder released the disco single &quot;Sir Duke&quot; in 1977 as a tribute to Duke Ellington, the influential jazz legend who had died in 1974. Smokey Robinson left the Motown group The Miracles for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot; in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; musical programming format and subgenre of R&amp;B. It contained the disco single &quot;Baby That&#x27;s Backatcha&quot;. Other Motown artists who scored disco hits were Robinson&#x27;s former group, the Miracles, with &quot;Love Machine&quot; (1975), Eddie Kendricks with &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; (1973), the Originals with &quot;Down to Love Town&quot; (1976), and Thelma Houston with her cover of the Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; (1976). The label continued to release successful songs into the 1980s with Rick James&#x27;s &quot;Super Freak&quot; (1981), and the Commodores&#x27; &quot;Lady (You Bring Me Up)&quot; (1981).

Several of Motown&#x27;s solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. Mary Wells, Motown&#x27;s first female superstar with her signature song &quot;My Guy&quot; (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song &quot;Gigolo&quot; in 1980. Jimmy Ruffin, the elder brother of the Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, was also signed to Motown and released his most successful and well-known song &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song &quot;Hold On (To My Love)&quot;, which was written and produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, for his album &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Edwin Starr, known for his Motown protest song &quot;War&quot; (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, &quot;Contact&quot; and &quot;H.A.P.P.Y. Radio&quot;. Kiki Dee became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1970), and two singles &quot;The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday&quot; (1970) and &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot; (1971), the latter giving her first-ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with Elton John&#x27;s The Rocket Record Company, and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston.

Many Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. The Jackson 5, one of Motown&#x27;s premier acts in the early 1970s, left the record company in 1975 (Jermaine Jackson, however, remained with the label) after successful songs like &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1969) and &quot;ABC&quot; (1970), and even the disco song &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; (1974). Renamed as &#x27;the Jacksons&#x27; (as Motown owned the name &#x27;the Jackson 5&#x27;), they went on to find success with disco songs like &quot;Blame It on the Boogie&quot; (1978), &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot; (1979), and &quot;Can You Feel It?&quot; (1981) on the Epic label.

The Isley Brothers, whose short tenure at the company had produced the song &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot; in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like &quot;It&#x27;s a Disco Night (Rock Don&#x27;t Stop)&quot; (1979). Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, who recorded the most successful version of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as &quot;Baby, Don&#x27;t Change Your Mind&quot; (1977) and &quot;Bourgie, Bourgie&quot; (1980) in the disco era. The Detroit Spinners were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot; in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow Detroit native Aretha Franklin, to Atlantic Records, and there had disco songs like &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot; (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Are You Ready for Love&quot;, as well as a medley of the Four Seasons&#x27; song &quot;Working My Way Back to You&quot; and Michael Zager&#x27;s &quot;Forgive Me, Girl&quot;. The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown&#x27;s MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&amp;B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, &quot;Chameleon&quot; (1972) – to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, &quot;The Night&quot;, was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the Northern Soul circuit, reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; (1975) for Warner Curb Records.

====Euro disco====
By far the most successful Euro disco act was ABBA (1972–1982). This Swedish quartet, which sang primarily in English, found success with singles such as &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1974), &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; (1978), &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot; (1979), &quot;Super Trouper&quot; (1980), and their signature smash hit &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (1976).

In the 1970s, Munich, West Germany, music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte made a decisive contribution to disco music with a string of hits for Donna Summer, which became known as the &quot;Munich Sound&quot;. In 1975, Summer suggested the lyric &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; to Moroder and Bellotte, who turned the lyric into a full disco song. The final product, which contained the vocalizations of a series of simulated orgasms, initially was not intended for release, but when Moroder played it in the clubs it caused a sensation and he released it. The song became an international hit, reaching the charts in many European countries and the US (No. 2). It has been described as the arrival of the expression of raw female sexual desire in pop music. A nearly 17-minute 12-inch single was released. The 12&quot; single became and remains a standard in discos today.

Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; peaking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at No.2 in 1976, is considered a feminist anthem and staple in the genre. Billboard recently ranked the song #1 on their list of &quot;The 34 Top Disco Songs of All Time.&quot; Summer is featured at all top six spots on the list.

In 1976 Donna Summer&#x27;s version of &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; brought disco further into the mainstream. In 1977 Summer, Moroder and Bellotte further released &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, as the B-side of &quot;Can&#x27;t We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)&quot;, which revolutionized dance music with its mostly electronic production and was a massive worldwide success, spawning the Hi-NRG subgenre. Giorgio Moroder was described by AllMusic as &quot;one of the principal architects of the disco sound&quot;. Another successful disco music project by Moroder at that time was Munich Machine (1976–1980).

Boney M. (1974–1986) was a West German Euro disco group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by record producer Frank Farian. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; (1976) &quot;Ma Baker&quot; (1977) and &quot;Rivers Of Babylon&quot; (1978). Another successful West German Euro disco recording act was Silver Convention (1974–1979). The German group Kraftwerk also had an influence on Euro disco.
In France, Dalida released &quot;J&#x27;attendrai&quot; (&quot;I Will Wait&quot;) in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe, and Japan. Dalida successfully adjusted herself to disco and released at least a dozen of songs that charted in the top 10 in Europe. Claude François, who re-invented himself as the &quot;king of French disco&quot;, released &quot;La plus belle chose du monde&quot;, a French version of the Bee Gees song &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, which became successful in Canada and Europe and &quot;Alexandrie Alexandra&quot; was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. Cerrone&#x27;s early songs, &quot;Love in C Minor&quot; (1976), &quot;Supernature&quot; (1977), and &quot;Give Me Love&quot; (1978) were successful in the US and Europe. Another Euro disco act was the French diva Amanda Lear, where Euro disco sound is most heard in &quot;Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)&quot; (1978). French producer Alec Costandinos assembled the Euro disco group Love and Kisses (1977–1982).

In Italy Raffaella Carrà was the most successful Euro disco act, alongside La Bionda, Hermanas Goggi and Oliver Onions. Her greatest international single was &quot;Tanti Auguri&quot; (&quot;Best Wishes&quot;), which has become a popular song with gay audiences. The song is also known under its Spanish title &quot;Para hacer bien el amor hay que venir al sur&quot; (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song &quot;Jätke võtmed väljapoole&quot; was performed by Anne Veski. &quot;A far l&#x27;amore comincia tu&quot; (&quot;To make love, your move first&quot;) was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as &quot;En el amor todo es empezar&quot;, in German as &quot;Liebelei&quot;, in French as &quot;Puisque tu l&#x27;aimes dis le lui&quot;, and in English as &quot;Do It, Do It Again&quot;. It was her only entry to the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 9, where she remains a one-hit wonder. In 1977, she recorded another successful single, &quot;Fiesta&quot; (&quot;The Party&quot; in English) originally in Spanish, but then recorded it in French and Italian after the song hit the charts. &quot;A far l&#x27;amore comincia tu&quot; has also been covered in Turkish by a Turkish popstar Ajda Pekkan as &quot;Sakın Ha&quot; in 1977.

Recently, Carrà has gained new attention for her appearance as the female dancing soloist in a 1974 TV performance of the experimental gibberish song &quot;Prisencolinensinainciusol&quot; (1973) by Adriano Celentano. A remixed video featuring her dancing went viral on the internet in 2008. In 2008 a video of a performance of her only successful UK single, &quot;Do It, Do It Again&quot;, was featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Midnight&quot;. Rafaella Carrà worked with Bob Sinclar on the new single &quot;Far l&#x27;Amore&quot; which was released on YouTube on March 17, 2011. The song charted in different European countries. Also prominent European disco acts are Spargo (band), Time Bandits (band) and Luv&#x27; from the Netherlands.

Euro disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene, even when disco&#x27;s popularity sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major U.S. record labels and producers. Through the influence of Italo disco, it also played a role in the evolution of early house music in the early 1980s and later forms of electronic dance music, including early &#x27;90s Eurodance.

===1977–1979: Pop preeminence===

==== &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (John Badham, 1977) ====
In December 1977, the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was released. It was a huge success and its soundtrack became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The idea for the film was sparked by a 1976 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article titled &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot; which supposedly chronicled the disco culture in mid-1970s New York City, but was later revealed to have been fabricated. Some critics said the film &quot;mainstreamed&quot; disco, making it more acceptable to heterosexual white males. Many music historians believe the success of the movie and soundtrack extended the life of the disco era by several years.

Organized around the culture of suburban discotheques and the character of Tony Manero, portrayed by John Travolta, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; became a cultural phenomenon that recast the dance floor as a site for patriarchal masculinity and heterosexual courtship. This transformation aligned disco with the interests of the perceived mass market, specifically targeting suburban and Middle American audiences.

The portrayal of the dance floor in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; marked a reappropriation by straight male culture, turning it into a space for men to showcase their prowess and pursue partners of the opposite sex. The film popularized the hustle, a Latin social dance, reinforcing the centrality of the straight-dancing couple in the disco exchange. Notably, the soundtrack, dominated by the Bee Gees, risked presenting disco as a new incarnation of shrill white pop, deviating from its diverse and inclusive origins. The success of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was unprecedented, breaking box office and album sale records. Unfortunately, its impact went beyond mere popularity. The film established a template for disco that was easily reproducible, yet thoroughly de-queered in its outlook. By narrowing the narrative to fit into the conventional ideals of suburban heterosexual culture, the film contributed to a distorted and commodified version of disco.

==== Disco goes mainstream ====
The Bee Gees used Barry Gibb&#x27;s falsetto to garner hits such as &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;More Than A Woman&quot;, &quot;Love You Inside Out&quot;, and &quot;Tragedy&quot;. Andy Gibb, a younger brother to the Bee Gees, followed with similarly styled solo singles such as &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot;, &quot;(Love Is) Thicker Than Water&quot;, and &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;.

In 1978, Donna Summer&#x27;s multi-million-selling vinyl single disco version of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for three weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The recording, which was included as part of the &quot;MacArthur Park Suite&quot; on her double live album &quot;Live and More&quot;, was eight minutes and 40 seconds long on the album. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version of MacArthur Park was Summer&#x27;s first single to reach number one on the Hot 100; it does not include the balladic second movement of the song, however. A 2013 remix of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; by Summer topped the Billboard Dance Charts marking five consecutive decades with a number-one song on the charts. From mid-1978 to late 1979, Summer continued to release singles such as &quot;Last Dance&quot;, &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; (with Brooklyn Dreams), &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; and &quot;On the Radio&quot;, all very successful songs, landing in the top five or better, on the Billboard pop charts.

The band Chic was formed mainly by guitarist Nile Rodgers—a self-described &quot;street hippie&quot; from late 1960s New York—and bassist Bernard Edwards. Their popular 1978 single, &quot;Le Freak&quot;, is regarded as an iconic song of the genre. Other successful songs by Chic include the often-sampled &quot;Good Times&quot; (1979), &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; (1979), and &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; (1979). The group regarded themselves as the disco movement&#x27;s rock band that made good on the hippie movement&#x27;s ideals of peace, love, and freedom. Every song they wrote was written with an eye toward giving it &quot;deep hidden meaning&quot; or D.H.M.

Sylvester, a flamboyant and openly gay singer famous for his soaring falsetto voice, scored his biggest disco hit in late 1978 with &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot;. His singing style was said to have influenced the singer Prince. At that time, disco was one of the forms of music most open to gay performers.

The Village People were a singing/dancing group created by Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo to target disco&#x27;s gay audience. They were known for their onstage costumes of typically male-associated jobs and ethnic minorities and achieved mainstream success with their 1978 hit song &quot;Macho Man&quot;. Other songs include &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; (1979) and &quot;In the Navy&quot; (1979).

Also noteworthy are The Trammps&#x27; &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; (1976), (1978, reissue due to the popularity gained from the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack), Heatwave&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1977), Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King&#x27;s &quot;Shame&quot; (1977), A Taste of Honey&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Oogie Oogie&quot; (1978), Cheryl Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Got to Be Real&quot; (1978), Alicia Bridges&#x27;s &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; (1978), Patrick Hernandez&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Alive&quot; (1978), Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s &quot;September&quot; (1978) and &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; (1979), Peaches &amp; Herb&#x27;s &quot;Shake Your Groove Thing&quot; (1978), Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s the Greatest Dancer&quot; (both 1979), McFadden and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; (1979), Anita Ward&#x27;s &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; (1979), Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; (1979) and &quot;Celebration&quot; (1980), The Whispers&#x27;s &quot;And the Beat Goes On&quot; (1979), Stephanie Mills&#x27;s &quot;What Cha Gonna Do with My Lovin&#x27;&quot; (1979), Lipps Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Funkytown&quot; (1980), The Brothers Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Stomp!&quot; (1980), George Benson&#x27;s &quot;Give Me the Night&quot; (1980), Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Sunset People&quot; (1980), and Walter Murphy&#x27;s various attempts to bring classical music to the mainstream, most notably the disco song &quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot; (1976), which was inspired by Beethoven&#x27;s fifth symphony.

At the height of its popularity, many non-disco artists recorded songs with disco elements, such as Rod Stewart with his &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; in 1979. Even mainstream rock artists adopted elements of disco. Progressive rock group Pink Floyd used disco-like drums and guitar in their song &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot; (1979), which became their only number-one single in both the US and UK. The Eagles referenced disco with &quot;One of These Nights&quot; (1975) and &quot;Disco Strangler&quot; (1979), Paul McCartney &amp; Wings with &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; (1976) and &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; (1979), Queen with &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; (1980), the Rolling Stones with &quot;Miss You&quot; (1978) and &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; (1980), Stephen Stills with his album &quot;Thoroughfare Gap&quot; (1978), Electric Light Orchestra with &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot; and &quot;Last Train to London&quot; (both 1979), Chicago with &quot;Street Player&quot; (1979), the Kinks with &quot;(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman&quot; (1979), the Grateful Dead with &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;, The Who with &quot;Eminence Front&quot; (1982), and the J. Geils Band with &quot;Come Back&quot; (1980). Even hard rock group KISS jumped in with &quot;I Was Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; (1979), and Ringo Starr&#x27;s album &quot;Ringo the 4th&quot; (1978) features a strong disco influence.

The disco sound was also adopted by artists from other genres, including the 1979 U.S. number one hit &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; by easy listening singer Barbra Streisand in a duet with Donna Summer. In country music, in an attempt to appeal to the more mainstream market, artists began to add pop/disco influences to their music. Dolly Parton launched a successful crossover onto the pop/dance charts, with her albums &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; containing songs with a disco flair. In particular, a disco remix of the track &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Burnin&#x27;&quot; peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart; ultimately becoming one of the year&#x27;s biggest club hits.
Additionally, Connie Smith covered Andy Gibb&#x27;s &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot; in 1977, Bill Anderson recorded &quot;Double S&quot; in 1978, and Ronnie Milsap released &quot;Get It Up&quot; and covered blues singer Tommy Tucker&#x27;s song &quot;Hi-Heel Sneakers&quot; in 1979.

Pre-existing non-disco songs, standards, and TV themes were frequently &quot;disco-ized&quot; in the 1970s, such as the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; theme (recorded as &quot;Disco Lucy&quot; by the Wilton Place Street Band), &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; (recorded as &quot;Brazil&quot; by The Ritchie Family), and &quot;Baby Face&quot; (recorded by the Wing and a Prayer Fife and Drum Corps). The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the big band era—which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big band arrangements, including Perry Como, who re-recorded his 1945 song &quot;Temptation&quot;, in 1975, as well as Ethel Merman, who released an album of disco songs entitled &quot;The Ethel Merman Disco Album&quot; in 1979.

Myron Floren, second-in-command on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, released a recording of the &quot;Clarinet Polka&quot; entitled &quot;Disco Accordion.&quot; Similarly, Bobby Vinton adapted &quot;The Pennsylvania Polka&quot; into a song named &quot;Disco Polka&quot;. Easy listening icon Percy Faith, in one of his last recordings, released an album entitled &quot;Disco Party&quot; (1975) and recorded a disco version of his &quot;Theme from &quot;A Summer Place&quot;&quot; in 1976. Even classical music was adapted for disco, notably Walter Murphy&#x27;s &quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot; (1976, based on the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony) and &quot;Flight 76&quot; (1976, based on Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;), and Louis Clark&#x27;s &quot;Hooked On Classics&quot; series of albums and singles.
Many original television theme songs of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (1975), &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (1975), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976), &quot;NBC Saturday Night At The Movies&quot; (1976), &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977), &quot;The Donahue Show&quot; (1977), &quot;CHiPs&quot; (1977), &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1977), &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978), NBC Sports broadcasts (1978), &quot;Kojak&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; (1979).

Disco jingles also made their way into many TV commercials, including Purina&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Good Mews&quot; cat food commercial and an &quot;IC Light&quot; commercial by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Iron City Brewing Company.

====Parodies====
Several parodies of the disco style were created. Rick Dees, at the time a radio DJ in Memphis, Tennessee, recorded &quot;Disco Duck&quot; (1976) and &quot;Dis-Gorilla&quot; (1977); Frank Zappa parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in &quot;Disco Boy&quot; on his 1976 &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; album and in &quot;Dancin&#x27; Fool&quot; on his 1979 &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; album. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s eponymous 1983 debut album includes a disco song called &quot;Gotta Boogie&quot;, an extended pun on the similarity of the disco move to the American slang word &quot;booger&quot;. Comedian Bill Cosby devoted his entire 1977 album &quot;Disco Bill&quot; to disco parodies. In 1980, &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; released a flexi-disc titled &quot;Mad Disco&quot; featuring six full-length parodies of the genre. Rock and roll songs critical of disco included Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot; and, especially, the Who&#x27;s &quot;Sister Disco&quot; (both 1978)—although the Who&#x27;s &quot;Eminence Front&quot; (four years later) had a disco feel.

===1979–1981: Controversy and decline in popularity===

By the end of the 1970s, anti-disco sentiment developed among rock music fans and musicians, particularly in the United States. Disco was criticized as mindless, consumerist, overproduced and escapist. The slogans &quot;Disco sucks&quot; and &quot;Death to disco&quot; became common. Rock artists such as Rod Stewart and David Bowie who added disco elements to their music were accused of selling out.

The punk subculture in the United States and the United Kingdom was often hostile to disco, although, in the UK, many early Sex Pistols fans such as the Bromley Contingent and Jordan liked disco, often congregating at nightclubs such as Louise&#x27;s in Soho and the Sombrero in Kensington. The track &quot;Love Hangover&quot; by Diana Ross, the house anthem at the former, was cited as a particular favourite by many early UK punks.
The film &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; and its soundtrack album contained a disco medley of Sex Pistols songs, entitled &quot;Black Arabs&quot; and credited to a group of the same name.

However, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, in the song &quot;Saturday Night Holocaust&quot;, likened disco to the cabaret culture of Weimar-era Germany for its apathy towards government policies and its escapism. Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo said that disco was &quot;like a beautiful woman with a great body and no brains&quot;, and a product of political apathy of that era. New Jersey rock critic Jim Testa wrote &quot;Put a Bullet Through the Jukebox&quot;, a vitriolic screed attacking disco that was considered a punk call to arms. Steve Hillage, shortly prior to his transformation from a progressive rock musician into an electronic artist at the end of the 1970s with the inspiration of disco, disappointed his rockist fans by admitting his love for disco, with Hillage recalling &quot;it&#x27;s like I&#x27;d killed their pet cat.&quot;

Anti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; was a hostile attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the 1980 comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, a wayward airplane slices a radio tower with its wing, knocking out an all-disco radio station. July 12, 1979, became known as &quot;the day disco died&quot; because of the Disco Demolition Night, an anti-disco demonstration in a baseball double-header at Comiskey Park in Chicago. Rock station DJs Steve Dahl and Garry Meier, along with Michael Veeck, son of Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader which involved exploding disco records in centerfield. As the second game was about to begin, the raucous crowd stormed onto the field and proceeded to set fires and tear out seats and pieces of turf. The Chicago Police Department made numerous arrests, and the extensive damage to the field forced the White Sox to forfeit the second game to the Detroit Tigers, who had won the first game.

Disco&#x27;s decline in popularity after Disco Demolition Night was rapid. On July 12, 1979, the top six records on the U.S. music charts were disco songs. By September 22, there were no disco songs in the US Top 10 chart, with the exception of Herb Alpert&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Rise&quot;, a smooth jazz composition with some disco overtones. Some in the media, in celebratory tones, declared disco dead and rock revived. Karen Mixon Cook, the first female disco DJ, stated that people still pause every July 12 for a moment of silence in honor of disco. Dahl stated in a 2004 interview that disco was &quot;probably on its way out [at the time]. But I think it [Disco Demolition Night] hastened its demise&quot;.

====Impact on the music industry====
The anti-disco movement, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, country music began a slow rise on the pop chart. Emblematic of country music&#x27;s rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. The continued popularity of power pop and the revival of oldies in the late 1970s was also related to disco&#x27;s decline; the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot; was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was John Travolta, who in 1977 had starred in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.

During this period of decline in disco&#x27;s popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, MCA Records purchased ABC Records, absorbed some of its artists and then shut the label down. Midsong International Records ceased operations in 1980. RSO Records founder Robert Stigwood left the label in 1981 and TK Records closed in the same year. Salsoul Records continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand. Casablanca Records had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company PolyGram.

Many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even ones who tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The Bee Gees, for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989&#x27;s &quot;One&quot;) and three more top-40 songs, even though numerous songs they wrote and had other artists perform were successful, and the band itself had largely abandoned disco in its 1980s and 1990s songs. Chic never hit the top-40 again after &quot;Good Times&quot; topped the chart in August 1979. Of the handful of groups not taken down by disco&#x27;s fall from favor, Kool and the Gang, Donna Summer, the Jacksons, and Gloria Gaynor in particular, stand out. In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on, they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. Earth, Wind &amp; Fire also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&amp;B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s. Some popular disco tracks released after Disco Demolition Night include &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; by Kool and the Gang (1981), &quot;In the Middle&quot; by Unlimited Touch (1981), &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; by Diana Ross (1980), &quot;My Feet Keep Dancing&quot; by Chic (1980), &quot;Funky Town&quot; by Lipps Inc. (1979), &quot;Lady (You Bring Me Up)&quot; by The Commodores (1981) and &quot;All American Girls&quot; by Sister Sledge (1981).

Six months prior to Disco Demolition Night (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI (WLS-FM) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that competed against WDAI at the time, WGCI-FM, would later incorporate R&amp;B and pop songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the Chicago house genre to the airwaves.

====Factors contributing to disco&#x27;s decline====
Factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants. In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the &quot;Disco sucks&quot; movement as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures. It was also linked to a wider cultural &quot;backlash&quot;, the move towards conservatism, that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president Ronald Reagan in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the United States Senate for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the Religious Right around the same time.

In January 1979, rock critic Robert Christgau argued that homophobia, and most likely racism, were reasons behind the movement, a conclusion seconded by John Rockwell. Craig Werner wrote: &quot;The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives, and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. Nonetheless, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia.&quot; Legs McNeil, founder of the fanzine &quot;Punk&quot;, was quoted in an interview as saying, &quot;the hippies always wanted to be black. We were going, &#x27;fuck the blues, fuck the black experience.&#x27;&quot; He also said that disco was the result of an &quot;unholy&quot; union between homosexuals and blacks.

Steve Dahl, who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it. But we weren&#x27;t thinking like that,&quot; it was &quot;just kids pissing on a musical genre&quot;. It has been noted that British punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist reggae genre as well as the more pro-gay new romantics movement. Christgau and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.

In 1979, the music industry in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed. The producer-oriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industry&#x27;s artist-oriented marketing system. Harold Childs, senior vice president at A&amp;M Records, reportedly told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;radio is really desperate for rock product&quot; and &quot;they&#x27;re all looking for some white rock-n-roll&quot;. Gloria Gaynor argued that the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight.

===1981–1989: Aftermath===
====Birth of electronic dance music====
Disco was instrumental in the development of electronic dance music genres like house, techno, and Eurodance. The Eurodisco song &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, produced by Giorgio Moroder for Donna Summer in 1976, has been described as a milestone and blueprint for electronic dance music because it was the first to combine repetitive synthesizer loops with a continuous four-on-the-floor bass drum and an off-beat hi-hat, which would become a main feature of techno and house ten years later.

During the first years of the 1980s, the traditional disco sound characterized by complex arrangements performed by large ensembles of studio session musicians (including a horn section and an orchestral string section) began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward electronic and pop genres, starting with hi-NRG. Despite its decline in popularity, so-called club music and European-style disco remained relatively successful in the early-to-mid 1980s with songs like Aneka&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Boy&quot;, The Weather Girls&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, Stacey Q&#x27;s &quot;Two of Hearts&quot;, Dead or Alive&#x27;s &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;, Laura Branigan&#x27;s &quot;Self Control&quot;, and Baltimora&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;. However, a revival of the traditional-style disco called nu-disco has been popular since the 1990s.

House music displayed a strong disco influence, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping electronic dance music and contemporary club culture, is often described being &quot;disco&#x27;s revenge.&quot; Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive four-on-the-floor beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound.

===DJ culture===

The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and DJ mixers to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting DJ mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. It, in turn, affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching and scratching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.
In the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at Paradise Garage, Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and Francis Grasso became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a cult following among clubgoers, who referred to his DJ sets as &quot;Saturday Mass&quot;. Some DJs would use reel-to-reel tape recorders to make remixes and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat-matched records, the first to use electronic effects units in his mixes, and he was an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of WKTU and WBLS. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ &quot;profession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef.&quot; Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use their own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining their personal sound and aesthetic, and building their own reputation.

===Post-disco===

The post-disco sound and genres associated with it originated in the 1970s and early 1980s with R&amp;B and post-punk musicians focusing on a more electronic and experimental side of disco, spawning boogie, Italo disco, and alternative dance. Drawing from a diverse range of non-disco influences and techniques, such as the &quot;one-man band&quot; style of Kashif and Stevie Wonder and alternative approaches of Parliament-Funkadelic, it was driven by synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines. Post-disco acts include D. Train, Patrice Rushen, ESG, Bill Laswell, Arthur Russell. Post-disco had an important influence on dance-pop and was bridging classical disco and later forms of electronic dance music.

===Early hip hop===

The disco sound had a strong influence on early hip hop. Most of the early hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. The Sugarhill Gang used Chic&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot; as the foundation for their 1979 song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.

With synthesizers and Krautrock influences that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when Afrika Bambaataa released the single &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, spawning a hip hop electronic dance trend that includes songs such as Planet Patrol&#x27;s &quot;Play at Your Own Risk&quot; (1982), C-Bank&#x27;s &quot;One More Shot&quot; (1982), Cerrone&#x27;s &quot;Club Underworld&quot; (1984), Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (1983), Freeez&#x27;s &quot;I.O.U.&quot; (1983), Midnight Star&#x27;s &quot;Freak-a-Zoid&quot; (1983), and Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;I Feel For You&quot; (1984).

===House music and rave culture===

House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s (also see: Chicago house). It quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, where it developed into the harder and more industrial techno, New York City (also see: garage house), and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America and Australia. Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot; by MARRS (1987), &quot;House Nation&quot; by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), &quot;Theme from S&#x27;Express&quot; by S&#x27;Express (1988) and &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the House&quot; by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.

House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more aggressive acid house or the minimalist microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house, and jump house.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, rave culture began to emerge from the house and acid house scene. Like house, it incorporated disco culture&#x27;s same love of dance music played by DJs over powerful sound systems, recreational drug and club drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for mass consumption. In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed (mostly) underground. In part, this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid law enforcement attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like ecstasy.

===Post-punk ===
The post-punk movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported punk rock&#x27;s rule-breaking while rejecting its move back to raw rock music. Post-punk&#x27;s mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles. Public Image Limited is considered the first post-punk group. The group&#x27;s second album &quot;Metal Box&quot; fully embraced the &quot;studio as instrument&quot; methodology of disco. The group&#x27;s founder John Lydon, the former lead singer for the Sex Pistols, told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.

No wave was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City. For shock value, James Chance, a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the &quot;East Village Eye&quot; urging his readers to move uptown and get &quot;trancin&#x27; with some superradioactive disco voodoo funk&quot;. His band James White and the Blacks wrote a disco album titled &quot;Off White&quot;. Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on). In 1981 ZE Records led the transition from no wave into the more subtle mutant disco (post-disco/punk) genre. Mutant disco acts such as Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Was Not Was, ESG and Liquid Liquid influenced several British post-punk acts such as New Order, Orange Juice and A Certain Ratio.

===Nu-disco===
Nu-disco is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco aesthetics. The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport. These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro, and other genres popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also used to describe the music on several American labels who were previously associated with the genres electroclash and French house.

==Revivals and return to mainstream success==
===1990s resurgence===

In the 1990s, after a decade of backlash, disco and its legacy became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs, films, and compilations were released that referenced disco. This was part of a wave of 1970s nostalgia that was taking place in popular culture at the time. Some commentators attributed the revival of the genre to frequent use of disco music in fashion shows.

Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included Deee-Lite&#x27;s &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot; (1990), U2&#x27;s &quot;Lemon&quot; (1993), Blur&#x27;s &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; (1994) and &quot;Entertain Me&quot; (1995), Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Disco 2000&quot; (1995), and Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Canned Heat&quot; (1999), while films such as &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.

===2000s resurgence===
In the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called &quot;nu-disco&quot; began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;One More Time&quot; and Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with funky house, such as Spiller&#x27;s &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; and Modjo&#x27;s &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight)&quot;, both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2000. Robbie Williams&#x27;s disco single &quot;Rock DJ&quot; was the UK&#x27;s fourth best-selling single the same year. Jamiroquai&#x27;s song &quot;Little L&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; by Sophie Ellis-Bextor were hits in 2001. Rock band Manic Street Preachers released a disco song, &quot;Miss Europa Disco Dancer&quot;, in the same year. The song&#x27;s disco influence, which appears on &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;, was described as being &quot;much-discussed&quot;. In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s and released her album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; to rave reviews. One of the singles from the album, &quot;Hung Up&quot;, which samples ABBA&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;, became a major club staple. In addition to Madonna&#x27;s disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her Confessions Tour incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the roller derby. In 2006, Jessica Simpson released her album &quot;A Public Affair&quot; inspired by disco and the 1980s music. The first single of the album, &quot;&quot;&quot;A Public Affair&quot;, was reviewed as a disco-dancing competition influenced by Madonna&#x27;s early works. The video of the song was filmed on a skating rink and features a line dance of hands.

The success of the &quot;nu-disco&quot; revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: &quot;The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It&#x27;s a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. Madison Avenue look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. &#x27;Groovejet&#x27; accepts the night&#x27;s changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused smile and a few great one-liners.&quot;

===2010s resurgence===
In 2011, K-pop girl group T-ara released Roly-Poly as a part of their EP &quot;John Travolta Wannabe&quot;. The song accumulated over 4,000,000 units in digital downloads, which became the highest number of downloads for a K-pop girl group single on the Gaon Digital Chart in the 2010s. In 2013, with several 1970s-style disco and funk being released, the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s. The biggest disco song of the year was &quot;Get Lucky&quot; by Daft Punk, featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar. Its parent album, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, ended up winning Album of the Year at the 2014 Grammys. Other disco-styled songs that made it into the top 40 that year were Robin Thicke&#x27;s &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; (number one), Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Take Back the Night&quot; (number 29), Bruno Mars&#x27; &quot;Treasure&quot; (number five) Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Reflektor&quot; featured strong disco elements. In 2014, disco music could be found in Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Artpop&quot; and Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Birthday&quot;. Other disco songs from 2014 include &quot;I Want It All&quot; By Karmin, &#x27;Wrong Club&quot; by the Ting Tings, &quot;Blow&quot; by Beyoncé and the William Orbit mix of &quot;Let Me in Your Heart Again&quot; by Queen.

In 2014 Brazilian Globo TV, the second biggest television network in the world, aired Boogie Oogie, a telenovela about the Disco Era that takes place between 1978 and 1979, from the hit fever to the decadence. The show&#x27;s success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to the stage and to Brazilian record charts local disco divas like Lady Zu and As Frenéticas.

Top-10 entries from 2015 such as Mark Ronson&#x27;s disco groove-infused &quot;Uptown Funk&quot;, Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Sugar&quot;, the Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Feel My Face&quot; and Jason Derulo&#x27;s &quot;Want To Want Me&quot; also have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared in 2015 with his new album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, which proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It, I Love It&quot; by Flo Rida, &quot;Adventure of a Lifetime&quot; by Coldplay, &quot;Back Together&quot; by Robin Thicke and &quot;Levels&quot; by Nick Jonas feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs continued showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that had been dominating the charts up until then. Justin Timberlake&#x27;s 2016 song &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Feeling!&quot;, which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the history of the chart. &quot;The Martian&quot;, a 2015 film, extensively uses disco music as a soundtrack, although for the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, there&#x27;s only one thing worse than being stranded on Mars: it&#x27;s being stranded on Mars with nothing but disco music. &quot;Kill the Lights&quot;, featured on an episode of the HBO television series &quot;Vinyl&quot; (2016) and with Nile Rodgers&#x27; guitar licks, hit number one on the US Dance chart in July 2016.

===2020s resurgence===
In 2020, disco continued its mainstream popularity and became a prominent trend in popular music. In early 2020, disco-influenced hits such as Doja Cat&#x27;s &quot;Say So&quot;, Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Stupid Love&quot;, and Dua Lipa&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Now&quot; experienced widespread success on global music charts, charting at numbers 1, 5 and 2, respectively, on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. At the time, &quot;Billboard&quot;, declared that Lipa was &quot;leading the charge toward disco-influenced production&quot; a day after her retro and disco-influenced album &quot;Future Nostalgia&quot; was released on March 27, 2020. By the end of 2020, multiple disco albums had been released, including Adam Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Velvet&quot;, Jessie Ware&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Your Pleasure?&quot;, and Róisín Murphy&#x27;s discothèque mixtape, &quot;Róisín Machine&quot;. In early September 2020, South Korean group BTS debuted at number 1 in the US with their English–language disco single &quot;Dynamite&quot; having sold 265,000 downloads in its first week in the US, marking the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; (2017).

In July 2020, Australian singer Kylie Minogue announced she would be releasing her fifteenth studio album, &quot;Disco&quot;, on November 6, 2020. The album was preceded by two singles. The lead single, &quot;Say Something&quot;, was released on July 23 and premiered on BBC Radio 2; the second single, &quot;Magic&quot;, was released on September 24. Both singles received critical acclaim, with critics praising Minogue for returning to disco roots, which were prominent in her albums &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000), &quot;Fever&quot; (2001), and &quot;Aphrodite&quot; (2010).

<text>The Donegal fiddle tradition is one of the distinct fiddle traditions within Irish traditional music. The distinctness of the Donegal tradition developed due to the close relations between County Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, in addition to the ”universally known” standard Irish dance tunes, there is an added volume of Scottish and Nova Scotia tunes played, with even some tunes from Shetland and Orkney. This includes standard tune types such as double jigs (), slip jigs (), reels (), and hornpipes (swung ). It has been claimed that Donegal musicians play more slip jigs than any other region of Ireland. This is potentially due to the geographical borders/mountains (as well as national borders with Northern Ireland) keeping Donegal&#x27;s repertoire more locally-known for decades. There is also a prevalence of mazurka playing. Mazurkas are historically mainland-European tunes very similar to a waltz, in its meter, though generally livelier and with more emphasis being placed on the second beat of each measure. Another uniquely Donegal tune is called the barndance, stemming from the Germanic schottische (essentially meaning ‘Scottish’), also similar to the Norwegian reinlander. The barndance is very similar to a hornpipe, but slower than a reel; typically they are played with less of a hornpipe&#x27;s “swing” and more of the “drive” of a reel.

In stark contrast to other Irish musical styles, the Donegal tradition also has the Scottish strathspey, a traditional dance from Scotland, played a bit like a hornpipe but with emphasis on the semi-quaver; this dotted rhythm gives the strathspey its distinct “Scotch Snap” sound. While strathspeys are definitely known in Donegal (albeit played slightly slower and with less ”snap” than Scottish fiddlers), more common is the highland. Very rarely referred to as a “highland fling”, these quintessentially Donegal tunes are influenced by the Scottish strathspey, but played a bit smoother, as a sort of “strathspey-reel”. Some Scotch Snaps will be played, but highlands tend to be more akin to a slower reel, overall. Reels, themselves, are said to have originated in Scottish music. The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict, between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition, when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.

The tradition has several distinguishing traits compared to other fiddle traditions such as the Sliabh Luachra style of southern Ireland, most of which involves styles of bowing and the ornamentation of the music, and rhythm. Due to the frequency of double stops and the strong bowing it is often compared to the Cape Breton tradition. Another characteristic of the style is the rapid pace at which it tends to proceed. Modern players, such as the fiddle group Altan, continue to be popular due to a variety of reasons.

Among the most famous Donegal style players are John Doherty from the early twentieth century and James Byrne, Paddy Glackin, Tommy Peoples and Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh in recent decades.

==History==

The fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the Book of Leinster (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. However the first mention of the fiddle being in use in Donegal is from the blind harper Arthur O&#x27;Neill who in his 1760 memoirs described a wedding in Ardara as having &quot;plenty of pipers and fiddlers&quot;. Donegal fiddlers participated in the development of the Irish music tradition in the 18th century during which jigs and slipjigs and later reels and hornpipes became the dominant musical forms. However, Donegal musicians, many of them being fishermen, also frequently travelled to Scotland, where they acquired tune types from the Scottish repertoire such as the Strathspey which was integrated into the Donegal tradition as &quot;Highland&quot; tunes. The Donegal tradition derives much of its unique character from the synthesis of Irish and Scottish stylistic features and repertoires. Aoidh notes however that while different types of art music were commonly played among the upper classes of Scottish society in the 18th century, the Donegal tradition drew exclusively from the popular types of Scottish music. Like some Scottish fiddlers (who, like Donegal fiddlers, tend to use a short bow and play in a straight-ahead fashion), some Donegal fiddlers worked at imitating the sound of the bagpipes. Workers from Donegal would bring their music to Scotland and also bring back Scottish tunes with them such music of J. Scott Skinner and Mackenzie Murdoch. Lilting, unaccompanied singing of wordless tunes, was also an important part of the Donegal musical tradition often performed by women in social settings. Describing the musical life of Arranmore Island in the late 19th century singer Róise Rua Nic Gríanna describes the most popular dances: &quot;The Sets, the Lancers, the Maggie Pickie [i.e., Maggie Pickins] the Donkey, the Mazurka and the Barn dances&quot;. Among the travelling fiddlers of the late 19th century players such as John Mhosaí McGinley, Anthony Hilferty, the McConnells and the Dohertys are best known. As skill levels increased through apprenticeships several fiddle masters appeared such as the Cassidy&#x27;s, Connie Haughey, Jimmy Lyons and Miock McShane of Teelin and Francie Dearg and Mickey Bán Byrne of Kilcar. These virtuosos played unaccompanied listening pieces in addition to the more common dance music.

The influences between Scotland and Donegal went both ways and were furthered by a wave of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as can be heard in the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal&#x27;s own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.

As Irish music was consolidated and organised under the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann movement in the 1960s, both strengthened the interest in traditional music but sometimes conflicted with the Donegal tradition and its social conventions. The rigidly organised sessions of the Comhaltas reflected the traditions of Southern Ireland and Donegal fiddlers like John Doherty considered the National repertoire with its strong focus on reels to be less diverse than that of Donegal with its varied rhythms. Other old fiddlers dislike the ways comhaltas sessions were organised with a committee player, often not himself a musician, in charge. Sometimes Comhaltas representatives would even disparage the Donegal tradition, with its Scottish flavour, as being un-Irish, and prohibit them from playing local tunes with Scottish genealogies such as the &quot;Highlands&quot; at Comhaltas sessions. This sometimes cause antagonism between Donegal players and the main organisation of traditional music in Ireland.

Outside of the Comhaltas movement however, Donegal fiddling stood strong with Paddy Glackin of Ceoltorí Laighean and the Bothy Band and later Tommy Peoples also with the Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with Altan, who all drew attention and prestige to the Donegal tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.

==Description of style==

The Donegal style of fiddling is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county. To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterised by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-swung in the playing of the fast dance tune types (reel and jigs); short (non-slurred), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed triplets more often than trills as ornaments, the use of double stops and droning; and the occurrence of &quot;playing the octave&quot;, with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics are universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all. In general, however, the style is rather aggressive.

Another feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played. Highlands, a type of tune in time with some similarities to Scottish strathspeys, which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county. Other tune types common solely in the county include barndances, also called &quot;Germans,&quot; and mazurkas.

==Fiddlers of the Donegal tradition==
===Historical===
There are a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal. Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family. Hugh Doherty is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, John Doherty. John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded. John&#x27;s older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John&#x27;s.

There is no single Donegal style but several distinctive styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of Donegal including Inishowen, eastern Donegal, The Rosses and Gweedore, Croaghs, Teelin, Kilcar, Glencolmcille, Ballyshannon and Bundoran. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Notable deceased players of the older Donegal styles include Neillidh (&quot;Neilly&quot;) Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy, Frank Cassidy, James Byrne (1946–2008), P.V. O&#x27;Donnell (2011), and Tommy Peoples (1948–2018). Currently living Donegal fiddlers, include, Vincent Campbell, John Gallagher, Paddy Glackin, and Danny O&#x27;Donnell.

===Modern===
Fiddle playing continues to be popular in Donegal. The three fiddlers of the Donegal &quot;supergroup&quot; Altan, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, Paul O&#x27;Shaughnessy, and Ciarán Tourish, are generally admired within Donegal. An example of another fiddler-player from Donegal is Liz Doherty.
Another well regarded fiddle player hailing from Donegal is Aidan O&#x27;Donnell. TG4 Young Musician of the Year 2010 Aidan O&#x27;Donnell has been described as one of the finest young Irish musicians at present. He began his music making at the age of 12, and since then has performed with some of traditional music&#x27;s finest artists, including Donal Lunny, Micheal Ó&#x27;Suilleabháin and the Chieftains. In 2007, he won the prestigious ‘Oireachtas na Geailge&#x27; fiddle title, and has been a regular tutor at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, at the University of Limerick for the past number of years.

The fiddle, and traditional music in general, remained popular in Donegal not only because of the international coverage of certain artists but because of local pride in the music. Traditional music &quot;Seisiúns&quot; are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.

<doc id="7975" wikidata="Q545385" url="?curid=7975" title="Double-barreled shotgun">
<text>A double-barreled shotgun, also known as a double shotgun, is a break-action shotgun with two parallel barrels, allowing two single shots that can be fired simultaneously or sequentially in quick succession.

==Construction==
Modern double-barreled shotguns, often known as &quot;doubles&quot;, are almost universally break action, with the barrels hinge down at the rear to expose the breech ends for unloading and reloading. Since there is no reciprocating action needed to eject and reload the shells, doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as pump action, lever action, bolt action, or self-loading shotguns.

===Barrel configuration===

Double-barreled shotguns (specifically break-action), come in two basic configurations:
* side-by-side (S×S) — the two barrels are arranged horizontally;
* over-and-under (O/U) — the two barrels are arranged vertically.

The original double-barreled guns were commonly all side-by-side designs, which was a more practical design for muzzleloaders. Early cartridge-firing shotguns also used the side-by-side action, because they kept the exposed hammers of the earlier muzzleloading shotguns from which they evolved. When hammerless designs started to become common, the over-and-under design was introduced, and most modern sporting doubles are over-and-under designs.

One significant advantage that doubles have over single-barrel repeating shotguns is the ability to have more than one choke at a time. Some shotgun shooting sports, such as skeet shooting, use crossing targets presented in a narrow range of distance, and only require one level of choke. Other sports, like sporting clays, give the shooter targets at differing ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the shooter, and so must be engaged at differing ranges. Having two barrels lets the shooter use a more open choke for near targets, and a tighter choke for distant targets, providing the optimal shot pattern for each distance.

The disadvantage lies in the fact that the barrels of a double-barreled shotgun, whether over-and-under or side-by-side, are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at &quot;40 yards out&quot;. For the side-by-side configuration, the shotstring continues on its path to the opposite side of the rib after the converging point; for example, the left barrel&#x27;s discharge travels on the left of the rib till it hits dead center at 40 yards (36.58 m) out, after that, the discharge continues on to the right. In the over-and-under configuration with a parallel rib, both barrels&#x27; discharges will keep to the dead center, but the discharge from the &quot;under&quot; barrel will shoot higher than the discharge from the &quot;over&quot; barrel after 40 yards (36.58 m). Thus, double-barreled shotguns are accurate only at practical shotgun ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that distance.

Side-by-side shotguns are often more expensive, and may take more practice to aim effectively than an over-and-under. The off-center nature of the recoil in a side-by-side gun may make shooting the body-side barrel slightly more painful by comparison to an over-and-under, single-shot, or pump-action, lever-action shotgun. Gas-operated and Recoil-operated, designs will recoil less than either. More side-by-side than over-and-under guns have traditional &quot;cast-off&quot; stocks, where the end of the buttstock veers slightly to the right, allowing a right-handed user to point the gun more easily.

Double-barreled shotguns are also inherently more safe, as whether the shotgun is loaded or can be fired can be ascertained by anyone present if the action is broken open, for instance on a skeet, trap or hunting clays course when another shooter is firing; if the action is open, the gun cannot fire. Similarly, doubles are more easily examined to see if loaded than pump-action or semi-automatic shotguns, whose bolt must be opened and chamber closely examined or felt to make sure it is unloaded; with a double gun (or a break-action single gun), whether the gun is loaded, i.e., has cartridges in any chamber, is easily and immediately seen with a glance (and just as easily unloaded).

===Trigger mechanism===
The early doubles used two triggers, one for each barrel, located front to back inside the trigger guard. The index finger was used to pull either trigger, as having two fingers inside the trigger guard can cause a very undesirable recoil-induced double-discharge. Double-trigger designs are typically set up for right-handed users. In double-trigger designs, it is often possible to pull both triggers at once, firing both barrels simultaneously, though this is generally not recommended as it doubles the recoil, battering both shotgun and shooter, particularly if it was unanticipated or unintended. Discharging both barrels at the same time has long been a hunting trick employed by hunters using 8 gauge &quot;elephant&quot; shotguns, firing the two slugs for sheer stopping power at close range.

Later models use a single trigger that alternately fires both barrels, called a &quot;single selective trigger&quot; or &quot;SST&quot;. The single selective trigger does not allow firing both barrels at once, since the single trigger must be pulled twice in order to fire both barrels. The change from one barrel to the other may be done by a clockwork type system, where a cam alternates between barrels, or by an inertial system where the recoil of firing the first barrel toggles the trigger to the next barrel. A double-barreled shotgun with an inertial trigger works best with full power shotshells; shooting low recoil shotshells often will not reliably toggle the inertial trigger, causing an apparent failure to fire occasionally when attempting to depress the trigger a second time to fire the second barrel (this also can happen if the first shell fails to fire). Generally there is a method of selecting the order in which the barrels of a single selective trigger shotgun fire; commonly this is done through manipulation of the safety, pushing to one side to select top barrel first and the other side to select bottom barrel first. In the event that an inertial trigger does not toggle to the second barrel when firing low recoil shotshells, manually selecting the order to the second barrel will enable the second barrel to fire when the trigger is depressed again.

One of the advantages of double-barreled shotgun with double triggers or single selective trigger, is that the second shot can be taken almost immediately after the first with merely a second trigger pull, without needing to manually operate the action (which will inevitably destabilize the gun from the shoulder position and affect aim), and can utilize different chokes for the two shots (assuming, of course, that full power shotshells are fired, at least for a double-barreled shotgun with an inertial type single selective trigger, as needed to toggle the inertial trigger). This can be noticeably faster than a pump-action shotgun, which requires manually pumping the fore-end to eject and reload for the second shot, and may be faster, or not slower, than a semi-automatic shotgun (as there are no bolt movements to delay the rechambering of a second shell). Note, however, in neither the pump-action or semi-automatic will the second shot be a different choke pattern from the first shot, whereas for a double, the two shots are usually with different chokes. Thus, depending on the nature of the hunt, the appropriate choke for the shot is always at hand. For example, while field hunting flushing birds, the first shot is usually closer than the second because the bird flies away from the shooter; so, the more open choke (and barrel) would be better for the first shot, and if a second shot is needed, as the bird is flying away, the more closed (and thus longer distance of an effective shot pattern) choke (and barrel) is then appropriate. Conversely, on a driven hunt, where the birds are driven towards the shooter, the closed (longer effective distance) choke (and barrel) should be fired first, saving the open (closer effective distance) choke (and barrel) for the now-closer incoming bird. None of this is possible with single-barrel shotguns, only with a double, either a side-by-side (S×S) or over-and-under (O/U).

===Regulation===
&quot;Regulation&quot; is a term used for multi-barreled firearms (most commonly found in rifles and shotguns) that indicates how close to the same point of aim the barrels will shoot. A poorly regulated gun may hit consistently with one barrel but miss consistently with the other, making the gun nearly useless for anything requiring two shots. However, the short ranges and spread of shot provide a significant overlap, so a small error in regulation in a double is often too small to be noticed. Generally, the shotguns are regulated to hit the point of aim at a given distance usually the maximum expected range since that is the range at which a full choke is used and where precise regulation matters most. The regulation is usually more important in side-by-side rather than in over-and-under shotguns, as felt recoil differs.

<text>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as cake, biscuit, ice cream and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts. In some parts of the world, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.

Historically, the dessert course consisted entirely of foods &quot;from the storeroom&quot; (&quot;de l’office&quot;), including fresh, stewed, preserved, and dried fruits; nuts; cheese and other dairy dishes; dry biscuits (cookies) and wafers; and ices and ice creams. Sweet dishes from the kitchen, such as freshly prepared pastries, meringues, custards, puddings, and baked fruits, were served in the entremets course, not in the dessert course. By the 20th century, though, sweet entremets had come to be included among the desserts. 

The modern term &quot;dessert&quot; can apply to many sweets, including fruit, custards, gelatins, puddings, biscuits, cookies, macaroons, pastries, pies, tarts, cakes, ice creams, and sweet soups.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;dessert&quot; originated from the French word &quot;desservir,&quot; meaning &quot;to clear the table&quot;, and it referred to the final course of the meal, presented after the table was &quot;cleared&quot; (&quot;deservi&quot;).

One of the earliest uses of the term in a culinary context is in the &quot;Ménagier de Paris&quot; (1393), which includes a course of &quot;desserte&quot; in three of the menus, one of which includes sweet pastries and fruits, another of which includes savory frumenty and venison.

In later centuries, the term continued to refer to the last course of the meal. In the late 19th century, the word &quot;desserts&quot; also came to refer to the dishes served in the dessert course.

==Other names==
The word &quot;dessert&quot; is most commonly used for this course in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States, while it is one of several synonyms, including &quot;&quot;pudding&quot;, &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;afters&quot;&quot;, in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries.

== History ==

Sweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia and ancient India and other ancient civilizations. Herodotus mentions that Persian meals featured many desserts, and were more varied in their sweet offerings than the main dishes. German army officer Helmuth von Moltke whilst serving in the Ottoman Empire noted the unusual presentation of courses with the sweet courses served between roasts and other savory dishes.

Dried fruit and honey were probably the first sweeteners used in most of the world, but the spread of sugarcane around the world was essential to the development of dessert. Sugarcane was grown and refined in India before 500 BC and was crystallized, making it easy to transport, by AD 500. Sugar and sugarcane were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 303 BC and China by AD 600. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and desserts for over a thousand years.

Sugarcane and sugar were little known and rare in Europe until the twelfth century or later when the Crusades and then colonization spread its use. Europeans began to manufacture sugar in the Middle Ages, and more sweet desserts became available. Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions. The first apple pie recipe was published in 1381; The earliest documentation of the term &quot;cupcake&quot; was in &quot;Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats&quot; in 1828 in Eliza Leslie&#x27;s &quot;Receipts&quot; cookbook.

The Industrial Revolution in Europe and later America led to the mass-production of foodstuffs, including desserts, that could be processed, preserved, canned, and packaged. Frozen foods, including desserts, became very popular starting in the 1920s.

== Ingredients ==
Sweet desserts usually contain cane sugar, palm sugar, brown sugar, honey, or some types of syrup such as molasses, maple syrup, treacle, or corn syrup. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are flour or other starches, cooking fats such as butter or lard, dairy, eggs, salt, acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, and spices and other flavoring agents such as chocolate, coffee, peanut butter, fruits, and nuts. The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.

Sugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts. The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts. Egg whites can act as a leavening agent or provide structure. Further innovation in the healthy eating movement has led to more information being available about vegan and gluten-free substitutes for the standard ingredients, as well as replacements for refined sugar.

Desserts can contain many spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors. Salt and acids are added to desserts to balance sweet flavors and create a contrast in flavors. Some desserts are coffee-flavored, for example an iced coffee soufflé or coffee biscuits. Alcohols and liqueurs can also be used as an ingredient, to make alcoholic desserts.

==Varieties and elements==

Desserts consist of variations of tastes, textures, and appearances. Desserts can be defined as a usually sweeter course that concludes a meal. This definition includes a range of courses ranging from fruits or dried nuts to multi-ingredient cakes and pies. Many cultures have different variations of dessert. In modern times the variations of desserts have usually been passed down or come from geographical regions. This is one cause for the variation of desserts. These are some major categories in which desserts can be placed.

===Cakes===
Cakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour. Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour. Common flavorings include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa or extracts. They may be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the form of cupcakes and petits fours, an example of which can be the Portuguese &quot;bolo de arroz&quot;.

===Puddings===
Puddings are similar to custards in that their base is cream or milk. However, their primary difference is that puddings are thickened with starches such as corn starch or tapioca. On the other hand, custards are thickened using only eggs and are usually more firm.

===Small cakes and pastries===

Biscuits or cookies are small disks of sweetened dough, similar in composition to a cake. The term &quot;&quot;biscuit&quot; is a derivation of Latin for &quot;twice-baked&quot;, while the term &quot;cookie&quot;&quot; is a Dutch diminutive for &quot;koek&quot;, meaning cake. Some examples of this dessert include a ginger nut, shortbread biscuit and chocolate chip cookie. In Commonwealth English, the term &quot;biscuit&quot; refers to this type of dessert in general, with &quot;cookie&quot; reserved for a specific type of drop cookie; in North America, the term &quot;cookie&quot; typically refers to all forms of this dessert, with &quot;biscuit&quot; more commonly referring to a type of bread.

Other small cakes and pastries can also be counted as under these terms, due to their size and relative similarity to cookies and biscuits, such as jaffa cakes and Eccles cakes.

===Confection===
Confection, also called candy, sweets or lollies, features sugar or honey as a principal ingredient.

Many involve sugar heated into crystals with subtle differences. Dairy and sugar based include caramel, fudge and toffee or taffy. There are multiple forms of egg and sugar meringues and similar confections. Unheated sugar dissolves into icings, preservatives and sauces with other ingredients.

====Chocolate====
&quot;Theobroma cacao beans&quot; are commonly mixed with sugar to form chocolate. Pure, unsweetened dark chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids. Cocoa butter is also added in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate currently consumed is in the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture, with no milk or much less than milk chocolate.
=== Mithai (sweets) ===
Mithai, derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;&#x27;sharkara&#x27;,&quot; represents the range of Indian desserts.

===Custards===
These kinds of desserts usually include a thickened dairy base. Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs. Baked custards include crème brûlée and flan. They are often used as ingredients in other desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.
===Deep-fried===
Many cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough. In many countries, a doughnut is a flour-based batter that has been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly. Fritters are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried. Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey. Churros are a deep-fried and sugared dough that is eaten as dessert or a snack in many countries.

===Frozen===
Ice cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category. Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency. Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.

===Gelatin===

Jellied desserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another gelling agent. They are traditional in many cultures. Yōkan is a Japanese jellied dessert. In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are based on gelatin with fruit or whipped cream added. The vegetarian substitute for gelatin is agar agar. Marshmallow is also most commonly made with gelatin.

=== Pastries ===

 Pastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a croissant or unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as shortbread. Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts, and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.

====Pies, cobblers, and clafoutis====

Pies and cobblers consist of a filling enclosed by a crust, which can be made from either pastry or crumbs. The fillings of pies can vary from fruits to puddings, whereas cobbler fillings are mostly fruit-based. On the other hand, clafoutis is a dessert in which batter is poured over a fruit-based filling before being baked.

=== Sweet soups ===
Tong sui, literally translated as &quot;sugar water&quot; and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm soup or custard served as a dessert at the end of a meal in Cantonese cuisine. &quot;Tong sui&quot; are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other regional cuisines of China. Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term &quot;tong sui&quot; is not used.

===Wines===
Dessert wines are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed at higher rates as a result. Examples include Sauternes and Tokaji Aszú.

== By region ==
=== Africa ===
Throughout much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course following a meal. Fruit or fruit salad would be eaten instead, which may be spiced, or sweetened with a sauce. In some former colonies in the region, the colonial power has influenced desserts – for example, the Angolan &quot;cocada amarela&quot; (yellow coconut) resembles baked desserts in Portugal.

=== Asia ===
In Asia, desserts are often eaten between meals as snacks rather than as a concluding course. There is widespread use of rice flour in East Asian desserts, which often include local ingredients such as coconut milk, palm sugar, and tropical fruit. In India, where sugarcane has been grown and refined since before 500 BC, desserts have been an important part of the diet for thousands of years; types of desserts include burfis, halvahs, jalebis, and laddus.

Bubble tea, which originated in Taiwan, is a kind of dessert made with flavored tea or milk and tapioca. It is well known across the world.


=== Europe ===
In Ukraine and Russia, breakfast foods such as nalysnyky or blintz or oladi (pancake), and syrniki are served with honey and jam as desserts.

In the Netherlands vla is a popular dessert. It is a custard-like dessert that is served cold. Popular flavours are: vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and several fruit flavours. There is also hopjesvla which is flavoured like a Hopje, a Dutch coffee and caramel sweet.

====France====
=====Early use of the term=====
The word &quot;dessert&quot; as a culinary term appears as early as 1393 in the &quot;Ménagier de Paris&quot;, where &quot;desserte&quot; is included in three of the twenty-nine menus. The &quot;desserte&quot; comes near the end of the meal, but before the &quot;issue&quot; (departure) of hypocras and wafers, included in ten of the menus; and before the &quot;boute-hors&quot; (sendoff) of wines and spices, included in four of the menus. The &quot;desserte&quot; was the last cooked course of the meal, but the &quot;boute-hors&quot; was the true final course of the meal.

In the later printed book &quot;Petit traicté auquel verrez la maniere de faire cuisine&quot; (c. 1536), more widely known from the edition titled &quot;Livre fort excellent de cuisine&quot; (1542), the menus at the end of the book present the meal in four stages : the &quot;entree de table&quot; (entrance to the table), &quot;potaiges&quot; (foods boiled or simmered &quot;in pots&quot;), &quot;services de rost&quot; (meat or fowl &quot;roasted&quot; in dry heat), and &quot;issue de table&quot; (departure from the table). The &quot;issue de table&quot; includes fruit, nuts, pastries, jellies, cheese, and cream. The menus do not mention &quot;dessert&quot;. 

=====Dessert in the “Classical Order” of table service=====
Between the mid-16th and mid-17th century, the stages of the meal underwent several significant changes. Notably, potage became the first stage of the meal, the entrée became the second stage, entremets came to be served in their own distinct stage after the roast, and the last course of the meal came to be called “dessert”.

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the dessert stage of the meal consisted entirely of foods &quot;from the storeroom&quot; (&quot;de l’office&quot;), such as fresh, stewed, preserved, and dried fruits; fruit jellies; nuts; cheese and other dairy dishes; dry biscuits (cookies) and wafers; and, beginning in the mid-18th century, ices and petits fours. 

On lean days out of Lent, the dishes in the dessert stage of the meal were the same as those served on meat days. In Lent, though, eggs were never served at any meal, and only dishes that did not include eggs were appropriate for the dessert stage.

Despite the significance of dessert in the structured meals of the time, the dessert course was often not included on the menus or bills of fare of the 17th and 18th centuries.

=====Changes in the 19th and 20th centuries=====
In the late 19th century, the word dessert, which properly referred to the last stage of the meal, came to refer also to the dishes that were served in that stage.

In the 20th century, cheeses came to be served in their own course just before the dessert course.

Also in the 20th century, sweet dishes from the kitchen, such as freshly prepared pastries, meringues, custards, puddings, and baked fruits, which had traditionally been served in the entremets course, came to be included among the desserts. 

=== North America ===
Ice cream in The United States is popular. Pie and Cheesecake is also fairly popular in the US. Some of Mexicos favorite desserts are Flan, Paletas, and Pastel de Tres Leches.

=== South America ===

Dulce de leche is a very common confection in Argentina. In Bolivia, sugarcane, honey and coconut are traditionally used in desserts. &quot;Tawa tawa&quot; is a Bolivian sweet fritter prepared using sugar cane, and &quot;helado de canela&quot; is a dessert that is similar to sherbet which is prepared with cane sugar and cinnamon. Coconut tarts, puddings cookies and candies are also consumed in Bolivia. Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada). Peanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé-de-moleque. Local common fruits are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream. In Chile, &quot;kuchen&quot; has been described as a &quot;trademark dessert&quot;. Several desserts in Chile are prepared with &quot;manjar&quot;, (caramelized milk), including &quot;alfajor&quot;, &quot;flan&quot;, &quot;cuchufli&quot; and &quot;arroz con leche&quot;. Desserts consumed in Colombia include dulce de leche, waffle cookies, puddings, nougat, coconut with syrup and thickened milk with sugarcane syrup. Desserts in Ecuador tend to be simple, and desserts are a moderate part of the cuisine. Desserts consumed in Ecuador include tres leches cake, flan, candies and various sweets.

=== Oceania ===
In Australia, meals are often finished with dessert. This includes various fruits. More complex desserts include cakes, pies and cookies, which are sometimes served during special occasions.

New Zealand and Australia have a long-standing debate over which country invented the Pavlova. The pavlova is named after Anna Pavlova, who visited both countries in the 1920s.

== Market ==
The market for desserts has grown over the last few decades, being greatly increased by the commercialization of baking desserts and the rise of food productions. Desserts are served in most restaurants as their popularity has increased. Many commercial stores have been established as solely dessert stores. Ice cream parlors have been around since before 1800. Many businesses have started advertising campaigns focusing solely on desserts. The tactics used to market desserts are very different depending on the audience; for example, desserts can be advertised with popular movie characters to target children. The rise of companies such as Food Network has produced many shows which feature desserts and their creation. Shows like these have displayed extreme desserts and made a game show atmosphere to make desserts a more competitive field.

Desserts are a standard staple in restaurant menus, with different degrees of variety. Pie and cheesecake were among the most popular dessert courses ordered in U.S. restaurants in 2012.

== Nutrition ==
Dessert foods often contain relatively high amounts of sugar and fats and, as a result, higher calorie counts per gram than other foods. Fresh or cooked fruit with minimal added sugar or fat is an exception.

<text>The Data Encryption Standard (DES ) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.

Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency&#x27;s invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.

The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard led to its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose from classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the NSA, raising suspicions about a backdoor. The S-boxes that had prompted those suspicions were designed by the NSA to address a vulnerability they secretly knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced so that they could break the cipher by brute force attack. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.

DES is insecure due to the relatively short 56-bit key size. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see ). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Some documents distinguish between the DES standard and its algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm).

== History ==
The origins of DES date to 1972, when a National Bureau of Standards study of US government computer security identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.

Around the same time, engineer Mohamed Atalla in 1972 founded Atalla Corporation and developed the first hardware security module (HSM), the so-called &quot;Atalla Box&quot; which was commercialized in 1973. It protected offline devices with a secure PIN generating key, and was a commercial success. Banks and credit card companies were fearful that Atalla would dominate the market, which spurred the development of an international encryption standard. Atalla was an early competitor to IBM in the banking market, and was cited as an influence by IBM employees who worked on the DES standard. The IBM 3624 later adopted a similar PIN verification system to the earlier Atalla system.

On 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions was suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, IBM submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable—a cipher developed during the period 1973–1974 based on an earlier algorithm, Horst Feistel&#x27;s Lucifer cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, Walter Tuchman, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant Tuckerman.

=== NSA&#x27;s involvement in the design ===
On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was criticism received from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious &quot;S-boxes&quot; as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they—but no one else—could easily read encrypted messages. Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, &quot;We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different.&quot; The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA&#x27;s actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:

However, it also found that

Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, stated &quot;We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!&quot;
In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:

and
Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes. According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret. Coppersmith explains IBM&#x27;s secrecy decision by saying, &quot;that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.&quot; Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: &quot;[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified. They said do it. So I did it&quot;. Bruce Schneier observed that &quot;It took the academic community two decades to figure out that the NSA &#x27;tweaks&#x27; actually improved the security of DES.&quot;

=== The algorithm as a standard ===
Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as FIPS PUB 46, authorized for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing &quot;Triple DES&quot; (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following a public competition. On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but NIST has approved Triple DES through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.

The algorithm is also specified in ANSI X3.92 (Today X3 is known as INCITS and ANSI X3.92 as ANSI INCITS 92), NIST SP 800-67 and ISO/IEC 18033-3 (as a component of TDEA).

Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s DES cracker in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more detail later in this article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. According to a NIST retrospective about DES,
:The DES can be said to have &quot;jump-started&quot; the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is, trying to &quot;crack&quot;) the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer Bruce Schneier, &quot;DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study.&quot; An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared.

=== Chronology ===
==Description==
DES is the archetypal block cipher—an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another ciphertext bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the block size is 64 bits. DES also uses a key to customize the transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking parity, and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective key length is 56 bits.

The key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 bytes, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981 (Now, known as ANSI INCITS 92–1981), section 3.5:

Like other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption, but must instead be used in a mode of operation. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES. Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74.

Decryption uses the same structure as encryption, but with the keys used in reverse order. (This has the advantage that the same hardware or software can be used in both directions.)

=== Overall structure ===

The algorithm&#x27;s overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed &quot;rounds&quot;. There is also an initial and final permutation, termed &quot;IP&quot; and &quot;FP&quot;, which are inverses (IP &quot;undoes&quot; the action of FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have no cryptographic significance, but were included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s 8-bit based hardware.

Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the Feistel scheme. The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes—the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The ⊕ symbol denotes the exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. The &quot;F-function&quot; scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.

=== The Feistel (F) function ===
The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:

# &quot;Expansion&quot;: the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the &quot;expansion permutation&quot;, denoted &quot;E&quot; in the diagram, by duplicating half of the bits. The output consists of eight 6-bit (8 × 6 = 48 bits) pieces, each containing a copy of 4 corresponding input bits, plus a copy of the immediately adjacent bit from each of the input pieces to either side.
# &quot;Key mixing&quot;: the result is combined with a &quot;subkey&quot; using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys—one for each round—are derived from the main key using the &quot;key schedule&quot; (described below).
# &quot;Substitution&quot;: after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the &quot;S-boxes&quot;, or &quot;substitution boxes&quot;. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a lookup table. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES—without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
# &quot;Permutation&quot;: finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed permutation, the &quot;P-box&quot;. This is designed so that, after permutation, the bits from the output of each S-box in this round are spread across four different S-boxes in the next round.

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called &quot;confusion and diffusion&quot; respectively, a concept identified by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

=== Key schedule ===

Figure 3 illustrates the &quot;key schedule&quot; for encryption—the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by &quot;Permuted Choice 1&quot; (&quot;PC-1&quot;)—the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as parity check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by &quot;Permuted Choice 2&quot; (&quot;PC-2&quot;)—24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by &quot;«&lt;&quot; in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar—the subkeys are in reverse order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same as for encryption. The same 28 bits are passed to all rotation boxes.

=== Pseudocode ===
Pseudocode for the DES algorithm follows.

== Security and cryptanalysis ==
Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute-force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute-force attack, require an unrealistic number of known or chosen plaintexts to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

=== Brute-force attack ===
For any cipher, the most basic method of attack is brute force—trying every possible key in turn. The length of the key determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 256 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.

In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented—or, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997, RSA Security sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the DESCHALL Project, led by Rocke Verser, Matt Curtin, and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see EFF DES cracker). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: &quot;There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.&quot; The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days&#x27; worth of searching.

The next confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine built in 2006 by teams of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel, both in Germany. Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consists of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) of type XILINX Spartan-3 1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well. One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000. The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an example of the continuous improvement of digital hardware—see Moore&#x27;s law. Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH, a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000&#x27;s. SciEngines RIVYERA held the record in brute-force breaking DES, having utilized 128 Spartan-3 5000 FPGAs. Their 256 Spartan-6 LX150 model has further lowered this time.

In 2012, David Hulton and Moxie Marlinspike announced a system with 48 Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T FPGAs, each FPGA containing 40 fully pipelined DES cores running at 400 MHz, for a total capacity of 768 gigakeys/sec. The system can exhaustively search the entire 56-bit DES key space in about 26 hours and this service is offered for a fee online. However, the service has been offline since the year 2024, supposedly for maintenance but probably permanently switched off. 

=== Attacks faster than brute force ===
There are three attacks known that can break the full 16 rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: differential cryptanalysis (DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and Davies&#x27; attack. However, the attacks are theoretical and are generally considered infeasible to mount in practice; these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.

* Differential cryptanalysis was rediscovered in the late 1980s by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir; it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 247 chosen plaintexts. DES was designed to be resistant to DC.
* Linear cryptanalysis was discovered by Mitsuru Matsui, and needs 243 known plaintexts (Matsui, 1993); the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalization of LC—&quot;multiple linear cryptanalysis&quot;—was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov and others. (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (that is, 241 instead of 243). A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 239–241 DES evaluations.
* &quot;Improved Davies&#x27; attack&quot;: while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies&#x27; attack is a specialized technique for DES, first suggested by Donald Davies in the eighties, and improved by Biham and Biryukov (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 250 known plaintexts, has a computational complexity of 250, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, that is, versions of DES with fewer than 16 rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a &quot;security margin&quot; the full version retains.

Differential-linear cryptanalysis was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 215.8 chosen plaintexts and has a 229.2 time complexity (Biham and others, 2002).

=== Minor cryptanalytic properties ===
DES exhibits the complementation property, namely that
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the bitwise complement of formula_3 formula_4 denotes encryption with key formula_5 formula_6 and formula_7 denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The complementation property means that the work for a brute-force attack could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a chosen-plaintext assumption. By definition, this property also applies to TDES cipher.

DES also has four so-called &quot;weak keys&quot;. Encryption (&quot;E&quot;) and decryption (&quot;D&quot;) under a weak key have the same effect (see involution):
:formula_8 or equivalently, formula_9
There are also six pairs of &quot;semi-weak keys&quot;. Encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys, formula_10, operates identically to decryption with the other, formula_11:
:formula_12 or equivalently, formula_13
It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an attack any advantage.

DES has also been proved not to be a group, or more precisely, the set formula_14 (for all possible keys formula_15) under functional composition is not a group, nor &quot;close&quot; to being a group. This was an open question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as Triple DES would not increase the security, because repeated encryption (and decryptions) under different keys would be equivalent to encryption under another, single key.

== Simplified DES ==

Simplified DES (SDES) was designed for educational purposes only, to help students learn about modern cryptanalytic techniques.
SDES has similar structure and properties to DES, but has been simplified to make it much easier to perform encryption and decryption by hand with pencil and paper.
Some people feel that learning SDES gives insight into DES and other block ciphers, and insight into various cryptanalytic attacks against them.

== Replacement algorithms ==

Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in software motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative block cipher designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s: examples include RC5, Blowfish, IDEA, NewDES, SAFER, CAST5 and FEAL. Most of these designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the Soviet Union the GOST 28147-89 algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in Russia later.

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use Triple DES (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES&#x27;s patentees (see FIPS Pub 46–3); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is DES-X, which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. GDES was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.

On January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES. In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name Rijndael. Other finalists in the NIST AES competition included RC6, Serpent, MARS, and Twofish.

<doc id="7983" wikidata="Q18206629" url="?curid=7983" title="Double-hulled tanker">
<text>A double-hulled tanker refers to an oil tanker which has a double hull. They reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring compared to single-hulled tankers, and their ability to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for oil tankers and other types of ships including by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. After the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill disaster in Alaska in 1989, the US government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull.

==Reasons for use==
A number of manufacturers have embraced oil tankers with a double hull because it strengthens the hull of ships, reducing the likelihood of oil disasters in low-impact collisions and groundings over single-hull ships. They reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is under pilotage. Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U-shaped tanks might be susceptible to &quot;free flooding&quot; across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water. In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.

The ability of double-hulled tankers to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for other types of ships including oil tankers by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. In 1992, MARPOL was amended, making it &quot;mandatory for tankers of 5,000 dwt and more ordered after 6 July 1993 to be fitted with double hulls, or an alternative design approved by IMO&quot;. However, in the aftermath of the Erika incident of the coast off France in December 1999, members of IMO adopted a revised schedule for the phase-out of single-hull tankers, which came into effect on 1 September 2003, with further amendments validated on 5 April 2005.

After the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill disaster, when that ship grounded on Bligh Reef outside the port of Valdez, Alaska in 1989, the US government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull. However, the damage to the Exxon Valdez penetrated sections of the hull (the slops oil tanks, or slop tanks) that were protected by a double bottom, or partial double hull.

==Maintenance issues==

Although double-hulled tankers reduce the likelihood of ships grazing rocks and creating holes in the hull, a double hull does not protect against major, high-energy collisions or groundings which cause the majority of oil pollution, despite this being the reason that the double hull was mandated by United States legislation. Double-hulled tankers, if poorly designed, constructed, maintained and operated can be as problematic, if not more problematic than their single-hulled counterparts. Double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts, which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating, which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing, may cause problems. Double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least 20%, and because the steel weight of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of single-hulled ships, the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear. Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.

Although several international conventions against pollution are in place, as of 2003 there was still no formal body setting international mandatory standards, although the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) does provide guidelines giving advice on optimum use and safety, such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo, and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas. Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull. The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the &quot;Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures&quot; in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.

<text>A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history.

In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer, wine and cocktails, but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.

==Biology==
When the human body becomes dehydrated, a person experiences thirst. This craving of fluids results in an instinctive &quot;need to drink&quot;. Thirst is regulated by the hypothalamus in response to subtle changes in the body&#x27;s electrolyte levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating. The complete deprivation of drinks (that is, water) will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance besides oxygen. Water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history. As water is essential for life, it has also been the carrier of many diseases.

As society developed, techniques were discovered to create alcoholic drinks from the plants that were available in different areas. The earliest archaeological evidence of wine production yet found has been at sites in Georgia ( BCE) and Iran ( BCE). Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 3000 BCE, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. The invention of beer (and bread) has been argued to be responsible for humanity&#x27;s ability to develop technology and build civilization. Tea likely originated in Yunnan, China, during the Shang dynasty (1500 BCE–1046 BCE) as a medicinal drink.

==History==
Drinking has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries. In ancient Greece, a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a symposium, where watered down wine would be drunk. The purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence. In ancient Rome, a similar concept of a &quot;convivium&quot; took place regularly.

Many early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods, leading to the creation of gods such as Dionysus. Other religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic drinks for various reasons. In some regions with a dominant religion the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic drinks is forbidden to everybody, regardless of religion.

Toasting is a method of honoring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink. Another tradition is that of the loving cup, at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle, shared by everyone until empty.

In East Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the Ethiopian Church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor Menelik II. The drink was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.

== Production ==
A drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption. The preparation can include a number of different steps, some prior to transport, others immediately prior to consumption.

===Purification of water===
Water is the chief constituent in all drinks, and the primary ingredient in most. Water is purified prior to drinking. Methods for purification include filtration and the addition of chemicals, such as chlorination. The importance of purified water is highlighted by the World Health Organization, who point out 94% of deaths from diarrhea – the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually – could be prevented by improving the quality of the victim&#x27;s environment, particularly safe water.

===Pasteurization===
Pasteurization is the process of heating a liquid for a period of time at a specified temperature, then immediately cooling. The process reduces the growth of microorganisms within the liquid, thereby increasing the time before spoilage. It is primarily used on milk, which prior to pasteurization is commonly infected with pathogenic bacteria and therefore is more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness.

===Juicing===

The process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms. Simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid, though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit. Both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine.

===Infusion===
Infusion is the process of extracting flavors from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water. This process is used in the production of teas, herbal teas and can be used to prepare coffee (when using a coffee press).

===Percolation===
The name is derived from the word &quot;percolate&quot; which means &quot;to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent&quot;. In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.

===Carbonation===
Carbonation is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide into a liquid, such as water.

===Fermentation===
Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to ethanol. Fermentation has been used by humans for the production of drinks since the Neolithic age. In winemaking, grape juice is combined with yeast in an anaerobic environment to allow the fermentation. The amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the sweetness of the wine.

When brewing beer, there are four primary ingredients – water, grain, yeast and hops. The grain is encouraged to germinate by soaking and drying in heat, a process known as malting. It is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation. This process is known as mashing. Hops are added for flavouring, then the yeast is added to the mixture (now called wort) to start the fermentation process.

===Distillation===

Distillation is a method of separating mixtures based on differences in volatility of components in a boiling liquid mixture. It is one of the methods used in the purification of water. It is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic drinks.

===Mixing===
An alcoholic mixed drink that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail. Cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. The term is now often used for almost any mixed drink that contains alcohol, including mixers, mixed shots, etc. A cocktail today usually contains one or more kinds of spirit and one or more mixers, such as soda or fruit juice. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs.

==Type==

===Non-alcoholic drinks===
A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no alcohol. This category includes low-alcohol beer, non-alcoholic wine, and apple cider if they contain a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume (ABV). The exact definition of what is &quot;non-alcoholic&quot; and what is not depends on local laws: in the United Kingdom, &quot;alcohol-free beer&quot; is under 0.05% ABV, &quot;de-alcoholised beer&quot; is under 0.5%, while &quot;low-alcohol beer&quot; can contain no more than 1.2% ABV. The term &quot;soft drink&quot; specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to &quot;hard drink&quot; and &quot;drink&quot;. The term &quot;drink&quot; is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop, sparkling water, iced tea, lemonade, root beer, fruit punch, milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, tap water, bottled water, juice, and energy drinks are all soft drinks.

====Water====
Water is the world&#x27;s most consumed drink, however, 97% of water on Earth is non-drinkable salt water. Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, and frozen glaciers. Less than 1% of the Earth&#x27;s fresh water supplies are accessible through surface water and underground sources which are cost effective to retrieve.

In western cultures, water is often drunk cold. In the Chinese culture, it is typically drunk hot.

====Milk====
Milk is regarded as one of the &quot;original&quot; drinks; milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies. In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a drink.

====Carbonated drinks====
Carbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them. This can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure. The first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by Thomas Henry in the late 1770s.
Cola, orange, various roots, ginger, and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; sugars and preservatives may be added later.

The most consumed carbonated soft drinks are produced by three major global brands: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

====Hot drinks====
These drinks are often served warm or hot.

=====Coffee=====
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus &quot;Coffea&quot;. The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded &quot;Coffea arabica&quot;, and the &quot;robusta&quot; form of the hardier &quot;Coffea canephora&quot;. Coffee plants are cultivated in more than 70 countries. Once ripe, coffee &quot;berries&quot; are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

Coffee is slightly acidic (pH 5.0–5.1) and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; however, results have varied in terms of coffee&#x27;s relative benefit.

Coffee cultivation first took place in southern Arabia; the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.

Coffee may have been used socially in the renaissance period of the 17th century. The increasing trades between Europe and North Africa regions made coffee more widely available to Europeans gathering at social locations that served coffee, possibly contributing to the growth of coffeehouses.

=====Hot chocolate=====
Hot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate or cocoa, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.

The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.

Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced &quot;chocolate para mesa&quot; of Latin America, the very thick &quot;cioccolata calda&quot; served in Italy and &quot;chocolate a la taza&quot; served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.

=====Tea=====

Tea, the second most consumed drink in the world, is produced from infusing dried leaves of the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; shrub, in boiling water. There are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption: lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide. Other additions include butter and salt in Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet; bubble tea in Taiwan; fresh ginger in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; mint in North Africa and Senegal; cardamom in Central Asia; rum to make Jagertee in Central Europe; and coffee to make yuanyang in Hong Kong. Tea is also served differently from country to country: in China, Japan and South Korea tiny cups are used to serve tea; in Thailand and the United States tea is often served cold (as &quot;iced tea&quot;) or with a lot of sweetener; Indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as masala chai; tea is brewed with a samovar in Iran, Kashmir, Russia and Turkey; and in the Australian Outback it is traditionally brewed in a billycan.
Tea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different. Chinese yellow and green tea are steamed, roasted and dried; Oolong tea is semi-oxidised and appears green-black and black teas are fully oxidised.

=====Herbal tea=====

Around the world, people refer to other herbal infusions as &quot;teas&quot;; it is also argued that these were popular long before the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; shrub was used for tea making. Leaves, flowers, roots or bark can be used to make a herbal infusion and can be bought fresh, dried or powdered.

====Juice and plant drinks====
Fruit juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as orange juice and tangerine juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while grapefruit juice, pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. Coconut water is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces wine.

Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Fruits can also be blended with ice and other ingredients to make a smoothie. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.

Vegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Plant milk is a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source. The most common varieties internationally are soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk and oat milk.

===Sleep drinks===
A nightcap is a drink taken shortly before bedtime to induce sleep. For example, a small alcoholic drink or a cup of warm milk can supposedly promote a good night&#x27;s sleep. Today, most nightcaps and relaxation drinks are generally non-alcoholic beverages containing calming ingredients. They are considered beverages which serve to relax a person. Unlike other calming beverages, such as tea, warm milk or milk with honey; relaxation drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient. Relaxation drinks have been known to contain other natural ingredients and are usually free of caffeine and alcohol but some have claimed to contain marijuana.

===Alcoholic drinks===
A drink is considered &quot;alcoholic&quot; if it contains ethanol, commonly known as alcohol (although in chemistry the definition of &quot;alcohol&quot; includes many other compounds). Beer has been a part of human civilisation for around 8,000 years.

====Beer====
Beer is an alcoholic drink produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Most beer is also flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called brewing. Beer is the world&#x27;s most widely consumed alcoholic drink, and is the third-most consumed drink overall, after water and tea. It is said to have been discovered by goddess Ninkasi around 5300 BCE, when she accidentally discovered yeast after leaving grain in jars that were later rained upon and left for several days. Women have been the chief creators of beer throughout history due to its association with domesticity and it, throughout much of history, being brewed in the home for family consumption. Only in recent history have men begun to dabble in the field. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented drink.

Some of humanity&#x27;s earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and &quot;The Hymn to Ninkasi&quot;, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.

====Cider====
Cider is a fermented alcoholic drink made from fruit juice, most commonly and traditionally apple juice, but also the juice of peaches, pears (&quot;Perry&quot; cider) or other fruit. Cider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain cultivars grown solely for use in cider are known as cider apples. The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world, , the U.K. produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons).

====Wine====
Wine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, terroir and subsequent appellation, along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.

Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, rice wine, pomegranate wine, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine. The term &quot;wine&quot; can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified drinks having higher alcohol content, such as barley wine, huangjiu, or sake.

Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred  BC in Georgia. It had reached the Balkans by  BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece and Rome.

From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. Red wine was closely associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians, who, according to Plutarch, avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC Saite dynasty, &quot;thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods&quot;. The Greek cult and mysteries of Dionysus, carried on by the Romans in their Bacchanalia, were the origins of western theater. Judaism incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in its Eucharist, while alcohol consumption was forbidden in Islam.

====Spirits====
Spirits are distilled beverages that contain no added sugar and have at least 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). Popular spirits include borovička, brandy, gin, rum, slivovitz, tequila, vodka, and whisky. Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any starch- or sugar-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye, or wheat.

==In culture==

===Places to drink===
Throughout history, people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking. This includes cafés and coffeehouses, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the Middle East, and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world, offer &quot;shisha&quot; (&quot;nargile&quot; in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. Espresso bars are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.

In China and Japan, the establishment would be a tea house, where people would socialise while drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse as a place to share ideas.

Alcoholic drinks are served in drinking establishments, which have different cultural connotations. For example, pubs are fundamental to the culture of The United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New England, Metro Detroit, South Africa and New Zealand. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of Samuel Pepys describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so cask ale or keg beer may be a better value than wines and spirits.

In contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed &quot;dive bars&quot;, to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term &quot;bar&quot; is derived from the specialized counter on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, go-go dancers, or strippers. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the bartender, or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.

===Matching with food===

Food and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.

===Presentation===
Different drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption. This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or brandy snifters which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.

Many glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne&#x27;s signature carbonation, by reducing the surface area at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a champagne coupe, the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard wine glass.

==Commercial trade==

===International exports and imports===
An important export commodity, coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,
and it was the world&#x27;s seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.

===Investment===
Some drinks, such as wine, can be used as an alternative investment. This can be achieved by either purchasing and reselling individual bottles or cases of particular wines, or purchasing shares in an investment wine fund that pools investors&#x27; capital.

<text>Dill (Anethum graveolens) is an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae. It is native to North Africa, Iran, and the Arabian Peninsula; it is grown widely in Eurasia, where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;dill&quot; and its close relatives are found in most of the Germanic languages; its ultimate origin is unknown.

=== Taxonomy ===
The genus name &quot;Anethum&quot; is the Latin form of Greek ἄνῑσον / ἄνησον / ἄνηθον / ἄνητον, which meant both &quot;dill&quot; and &quot;anise&quot;. The form &#x27;anīsum&#x27; came to be used for anise, and &#x27;anēthum&#x27; for dill. The Latin word is the origin of dill&#x27;s names in the Western Romance languages (&#x27;anet&#x27;, &#x27;aneldo&#x27; etc.), and also of the obsolete English &#x27;anet&#x27;.

== Botany ==

Dill grows up to from a taproot like a carrot. Its stems are slender and hollow with finely divided, softly delicate leaves; the leaves are alternately arranged, long with ultimate leaf divisions are broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of fennel, which are threadlike, less than broad, but harder in texture.


In hot or dry weather, small white to yellow scented flowers form in small umbels diameter from one long stalk. The seeds come from dried up fruit long and thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.

== Cultivation ==
Successful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well-drained soil. The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm, dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.

These plants, like their fennel and parsley relatives, often are eaten by black swallowtail caterpillars in areas where that species occurs. For this reason, they may be included in some butterfly gardens.

== History ==
Dill has been found in the tomb of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep II, dating to around 1400 BC. It was also later found in the Greek city of Samos, around the 7th century BC, and mentioned in the writings of Theophrastus (371–287 BC). In Greek mythology, the dill was originally a young man named Anethus who was transformed into the plant.

Fresh and dried dill leaves (sometimes called &quot;dill weed&quot; or &quot;dillweed&quot; to distinguish it from dill seed) are widely used as herbs in Europe and in central and south-eastern Asia.

Like caraway, the fern-like leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavour many foods such as gravlax (cured salmon) and other fish dishes, borscht, and other soups, as well as pickles (where the dill flower is sometimes used). Dill is best when used fresh, as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried. However, freeze-dried dill leaves retain their flavour relatively well for a few months.

Dill oil is extracted from the leaves, stems, and seeds of the plant. The oil from the seeds is distilled and used in the manufacturing of soaps.

Dill is the eponymous ingredient in dill pickles.

====Central and eastern Europe ====
In central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries, the Baltic states, Ukraine, and Russia, dill is a staple culinary herb along with chives and parsley. Fresh, finely cut dill leaves are used as a topping in soups, especially the hot red borsht and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yogurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called &#x27;okroshka&#x27;. It also is popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yogurt, or buttermilk) mixed with dill (and sometimes other herbs).

In the same way, dill is used as a topping for boiled potatoes covered with fresh butter – especially in summer when there are so-called new, or young, potatoes. The dill leaves may be mixed with butter, making a dill butter, to serve the same purpose. Dill leaves mixed with tvorog form one of the traditional cheese spreads used for sandwiches. Fresh dill leaves are used throughout the year as an ingredient in salads, &quot;e.g.&quot;, one made of lettuce, fresh cucumbers, and tomatoes, as basil leaves are used in Italy and Greece.

Russian cuisine is noted for liberal use of dill, where it is known as . It is supposed to have antiflatulent properties; some Russian cosmonauts recommended its use in human spaceflight due to such properties being beneficial in confined quarters with a closed air supply.

In Polish cuisine, fresh dill leaves mixed with sour cream are the basis for dressings. It is especially popular to use this kind of sauce with freshly cut cucumbers, which are almost wholly immersed in the sauce, making a salad called &#x27;mizeria&#x27;. Dill sauce is used hot for baked freshwater fish and for chicken or turkey breast, or used hot or cold for hard-boiled eggs. A dill-based soup, (zupa koperkowa), served with potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, is popular in Poland. Whole stems including roots and flower buds are used traditionally to prepare Polish-style pickled cucumbers (ogórki kiszone), especially the so-called low-salt cucumbers (ogórki małosolne). Whole stems of dill (often including the roots) also are cooked with potatoes, especially the potatoes of autumn and winter, so they resemble the flavour of the newer potatoes found in summer. Some kinds of fish, especially trout and salmon, traditionally are baked with the stems and leaves of dill.

In the Czech Republic, white dill sauce made of cream (or milk), butter, flour, vinegar, and dill is called &#x27;koprová omáčka&#x27; (also &#x27;koprovka&#x27; or &#x27;kopračka&#x27;) and is served either with boiled eggs and potatoes, or with dumplings and boiled beef. Another Czech dish with dill is a soup called &#x27;kulajda&#x27; that contains mushrooms (traditionally wild ones).

In Germany, dill is popular as a seasoning for fish and many other dishes, chopped as a garnish on potatoes, and as a flavouring in pickles.

In the UK, dill may be used in fish pie.

In Bulgaria dill is widely used in traditional vegetable salads, and most notably the yogurt-based cold soup Tarator. It is also used in the preparation of sour pickles, cabbage, and other dishes.

In Romania dill (mărar) is widely used as an ingredient for soups such as &#x27;borş&#x27; (pronounced &quot;borsh&quot;), pickles, and other dishes, especially those based on peas, beans, and cabbage. It is popular for dishes based on potatoes and mushrooms and may be found in many summer salads (especially cucumber salad, cabbage salad and lettuce salad). During springtime, it is used in omelets with spring onions. It often complements sauces based on sour cream or yogurt and is mixed with salted cheese and used as a filling. Another popular dish with dill as a main ingredient is dill sauce, which is served with eggs and fried sausages.

In Hungary, dill is very widely used. It is popular as a sauce or filling, and mixed with a type of cottage cheese. Dill is also used for pickling and in salads. The Hungarian name for dill is &#x27;kapor&#x27;.

In Serbia, dill is known as &#x27;mirodjija&#x27; and is used as an addition to soups, potato and cucumber salads, and French fries. It features in the Serbian proverb, &quot;бити мирођија у свакој чорби&quot; /biti mirodjija u svakoj čorbi/ (to be a dill in every soup), which corresponds to the English proverb &quot;to have a finger in every pie&quot;.

In Greece, dill is known as &#x27;άνηθος&#x27; (anithos). In antiquity it was used as an ingredient in wines that were called &quot;anithites oinos&quot; (wine with anithos-dill). In modern days, dill is used in salads, soups, sauces, and fish and vegetable dishes.

In Santa Maria, Azores, dill (endro) is the most important ingredient of the traditional Holy Ghost soup (sopa do Espírito Santo). Dill is found ubiquitously in Santa Maria, yet, is rare in the other Azorean Islands.

In Sweden, dill is a common spice or herb. The flowers of fully grown dill are called &#x27;krondill&#x27; (crown dill) and used when cooking crayfish. The krondill is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is refrigerated for at least 24 hours before being served (with toasted bread and butter). Krondill is also used to flavor pickles and vodka. After a month or two of fermentation, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce, and potatoes, as a sweetener. The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (especially the first potatoes of the year, new potatoes, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). In salads it is used together with, or instead, of other green herbs, such as parsley, chives, and basil. It is often paired up with chives when used in food. Dill is often used to flavour fish and seafood in Sweden, for example, gravlax and various herring pickles, among them the traditional, &#x27;sill i dill&#x27; (literally &#x27;herring in dill&#x27;). In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called, &#x27;dillkött&#x27;, which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. Dill seeds may be used in breads or &#x27;akvavit&#x27;. A newer, non-traditional use of dill is to pair it with chives as a flavouring for potato chips. These are called &#x27;dillchips&#x27; and are quite popular in Sweden.

In Finland, the uses of dill are very similar to those in Sweden, including flavouring potato chips and, less popularly, in a dish similar to &#x27;dillkött&#x27; (&#x27;tilliliha&#x27;). However, the use of dill in Finland is not as extensive as in large parts of central and eastern Europe, particularly Russia but including even the ethnolinguistically close Estonia.

==== Asia and Middle East ====

In Iran, dill is known as &#x27;shevid&#x27; and sometimes, is used with rice and called &#x27;shevid-polo&#x27;. It also is used in Iranian &#x27;aash&#x27; recipes, and similarly, is called in Persian.

In India, dill is known as &#x27;Sholpa&#x27; in Bengali, (शेपू) in Marathi, sheppi (शेप्पी) in Konkani, in Hindi, or in Punjabi. In Telugu, it is called &#x27;Soa-kura&#x27; (herb greens). It also is called (ಸಬ್ಬಸಿಗೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪು) in Kannada. In Tamil it is known as (சதகுப்பி). In Malayalam, it is ചതകുപ്പ () or (). In Sanskrit, this herb is called . In Gujarati, it is known as (સૂવા). In India, dill is prepared in the manner of yellow &#x27;moong dal&#x27;, as a main-course dish. It is considered to have very good antiflatulent properties, so it is used as &#x27;mukhwas&#x27;, or an after-meal digestive. Traditionally, it is given to mothers immediately after childbirth. In the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, a small amount of fresh dill is cooked along with cut potatoes and fresh fenugreek leaves (Hindi आलू-मेथी-सोया).

In Manipur, dill, locally known as , is an essential ingredient of – a traditional Manipuri dish made with fermented soybean and rice.

In Laos and parts of northern Thailand, dill is known in English as Lao coriander ( or ), and served as a side with salad yum or papaya salad. In the Lao language, it is called &#x27;phak see&#x27;, and in Thai, it is known as &#x27;phak chee Lao&#x27;. In Lao cuisine, Lao coriander is used extensively in traditional Lao dishes such as &#x27;mok pa&#x27; (steamed fish in banana leaf) and several coconut milk curries that contain fish or prawns.

In China dill is called colloquially, &#x27;huíxiāng&#x27; (, perfume of Hui people), or more properly &#x27;shíluó&#x27; (). It is a common filling in &#x27;baozi&#x27;, &#x27;jiaozi&#x27; and &#x27;xianbing&#x27; and may be used as vegetarian with rice vermicelli, or combined with either meat or eggs. Vegetarian dill baozi are a common part of a Beijing breakfast. In baozi and xianbing, it often is interchangeable with non-bulbing fennel and the term also may refer to fennel, similarly to caraway and coriander leaf, sharing a name in Chinese as well. Dill also may be stir fried as a potherb, often with egg, in the same manner as Chinese chives. In Northern China, Beijing, Inner-Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, and Xinjiang, dill seeds commonly are called &#x27;zīrán&#x27; (), but also &#x27;kūmíng&#x27; (), &#x27;kūmíngzi&#x27; (), &#x27;shíluózi&#x27; (), &#x27;xiǎohuíxiāngzi&#x27; () and are used with pepper for lamb meat. In the whole of China, &#x27;yángchuàn&#x27; () or &#x27;yángròu chuàn&#x27; (), lamb brochette, a speciality from Uyghurs, uses cumin and pepper. 

In Taiwan, it is also commonly used as a filling in steamed buns (baozi) and dumplings (jiaozi).

In Vietnam, the use of dill in cooking is regional. It is used mainly in northern Vietnamese cuisine.

==== Middle East ====
In Arab countries, dill seed, called (grasshopper&#x27;s eye), is used as a spice in cold dishes such as &#x27;fattoush&#x27; and pickles. In Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, dill is called &#x27;shibint&#x27; and is used mostly in fish dishes. In Egypt, dillweed is commonly used to flavour cabbage dishes, including &#x27;mahshi koronb&#x27; (stuffed cabbage leaves). In Israel, dill weed is used in salads and also to flavour omelettes, often alongside parsley.

=== Companion planting ===

When used as a companion plant, dill attracts many beneficial insects as the umbrella flower heads go to seed. It makes a good companion plant for cucumbers and broccoli.

Tomato plants benefit from dill when it is young because it repels harmful pests while attracting pollinators. But the dill must be pruned before it flowers, otherwise it can slow or stop the growth of the tomatoes.

<text>In mathematics, any vector space &quot;formula_1&quot; has a corresponding dual vector space (or just dual space for short) consisting of all linear forms on &quot;formula_2&quot; together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants.

The dual space as defined above is defined for all vector spaces, and to avoid ambiguity may also be called the .
When defined for a topological vector space, there is a subspace of the dual space, corresponding to continuous linear functionals, called the continuous dual space.

Dual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces, such as in tensor analysis with finite-dimensional vector spaces.
When applied to vector spaces of functions (which are typically infinite-dimensional), dual spaces are used to describe measures, distributions, and Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the dual space is an important concept in functional analysis.

Early terms for &quot;dual&quot; include &quot;polarer Raum&quot; [Hahn 1927], &quot;espace conjugué&quot;, &quot;adjoint space&quot; [Alaoglu 1940], and &quot;transponierter Raum&quot; [Schauder 1930] and [Banach 1932]. The term &quot;dual&quot; is due to Bourbaki 1938.

== Algebraic dual space ==

Given any vector space formula_1 over a field formula_4, the (algebraic) dual space formula_5 (alternatively denoted by formula_6 or formula_7) is defined as the set of all linear maps &quot;formula_8&quot; (linear functionals). Since linear maps are vector space homomorphisms, the dual space may be denoted formula_9.
The dual space formula_10 itself becomes a vector space over &quot;formula_4&quot; when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying:
: formula_12
for all formula_13, &quot;formula_14&quot;, and formula_15.

Elements of the algebraic dual space formula_10 are sometimes called covectors, one-forms, or linear forms.

The pairing of a functional &quot;formula_17&quot; in the dual space formula_10 and an element &quot;formula_19&quot; of &quot;formula_1&quot; is sometimes denoted by a bracket: &quot;formula_21&quot;
or &quot;formula_22&quot;. This pairing defines a nondegenerate bilinear mapping formula_23 called the natural pairing.

=== Finite-dimensional case ===

If formula_1 is finite-dimensional, then formula_10 has the same dimension as formula_1. Given a basis formula_27 in formula_1, it is possible to construct a specific basis in formula_10, called the dual basis. This dual basis is a set formula_30 of linear functionals on formula_1, defined by the relation
: formula_32
for any choice of coefficients formula_33. In particular, letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero, gives the system of equations
: formula_34
where formula_35 is the Kronecker delta symbol. This property is referred to as the &quot;bi-orthogonality property&quot;.
Consider formula_27 the basis of V. Let formula_30 be defined as the following:

formula_32.

These are a basis of formula_10 because:

# The formula_40 are linear functionals, which map formula_41 such as formula_42 and formula_43 to scalars formula_44 and formula_45. Then also, formula_46 and formula_47. Therefore, formula_48 for formula_49.
# Suppose formula_50. Applying this functional on the basis vectors of formula_51 successively, lead us to formula_52 (The functional applied in formula_53 results in formula_54). Therefore, formula_30 is linearly independent on formula_10.
#Lastly, consider formula_57. Then
:formula_58
and formula_30 generates formula_10. Hence, it is a basis of formula_61. 
For example, if formula_1 is formula_63, let its basis be chosen as formula_64. The basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other. Then, formula_65 and formula_66 are one-forms (functions that map a vector to a scalar) such that formula_67, formula_68, formula_69, and formula_70. (Note: The superscript here is the index, not an exponent.) This system of equations can be expressed using matrix notation as
:formula_71
Solving for the unknown values in the first matrix shows the dual basis to be formula_72. Because formula_65 and formula_66 are functionals, they can be rewritten as formula_75 and formula_76.

In general, when formula_1 is formula_78, if formula_79 is a matrix whose columns are the basis vectors and formula_80 is a matrix whose columns are the dual basis vectors, then
:formula_81
where formula_82 is the identity matrix of order formula_83. The biorthogonality property of these two basis sets allows any point formula_84 to be represented as
:formula_85
even when the basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other. Strictly speaking, the above statement only makes sense once the inner product formula_86 and the corresponding duality pairing are introduced, as described below in &quot;&quot;.

In particular, formula_78 can be interpreted as the space of columns of formula_83 real numbers, its dual space is typically written as the space of &quot;rows&quot; of formula_83 real numbers. Such a row acts on formula_78 as a linear functional by ordinary matrix multiplication. This is because a functional maps every formula_83-vector formula_19 into a real number formula_93. Then, seeing this functional as a matrix formula_94, and formula_19 as an formula_96 matrix, and formula_93 a formula_98 matrix (trivially, a real number) respectively, if formula_99 then, by dimension reasons, formula_94 must be a formula_101 matrix; that is, formula_94 must be a row vector.

If formula_1 consists of the space of geometrical vectors in the plane, then the level curves of an element of formula_10 form a family of parallel lines in formula_1, because the range is 1-dimensional, so that every point in the range is a multiple of any one nonzero element.
So an element of formula_10 can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane. To compute the value of a functional on a given vector, it suffices to determine which of the lines the vector lies on. Informally, this &quot;counts&quot; how many lines the vector crosses.
More generally, if formula_1 is a vector space of any dimension, then the level sets of a linear functional in formula_10 are parallel hyperplanes in formula_1, and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes.

=== Infinite-dimensional case ===

If formula_1 is not finite-dimensional but has a basis formula_111 indexed by an infinite set formula_112, then the same construction as in the finite-dimensional case yields linearly independent elements formula_113 (formula_114) of the dual space, but they will not form a basis.

For instance, consider the space formula_115, whose elements are those sequences of real numbers that contain only finitely many non-zero entries, which has a basis indexed by the natural numbers formula_116. For formula_117, formula_118 is the sequence consisting of all zeroes except in the formula_119-th position, which is 1.
The dual space of formula_115 is (isomorphic to) formula_121, the space of &quot;all&quot; sequences of real numbers: each real sequence formula_122 defines a function where the element formula_123 of formula_115 is sent to the number

:formula_125

which is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero formula_126. The dimension of formula_115 is countably infinite, whereas formula_121 does not have a countable basis.

This observation generalizes to any infinite-dimensional vector space formula_1 over any field formula_4: a choice of basis formula_131 identifies formula_1 with the space formula_133 of functions formula_134 such that formula_135 is nonzero for only finitely many formula_114, where such a function formula_137 is identified with the vector

:formula_138

in formula_1 (the sum is finite by the assumption on formula_137, and any formula_141 may be written uniquely in this way by the definition of the basis).

The dual space of formula_1 may then be identified with the space formula_143 of &quot;all&quot; functions from formula_112 to formula_4: a linear functional formula_146 on formula_1 is uniquely determined by the values formula_148 it takes on the basis of formula_1, and any function formula_150 (with formula_151) defines a linear functional formula_146 on formula_1 by

:formula_154

Again, the sum is finite because formula_155 is nonzero for only finitely many formula_156.

The set formula_133 may be identified (essentially by definition) with the direct sum of infinitely many copies of formula_4 (viewed as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself) indexed by formula_112, i.e. there are linear isomorphisms
:formula_160

On the other hand, formula_143 is (again by definition), the direct product of infinitely many copies of formula_4 indexed by formula_112, and so the identification
:formula_164
is a special case of a general result relating direct sums (of modules) to direct products.

If a vector space is not finite-dimensional, then its (algebraic) dual space is &quot;always&quot; of larger dimension (as a cardinal number) than the original vector space. This is in contrast to the case of the continuous dual space, discussed below, which may be isomorphic to the original vector space even if the latter is infinite-dimensional.

The proof of this inequality between dimensions results from the following.

If formula_1 is an infinite-dimensional formula_4-vector space, the arithmetical properties of cardinal numbers implies that 
:formula_167
where cardinalities are denoted as absolute values. For proving that formula_168 it suffices to prove that formula_169 which can be done with an argument similar to Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument. The exact dimension of the dual is given by the Erdős–Kaplansky theorem.

=== Bilinear products and dual spaces ===

If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, then &quot;V&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;V&quot;∗. But there is in general no natural isomorphism between these two spaces. Any bilinear form on &quot;V&quot; gives a mapping of &quot;V&quot; into its dual space via

:formula_170

where the right hand side is defined as the functional on &quot;V&quot; taking each to . In other words, the bilinear form determines a linear mapping

:formula_171

defined by

:formula_172

If the bilinear form is nondegenerate, then this is an isomorphism onto a subspace of &quot;V&quot;∗.
If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, then this is an isomorphism onto all of &quot;V&quot;∗. Conversely, any isomorphism formula_173 from &quot;V&quot; to a subspace of &quot;V&quot;∗ (resp., all of &quot;V&quot;∗ if &quot;V&quot; is finite dimensional) defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form on &quot;V&quot; by

:formula_174

Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of &quot;V&quot; to a subspace of (resp., all of) &quot;V&quot;∗ and nondegenerate bilinear forms on &quot;V&quot;.

If the vector space &quot;V&quot; is over the complex field, then sometimes it is more natural to consider sesquilinear forms instead of bilinear forms.
In that case, a given sesquilinear form determines an isomorphism of &quot;V&quot; with the complex conjugate of the dual space

: formula_175
The conjugate of the dual space formula_176 can be identified with the set of all additive complex-valued functionals such that
: formula_177

=== Injection into the double-dual ===
There is a natural homomorphism formula_178 from formula_1 into the double dual formula_180, defined by formula_181 for all formula_182. In other words, if formula_183 is the evaluation map defined by formula_184, then formula_185 is defined as the map formula_186. This map formula_178 is always injective; and it is always an isomorphism if formula_1 is finite-dimensional.
Indeed, the isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual is an archetypal example of a natural isomorphism.
Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not isomorphic to their algebraic double duals, but instead to their continuous double duals.

=== Transpose of a linear map ===

If is a linear map, then the &quot;transpose&quot; (or &quot;dual&quot;) is defined by
: formula_189
for every &quot;formula_190&quot;. The resulting functional &quot;formula_191&quot; in &quot;formula_10&quot; is called the &quot;pullback&quot; of &quot;formula_17&quot; along &quot;formula_137&quot;.

The following identity holds for all &quot;formula_190&quot; and &quot;formula_196&quot;:
: formula_197
where the bracket [·,·] on the left is the natural pairing of &quot;V&quot; with its dual space, and that on the right is the natural pairing of &quot;W&quot; with its dual. This identity characterizes the transpose, and is formally similar to the definition of the adjoint.

The assignment produces an injective linear map between the space of linear operators from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; and the space of linear operators from &quot;W&quot; to &quot;V&quot;; this homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if &quot;W&quot; is finite-dimensional.
If then the space of linear maps is actually an algebra under composition of maps, and the assignment is then an antihomomorphism of algebras, meaning that .
In the language of category theory, taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a contravariant functor from the category of vector spaces over &quot;F&quot; to itself.
It is possible to identify (&quot;f&quot;) with &quot;f&quot; using the natural injection into the double dual.

If the linear map &quot;f&quot; is represented by the matrix &quot;A&quot; with respect to two bases of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is represented by the transpose matrix &quot;A&quot;T with respect to the dual bases of &quot;W&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, hence the name.
Alternatively, as &quot;f&quot; is represented by &quot;A&quot; acting on the left on column vectors, &quot;f&quot; is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors.
These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on R&quot;n&quot;, which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors.

=== Quotient spaces and annihilators ===

Let formula_198 be a subset of formula_1.
The annihilator of formula_198 in formula_10, denoted here formula_202, is the collection of linear functionals formula_203 such that formula_204 for all formula_205.
That is, formula_202 consists of all linear functionals formula_207 such that the restriction to formula_198 vanishes: formula_209.
Within finite dimensional vector spaces, the annihilator is dual to (isomorphic to) the orthogonal complement.

The annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space.
The annihilator of the zero vector is the whole dual space: formula_210, and the annihilator of the whole space is just the zero covector: formula_211.
Furthermore, the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of formula_1 reverses inclusions, so that if formula_213, then
: formula_214

If formula_112 and formula_216 are two subsets of formula_1 then
: formula_218
If formula_219 is any family of subsets of formula_1 indexed by formula_119 belonging to some index set formula_222, then
: formula_223
In particular if formula_112 and formula_216 are subspaces of formula_1 then
: formula_227
and
: formula_228

If formula_1 is finite-dimensional and formula_230 is a vector subspace, then
: formula_231
after identifying formula_230 with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism formula_233. In particular, forming the annihilator is a Galois connection on the lattice of subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space.

If formula_230 is a subspace of formula_1 then the quotient space formula_236 is a vector space in its own right, and so has a dual. By the first isomorphism theorem, a functional formula_207 factors through formula_236 if and only if formula_230 is in the kernel of formula_137. There is thus an isomorphism
: formula_241
As a particular consequence, if formula_1 is a direct sum of two subspaces formula_112 and formula_216, then formula_10 is a direct sum of formula_246 and formula_247.

=== Dimensional analysis ===
The dual space is analogous to a &quot;negative&quot;-dimensional space. Most simply, since a vector formula_196 can be paired with a covector formula_249 by the natural pairing
formula_250 to obtain a scalar, a covector can &quot;cancel&quot; the dimension of a vector, similar to reducing a fraction. Thus while the direct sum formula_251 is a -dimensional space (if is -dimensional), behaves as an -dimensional space, in the sense that its dimensions can be canceled against the dimensions of . This is formalized by tensor contraction.

This arises in physics via dimensional analysis, where the dual space has inverse units. Under the natural pairing, these units cancel, and the resulting scalar value is dimensionless, as expected. For example, in (continuous) Fourier analysis, or more broadly time–frequency analysis: given a one-dimensional vector space with a unit of time , the dual space has units of frequency: occurrences &quot;per&quot; unit of time (units of ). For example, if time is measured in seconds, the corresponding dual unit is the inverse second: over the course of 3 seconds, an event that occurs 2 times per second occurs a total of 6 times, corresponding to formula_252. Similarly, if the primal space measures length, the dual space measures inverse length.

== Continuous dual space ==

When dealing with topological vector spaces, the continuous linear functionals from the space into the base field formula_253 (or formula_254) are particularly important.
This gives rise to the notion of the &quot;continuous dual space&quot; or &quot;topological dual&quot; which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space formula_10, denoted by formula_7.
For any &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; normed vector space or topological vector space, such as Euclidean &quot;n-&quot;space, the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide.
This is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space, as shown by the example of discontinuous linear maps.
Nevertheless, in the theory of topological vector spaces the terms &quot;continuous dual space&quot; and &quot;topological dual space&quot; are often replaced by &quot;dual space&quot;.

For a topological vector space formula_1 its &quot;continuous dual space&quot;, or &quot;topological dual space&quot;, or just &quot;dual space&quot; (in the sense of the theory of topological vector spaces) formula_7 is defined as the space of all continuous linear functionals formula_259.

Important examples for continuous dual spaces are the space of compactly supported test functions formula_260 and its dual formula_261 the space of arbitrary distributions (generalized functions); the space of arbitrary test functions formula_262 and its dual formula_263 the space of compactly supported distributions; and the space of rapidly decreasing test functions formula_264 the Schwartz space, and its dual formula_265 the space of tempered distributions (slowly growing distributions) in the theory of generalized functions.

=== Properties ===

If is a Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS), then the continuous dual space of is identical to the continuous dual space of the completion of .

=== Topologies on the dual ===
There is a standard construction for introducing a topology on the continuous dual formula_7 of a topological vector space formula_1. Fix a collection formula_268 of bounded subsets of formula_1.
This gives the topology on formula_1 of uniform convergence on sets from formula_271 or what is the same thing, the topology generated by seminorms of the form

:formula_272

where formula_17 is a continuous linear functional on formula_1, and formula_112 runs over the class formula_276

This means that a net of functionals formula_277 tends to a functional formula_17 in formula_7 if and only if

:formula_280

Usually (but not necessarily) the class formula_268 is supposed to satisfy the following conditions:
* Each point formula_19 of formula_1 belongs to some set formula_284:
*:formula_285
* Each two sets formula_286 and formula_287 are contained in some set formula_288:
*:formula_289
* formula_268 is closed under the operation of multiplication by scalars: 
*:formula_291

If these requirements are fulfilled then the corresponding topology on formula_7 is Hausdorff and the sets

:formula_293

form its local base.

Here are the three most important special cases.
* The strong topology on formula_7 is the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets in formula_1 (so here formula_268 can be chosen as the class of all bounded subsets in formula_1).
If formula_1 is a normed vector space (for example, a Banach space or a Hilbert space) then the strong topology on formula_7 is normed (in fact a Banach space if the field of scalars is complete), with the norm
::formula_300
* The stereotype topology on formula_7 is the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in formula_1 (so here formula_268 can be chosen as the class of all totally bounded subsets in formula_1).
* The weak topology on formula_7 is the topology of uniform convergence on finite subsets in formula_1 (so here formula_268 can be chosen as the class of all finite subsets in formula_1).

Each of these three choices of topology on formula_7 leads to a variant of reflexivity property for topological vector spaces:
* If formula_7 is endowed with the strong topology, then the corresponding notion of reflexivity is the standard one: the spaces reflexive in this sense are just called &quot;reflexive&quot;.
* If formula_7 is endowed with the stereotype dual topology, then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of stereotype spaces: the spaces reflexive in this sense are called &quot;stereotype&quot;.
* If formula_7 is endowed with the weak topology, then the corresponding reflexivity is presented in the theory of dual pairs: the spaces reflexive in this sense are arbitrary (Hausdorff) locally convex spaces with the weak topology.

=== Examples ===

Let 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞ be a real number and consider the Banach space &quot;ℓ p&quot; of all sequences for which

:formula_313

Define the number &quot;q&quot; by . Then the continuous dual of &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; is naturally identified with &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;q&quot;: given an element formula_314, the corresponding element of is the sequence formula_315 where formula_316 denotes the sequence whose -th term is 1 and all others are zero. Conversely, given an element , the corresponding continuous linear functional &quot;formula_17&quot; on is defined by

:formula_318

for all (see Hölder&#x27;s inequality).

In a similar manner, the continuous dual of is naturally identified with (the space of bounded sequences).
Furthermore, the continuous duals of the Banach spaces &quot;c&quot; (consisting of all convergent sequences, with the supremum norm) and &quot;c&quot;0 (the sequences converging to zero) are both naturally identified with .

By the Riesz representation theorem, the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is anti-isomorphic to the original space.
This gives rise to the bra–ket notation used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

By the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem, the continuous dual of certain spaces of continuous functions can be described using measures.

=== Transpose of a continuous linear map ===
If is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces, then the (continuous) transpose is defined by the same formula as before:

:formula_319

The resulting functional is in . The assignment produces a linear map between the space of continuous linear maps from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; and the space of linear maps from to .
When &quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot; are composable continuous linear maps, then

:formula_320

When &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are normed spaces, the norm of the transpose in is equal to that of &quot;T&quot; in .
Several properties of transposition depend upon the Hahn–Banach theorem.
For example, the bounded linear map &quot;T&quot; has dense range if and only if the transpose is injective.

When &quot;T&quot; is a compact linear map between two Banach spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, then the transpose is compact.
This can be proved using the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem.

When &quot;V&quot; is a Hilbert space, there is an antilinear isomorphism &quot;iV&quot; from &quot;V&quot; onto its continuous dual .
For every bounded linear map &quot;T&quot; on &quot;V&quot;, the transpose and the adjoint operators are linked by

:formula_321

When &quot;T&quot; is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, then the transpose is continuous when and are equipped with &quot;compatible&quot; topologies: for example, when for and , both duals have the strong topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets of &quot;X&quot;, or both have the weak-∗ topology of pointwise convergence on &quot;X&quot;.
The transpose is continuous from to , or from to .

=== Annihilators ===

Assume that &quot;W&quot; is a closed linear subspace of a normed space &quot;V&quot;, and consider the annihilator of &quot;W&quot; in ,

:formula_322

Then, the dual of the quotient can be identified with &quot;W&quot;⊥, and the dual of &quot;W&quot; can be identified with the quotient .
Indeed, let &quot;P&quot; denote the canonical surjection from &quot;V&quot; onto the quotient ; then, the transpose is an isometric isomorphism from into , with range equal to &quot;W&quot;⊥.
If &quot;j&quot; denotes the injection map from &quot;W&quot; into &quot;V&quot;, then the kernel of the transpose is the annihilator of &quot;W&quot;:
:formula_323
and it follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem that induces an isometric isomorphism

=== Further properties ===

If the dual of a normed space is separable, then so is the space itself.
The converse is not true: for example, the space is separable, but its dual is not.

=== Double dual ===
In analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual, there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator from a normed space &quot;V&quot; into its continuous double dual , defined by

:formula_324

As a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem, this map is in fact an isometry, meaning for all .
Normed spaces for which the map Ψ is a bijection are called reflexive.

When &quot;V&quot; is a topological vector space then Ψ(&quot;x&quot;) can still be defined by the same formula, for every , however several difficulties arise.
First, when &quot;V&quot; is not locally convex, the continuous dual may be equal to { 0 } and the map Ψ trivial.
However, if &quot;V&quot; is Hausdorff and locally convex, the map Ψ is injective from &quot;V&quot; to the algebraic dual of the continuous dual, again as a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.

Second, even in the locally convex setting, several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual , so that the continuous double dual is not uniquely defined as a set. Saying that Ψ maps from &quot;V&quot; to , or in other words, that Ψ(&quot;x&quot;) is continuous on for every , is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of , namely that the evaluation mappings

: formula_325

be continuous for the chosen topology on . Further, there is still a choice of a topology on , and continuity of Ψ depends upon this choice.
As a consequence, defining reflexivity in this framework is more involved than in the normed case.

<text>Dianetics is a set of ideas and practices, invented in 1950 by science fiction writer L.Ron Hubbard, regarding the human mind. Dianetics was originally conceived as a form of psychological treatment, but was rejected by the psychological and medical establishments as pseudoscientific. It was the precursor to Scientology and has since been incorporated into it. It involves a process referred to as &quot;auditing&quot;, which utilizes an electrical resistance meter, ostensibly to remove emotional burdens and &quot;cure&quot; people from their troubles.

&quot;Auditing&quot; uses techniques from hypnosis that are intended to create dependency and obedience in the auditing subject. Hubbard eventually decided to present Dianetics as a form of spirituality that is part of the Church of Scientology, after several practitioners had been arrested for practicing medicine without a license, and a prosecution trial was pending against the first Dianetics organization that Hubbard founded in Elizabeth, New Jersey. As well as escaping prosecution, Hubbard also saw the possibility of reducing the tax burden from the sale of dianetics books and methods.

== Premise ==

The word &quot;Dianetics&quot; was coined from Greek &quot;dia&quot; meaning &quot;through&quot; and &quot;nous&quot; meaning &quot;mind&quot;.

Dianetics theory describes the human mind as two parts: the conscious &quot;analytical mind&quot; and the subconscious &quot;reactive mind&quot;. The stated purpose of Dianetics technique, called &quot;auditing&quot;, is to erase the contents of the reactive mind—the holder of painful and destructive emotions which can act on a person as posthypnotic suggestions. &quot;Auditing&quot; uses techniques from hypnosis which are intended to create dependency and obedience in the auditing subject. In auditing, the person is asked questions intended to help them locate and deal with painful past experiences.

Dianetics theory posits that &quot;the basic principle of existence is to survive&quot; and that the basic personality of humans is sincere, intelligent, and good. The drive for goodness and survival is distorted and inhibited by aberrations (deviations from rational thinking). Hubbard claimed that Dianetics could increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be psychosomatic. Conditions purportedly treatable with Dianetics included arthritis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, ulcers, migraine headaches, and sexual deviation.

==History==
According to Hubbard, when he was sedated for a dental operation in 1938, he had a near-death experience which inspired him to write the manuscript &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Though it was never published, this work would allegedly become the basis for Dianetics. The first publication on Dianetics was &quot;&quot;, an article by Hubbard in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (cover date May 1950). This was followed by the book &quot;&quot; (DMSMH) published May 9, 1950. In these works Hubbard claimed that the source of all psychological pain, and therefore the cause of mental and physical health problems, was a form of memory known as &quot;engrams&quot;. According to Hubbard, individuals could reach a state he named &quot;Clear&quot; when all of their engrams had been removed through talking with an &quot;auditor&quot;.

While the technique was not accepted by the medical and scientific establishment, in the first two years of its publication DMSMH sold over 100,000 copies. Publication of DMSMH brought in a flood of revenue, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. Two of the strongest initial supporters of Dianetics in the 1950s were John W. Campbell, editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and Joseph Augustus Winter, a writer and medical physician. Campbell published some of Hubbard&#x27;s short stories, and Winter hoped that his own colleagues would likewise be attracted to Hubbard&#x27;s Dianetics system.

Readers formed groups to study and practice Dianetics technique. According to sociologist Roy Wallis, this period was one of &quot;excited experimentation&quot; and Hubbard&#x27;s work was regarded as &quot;an initial exploration to be developed further by others&quot;. Per Wallis, it was Dianetics&#x27; popularity as a lay psychotherapy that contributed to the Dianetics Foundation&#x27;s downfall. Most people read the book, tried it out, then put it down. The remaining practitioners had no ties to the Foundation. Factions formed and followers challenged Hubbard&#x27;s movement and his authority. The craze of 1950–51 was dead by 1952.

In 1951, with debts piled up and facing bankruptcy, the Foundation was bailed out by Don Purcell, a wealthy Dianetics follower from Wichita. The relief was short-lived, however, and the Foundation fell to bankruptcy in 1952. Hubbard fled to Phoenix, Arizona, having lost the Foundation, the rights to Dianetics, and the DMSMH copyrights to Purcell. Hubbard sued and in 1954 Purcell settled by giving the copyrights back to Hubbard.

In Phoenix, Hubbard created &quot;Scientology&quot;; its techniques were intended to rehabilitate a person so that they might reach their full potential as a spiritual being. Dianetics was incorporated into Scientology. In 1978, Hubbard introduced &quot;New Era Dianetics&quot; (NED) and New Era Dianetics for OTs, and added them to The Bridge to Total Freedom.

== Concepts ==

In the book, &quot;&quot;, Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid individuals of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the &quot;analytical mind&quot; and the &quot;reactive mind&quot;. The &quot;reactive mind&quot;, the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the &quot;reactive mind&quot; are dubbed &quot;engrams&quot;. Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of clear.

In Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of &quot;mental image pictures&quot;, which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from pre-natal experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of unconsciousness involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an engram, and defined it as &quot;a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.&quot;

Hubbard proposed that these engrams caused &quot;aberrations&quot; (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind. In Hubbard&#x27;s earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as &quot;norn&quot;, &quot;impediment&quot;, and &quot;comanome&quot; before &quot;engram&quot; was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD. Some commentators noted Dianetics&#x27;s blend of science fiction and occult orientations at the time.

Hubbard claimed that these engrams were the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, &quot;Take him now&quot;, during the patient&#x27;s birth. 

According to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first psychotherapy to address traumatic experiences in their own time, but others had done so before as standard procedure. Hugh Urban wrote it was clear that Hubbard&#x27;s work had been influenced by Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Otto Rank, and Hubbard himself mentioned similarities between Dianetics and Freud.

Hubbard claimed that by using Dianetics technique the reactive mind could be emptied of all engrams; &quot;cleared&quot; of its contents. A person who has completed this process would be &quot;Clear&quot;. The benefits of Clear might include a higher IQ, better relationships, or career success.
== Procedure ==
The procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as &quot;auditing&quot;) is a two-person activity. One person, the &quot;auditor&quot;, guides the other person, the &quot;preclear&quot;, through the procedures. The preclear&#x27;s job is to look at their mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says and controls the process.

The auditor and preclear sit down facing each other. After getting settled, the auditor tells the preclear to close their eyes and locate something that happened to them in the past. The preclear tells the auditor what happened in the incident like he is re-experiencing it again. The auditor coaxes the preclear to recall as much as possible, and goes back over the incident several times until the preclear is cheerful about it, at which point the auditor may end the session or find another incident and repeat the process.

==Therapeutic claims==

In August 1950, amidst the success of &quot;&quot;, Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles&#x27; Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as &quot;the world&#x27;s first Clear&quot;. Despite Hubbard&#x27;s claim that she had &quot;full and perfect recall of every moment of her life&quot;, Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard&#x27;s tie. Hubbard explained Bianca&#x27;s failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word &quot;now&quot; in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in &quot;present time&quot;, which blocked her abilities. Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world&#x27;s first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working &quot;incognito&quot; in Hollywood posing as a swami. In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.

Hubbard claimed, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in November 1950, that &quot;he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations.&quot; He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail. In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of Elizabeth, New Jersey, published &quot;Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results&quot;, a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of X-ray plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured &quot;aberrations&quot; including manic depression, asthma, arthritis, colitis and &quot;overt homosexuality&quot;, and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report&#x27;s subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (&quot;Case 1080A, R. L.&quot;).

The authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard&#x27;s book &quot;Science of Survival&quot; (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any scientific controls. Winter was originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, but by the end of 1950 had cut ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as &quot;absolutistic and authoritarian&quot;, and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake &quot;precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind&quot;. He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other. Hubbard writes: &quot;Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.&quot;

==Scientific rejection==

Hubbard&#x27;s original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The American Psychological Association passed a resolution in 1950 calling &quot;attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.&quot; Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a scientific theory, and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a pseudoscience.

Few scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor John A. Lee states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:

The MEDLINE database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of New York University. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetic therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not affect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts; Jack Fox tested Hubbard&#x27;s thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.

Commentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, philosophy professor Robert Carroll points to Dianetics&#x27; lack of empirical evidence:

The validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer Martin Gardner asserts that &quot;nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.&quot;

Other critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of hypnosis. Hubbard, who had previously used hypnosis for entertainment purposes, strongly denied this connection and cautioned against hypnosis in Dianetics auditing. Professor Richard J. Ofshe, a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclear at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic suggestion. Other researchers have identified quotations in Hubbard&#x27;s work suggesting evidence that false memories were created in &quot;Dianetics&quot;, specifically in the form of birth and pre-birth memories.

According to an article by physician Martin Gumpert, &quot;Hubbard&#x27;s concept of psychosomatic disease is definitely wrong. Psychosomatic ailments are not simply caused by emotional disturbances: they are diseases in which the emotional and the organic factor are closely involved and interdependent.&quot;

<text>In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is a core component of business intelligence. Data warehouses are central repositories of data integrated from disparate sources. They store current and historical data organized in a way that is optimized for data analysis, generation of reports, and developing insights across the integrated data. They are intended to be used by analysts and managers to help make organizational decisions.
The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting. 

The two main workflows for building a data warehouse system are extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT).

== Components ==
The environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:

* Source systems of data (often, the company&#x27;s operational databases, such as relational databases);
* Data integration technology and processes to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse;
* Architectures to store data in the warehouse or marts;
* Tools and applications for varied users;
* Metadata, data quality, and governance processes. Metadata includes data sources (database, table, and column names), refresh schedules and data usage measures.

== Related systems ==

=== Operational databases ===
Operational databases are optimized for the preservation of data integrity and speed of recording of business transactions through use of database normalization and an entity–relationship model. Operational system designers generally follow Codd&#x27;s 12 rules of database normalization to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. Relational databases are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected by each transaction. To improve performance, older data are periodically purged.

Data warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns, which usually involve selecting specific fields rather than all fields as is common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented database management system (DBMS), whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a column-oriented DBMS. Operational systems maintain a snapshot of the business, while warehouses maintain historic data through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems to the warehouse.

Online analytical processing (OLAP) is characterized by a low rate of transactions and complex queries that involve aggregations. Response time is an effective performance measure of OLAP systems. OLAP applications are widely used for data mining. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually star schemas). OLAP systems typically have a data latency of a few hours, while data mart latency is closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are roll-up (consolidation), drill-down, and slicing &amp; dicing.

Online transaction processing (OLTP) is characterized by a large numbers of short online transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, performance is the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually 3NF). Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.

Predictive analytics is about finding and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models to prepare for different future outcomes, including demand for products, and make better decisions. By contrast, OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive. Predictive systems are also used for customer relationship management (CRM).

=== Data marts ===
A data mart is a simple data warehouse focused on a single subject or functional area. Hence it draws data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department in an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data. As with warehouses, stored data is usually not normalized.

Types of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.

==Variants==
===ETL===
The typical extract, transform, load (ETL)-based data warehouse uses staging, data integration, and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer, often storing this transformed data in an operational data store (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema. The access layer helps users retrieve data.

The main source of the data is cleansed, transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing, market research and decision support. However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition of data warehousing includes business intelligence tools, tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve metadata.

===ELT===
ELT-based data warehousing gets rid of a separate ETL tool for data transformation. Instead, it maintains a staging area inside the data warehouse itself. In this approach, data gets extracted from heterogeneous source systems and are then directly loaded into the data warehouse, before any transformation occurs. All necessary transformations are then handled inside the data warehouse itself. Finally, the manipulated data gets loaded into target tables in the same data warehouse.

==Benefits==
A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
* Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an operational data store.
* Mitigate the problem of isolation-level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by long-running analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
* Maintain data history, even if the source transaction systems do not.
* Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization grows via merging.
* Improve data quality, by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
* Present the organization&#x27;s information consistently.
* Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of data source.
* Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
* Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the operational systems.
* Add value to operational business applications, notably customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
* Make decision–support queries easier to write.
* Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.

==History==
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the &quot;business data warehouse&quot;. In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision support environments. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as legacy systems), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from &quot;data marts&quot; that was tailored for ready access by users.

Additionally, with the publication of The IRM Imperative (Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991) by James M. Kerr, the idea of managing and putting a dollar value on an organization&#x27;s data resources and then reporting that value as an asset on a balance sheet became popular. In the book, Kerr described a way to populate subject-area databases from data derived from transaction-driven systems to create a storage area where summary data could be further leveraged to inform executive decision-making. This concept served to promote further thinking of how a data warehouse could be developed and managed in a practical way within any enterprise.

Key developments in early years of data warehousing:

* 1960s – General Mills and Dartmouth College, in a joint research project, develop the terms &quot;dimensions&quot; and &quot;facts&quot;.
* 1970s – ACNielsen and IRI provide dimensional data marts for retail sales.
* 1970s – Bill Inmon begins to define and discuss the term Data Warehouse.
* 1975 – Sperry Univac introduces MAPPER (MAintain, Prepare, and Produce Executive Reports), a database management and reporting system that includes the world&#x27;s first 4GL. It is the first platform designed for building Information Centers (a forerunner of contemporary data warehouse technology).
* 1983 – Teradata introduces the DBC/1012 database computer specifically designed for decision support.
* 1984 – Metaphor Computer Systems, founded by David Liddle and Don Massaro, releases a hardware/software package and GUI for business users to create a database management and analytic system.
* 1988 – Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy publish the article &quot;An architecture for a business and information system&quot; where they introduce the term &quot;business data warehouse&quot;.
* 1990 – Red Brick Systems, founded by Ralph Kimball, introduces Red Brick Warehouse, a database management system specifically for data warehousing.
* 1991 – James M. Kerr authors The IRM Imperative, which suggests data resources could be reported as an asset on a balance sheet, furthering commercial interest in the establishment of data warehouses.
* 1991 – Prism Solutions, founded by Bill Inmon, introduces Prism Warehouse Manager, software for developing a data warehouse.
* 1992 – Bill Inmon publishes the book &quot;Building the Data Warehouse&quot;.
* 1995 – The Data Warehousing Institute, a for-profit organization that promotes data warehousing, is founded.
* 1996 – Ralph Kimball publishes the book &quot;The Data Warehouse Toolkit&quot;.
* 1998 – Focal modeling is implemented as an ensemble (hybrid) data warehouse modeling approach, with Patrik Lager as one of the main drivers.
* 2000 – Dan Linstedt releases in the public domain the Data vault modeling, conceived in 1990 as an alternative to Inmon and Kimball to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems, with emphasis on tracing, auditing and resilience to change of the source data model.
* 2008 – Bill Inmon, along with Derek Strauss and Genia Neushloss, publishes &quot;DW 2.0: The Architecture for the Next Generation of Data Warehousing&quot;, explaining his top-down approach to data warehousing and coining the term, data-warehousing 2.0.
* 2008 – Anchor modeling was formalized in a paper presented at the International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, and won the best paper award
* 2012 – Bill Inmon develops and makes public technology known as &quot;textual disambiguation&quot;. Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL. Textual disambiguation is useful wherever raw text is found, such as in documents, Hadoop, email, and so forth.
* 2013 – Data vault 2.0 was released, having some minor changes to the modeling method, as well as integration with best practices from other methodologies, architectures and implementations including agile and CMMI principles

==Data organization==

===Facts===
A fact is a value or measurement in the system being managed.

Raw facts are ones reported by the reporting entity. For example, in a mobile telephone system, if a base transceiver station (BTS) receives 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, allocates for 820, and rejects the rest, it could report three facts to a management system:
* 

Raw facts are aggregated to higher levels in various dimensions to extract information more relevant to the service or business. These are called aggregated facts or summaries.

For example, if there are three BTSs in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated to the city level in the network dimension. For example:
* 

===Dimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data===
The two most important approaches to store data in a warehouse are dimensional and normalized. The dimensional approach uses a star schema as proposed by Ralph Kimball. The normalized approach, also called the third normal form (3NF) is an entity-relational normalized model proposed by Bill Inmon.

====Dimensional approach====
In a dimensional approach, transaction data is partitioned into &quot;facts&quot;, which are usually numeric transaction data, and &quot;dimensions&quot;, which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.

This dimensional approach makes data easier to understand and speeds up data retrieval. Dimensional structures are easy for business users to understand because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization&#x27;s business processes and operational system, and dimensions are the context about them (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage is that the dimensional model does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.

The model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as a data cube, where dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.

The main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are:
# It is complicated to maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems
# It is difficult to modify the warehouse structure if the organization changes the way it does business.

====Normalized approach====
In the normalized approach, the data in the warehouse are stored following, to a degree, database normalization rules. Normalized relational database tables are grouped into &quot;subject areas&quot; (for example, customers, products and finance). When used in large enterprises, the result is dozens of tables linked by a web of joins.(Kimball, Ralph 2008).

The main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Disadvantages include that, because of the large number of tables, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and access the information without a precise understanding of the date sources and the data structure of the data warehouse.

Both normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity–relationship diagrams because both contain joined relational tables. The difference between them is the degree of normalization. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).

In &quot;Information-Driven Business&quot;, Robert Hillard compares the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. He concludes that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of information entropy and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.

==Design methods==
===Bottom-up design===
In the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, data marts are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific business processes. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of &quot;the bus&quot;, a collection of conformed dimensions and conformed facts, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.

===Top-down design===
The &quot;top-down&quot; approach is designed using a normalized enterprise data model. &quot;Atomic&quot; data, that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.

===Hybrid design===
Data warehouses often resemble the hub and spokes architecture. Legacy systems feeding the warehouse often include customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning, generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the extract transform load process, data warehouses often make use of an operational data store, the information from which is parsed into the actual data warehouse. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.

A hybrid (also called ensemble) data warehouse database is kept on third normal form to eliminate data redundancy. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The data warehouse provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a data warehouse to be replaced with a master data management repository where operational (not static) information could reside.

The data vault modeling components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and star schema. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which, when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema-based release area for business purposes.

==Characteristics==
There are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.

===Subject-oriented===
Unlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around the subjects of the enterprise. Subject orientation is not database normalization. Subject orientation can be really useful for decision-making.
Gathering the required objects is called subject-oriented.

===Integrated===
The data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.

===Time-variant===
While operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores mostly historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting. (E.g. if a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.)

===Nonvolatile===
The data in the data warehouse is read-only, which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted (unless there is a regulatory or statutory obligation to do so).

==Options==
===Aggregation===
In the data warehouse process, data can be aggregated in data marts at different levels of abstraction. The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and drills down to lower levels of details.
===Virtualization===
With data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources creating a virtual data warehouse. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach.

==Architecture==
The different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine-tuned.

==Evolution in organization use==
These terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:

; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this stage of evolution are updated on a regular time cycle (usually daily, weekly or monthly) from the operational systems and the data is stored in an integrated reporting-oriented database.
; Offline data warehouse: Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.
; On-time data warehouse: Online Integrated Data Warehousing represent the real-time Data warehouses stage data in the warehouse is updated for every transaction performed on the source data
; Integrated data warehouse: These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.

<text>The Devonian ( ) is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic era during the Phanerozoic eon, spanning 60.3 million years from the end of the preceding Silurian period at million years ago (Ma), to the beginning of the succeeding Carboniferous period at Ma. It is the fourth period of both the Paleozoic and the Phanerozoic. It is named after Devon, South West England, where rocks from this period were first studied.

The first significant evolutionary radiation of life on land occurred during the Devonian, as free-sporing land plants (pteridophytes) began to spread across dry land, forming extensive coal forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of vascular plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants (pteridospermatophytes) appeared. This rapid evolution and colonization process, which had begun during the Silurian, is known as the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution. The earliest land animals, predominantly arthropods such as myriapods, arachnids and hexapods, also became well-established early in this period, after beginning their colonization of land at least from the Ordovician period.

Fishes, especially jawed fish, reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to be called the Age of Fishes. The armored placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. In the oceans, cartilaginous fishes such as primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and Late Ordovician. Tetrapodomorphs, which include the ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates (i.e. tetrapods), began diverging from freshwater lobe-finned fish as their more robust and muscled pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into forelimbs and hindlimbs, though they were not fully established for life on land until the Late Carboniferous.

The first ammonites, a subclass of cephalopod molluscs, appeared. Trilobites, brachiopods and the great coral reefs were still common during the Devonian. The Late Devonian extinction, which started about 375 Ma, severely affected marine life, killing off most of the reef systems, most of the jawless fish, the placoderms, and nearly all trilobites save for a few species of the order Proetida. The subsequent end-Devonian extinction, which occurred at around 359 Ma, further impacted the ecosystems and completed the extinction of all calcite sponge reefs and placoderms.

Devonian palaeogeography was dominated by the supercontinent Gondwana to the south, the small continent of Siberia to the north, and the medium-sized continent of Laurussia to the east. Major tectonic events include the closure of the Rheic Ocean, the separation of South China from Gondwana, and the resulting expansion of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The Devonian experienced several major mountain-building events as Laurussia and Gondwana approached; these include the Acadian Orogeny in North America and the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny in Europe. These early collisions preceded the formation of the single supercontinent Pangaea in the Late Paleozoic.

==History ==

The period is named after Devon, a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found throughout the county was resolved by adding the Devonian Period to the geological timescale. The Great Devonian Controversy was a lengthy debate between Roderick Murchison, Adam Sedgwick and Henry De la Beche over the naming of the period. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named it the Devonian System.

While the rock beds that define the start and end of the Devonian Period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian Ma, to the beginning of the Carboniferous Ma – in North America, at the beginning of the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous.

In 19th-century texts, the Devonian has been called the &quot;Old Red Age&quot;, after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the Old Red Sandstone in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is &quot;Age of the Fishes&quot;, referring to the evolution of several major groups of fish that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian, and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.

The Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a &quot;greenhouse age&quot;, due to sampling bias: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the strata of Western Europe and eastern North America, which at the time straddled the Equator as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where fossil signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical climates that were warm and moderately humid. In fact, the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its epochs and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and South America had a warm temperate climate. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and temperate climates were more common.

==Subdivisions==
The Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.

;Early Devonian
The Early Devonian lasted from to Ma. It began with the Lochkovian Stage from to Ma, which was followed by the Pragian from to Ma and then by the Emsian, which lasted until the Middle Devonian began at Ma.
During this time, the first ammonoids appeared, descending from bactritoid nautiloids. Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order Agoniatitida, which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example Goniatitida and Clymeniida. This class of cephalopod molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the Mesozoic Era.

;Middle Devonian
The Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the Eifelian, which then gave way to the Givetian at Ma. During this time, the jawless agnathan fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation, and diversity of jawed fishes. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.

;Late Devonian

Finally, the Late Devonian started with the Frasnian, from to Ma, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing Famennian subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian at Ma.

==Climate==
The Devonian was a relatively warm period, although significant glaciers may have existed during the Early and Middle Devonian. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest. Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from conodont apatite implies an average value of in the Early Devonian. Early Devonian mean annual surface temperatures were approximately 16 °C. levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian Period. The newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere, which were then buried into sediments. This may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around . The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming. The climate would have affected the dominant organisms in reefs; microbes would have been the main reef-forming organisms in warm periods, with corals and stromatoporoid sponges taking the dominant role in cooler times. The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids. At the terminus of the Devonian, Earth rapidly cooled into an icehouse, marking the beginning of the Late Paleozoic icehouse.

==Paleogeography==
The Devonian world involved many continents and ocean basins of various sizes. The largest continent, Gondwana, was located entirely within the Southern Hemisphere. It corresponds to modern day South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and India, as well as minor components of North America and Asia. The second-largest continent, Laurussia, was northwest of Gondwana, and corresponds to much of modern-day North America and Europe. Various smaller continents, microcontinents, and terranes were present east of Laurussia and north of Gondwana, corresponding to parts of Europe and Asia. The Devonian Period was a time of great tectonic activity, as the major continents of Laurussia and Gondwana drew closer together.

Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical reef organisms lived. The enormous &quot;world ocean&quot;, Panthalassa, occupied much of the Northern Hemisphere as well as wide swathes east of Gondwana and west of Laurussia. Other minor oceans were the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and Rheic Ocean.

=== Laurussia ===

By the early Devonian, the continent Laurussia (also known as Euramerica) was fully formed through the collision of the continents Laurentia (modern day North America) and Baltica (modern day northern and eastern Europe). The tectonic effects of this collision continued into the Devonian, producing a string of mountain ranges along the southeastern coast of the continent. In present-day eastern North America, the Acadian Orogeny continued to raise the Appalachian Mountains. Further east, the collision also extended the rise of the Caledonian Mountains of Great Britain and Scandinavia. As the Caledonian Orogeny wound down in the later part of the period, orogenic collapse facilitated a cluster of granite intrusions in Scotland.

Most of Laurussia was located south of the equator, but in the Devonian it moved northwards and began to rotate counterclockwise towards its modern position. While the most northern parts of the continent (such as Greenland and Ellesmere Island) established tropical conditions, most of the continent was located within the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn, which (as nowadays) is a result of the convergence of two great air-masses, the Hadley cell and the Ferrel cell. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidised iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. The abundance of red sandstone on continental land also lends Laurussia the name &quot;the Old Red Continent&quot;. For much of the Devonian, the majority of western Laurussia (North America) was covered by subtropical inland seas which hosted a diverse ecosystem of reefs and marine life. Devonian marine deposits are particularly prevalent in the midwestern and northeastern United States. Devonian reefs also extended along the southeast edge of Laurussia, a coastline now corresponding to southern England, Belgium, and other mid-latitude areas of Europe.

In the Early and Middle Devonian, the west coast of Laurussia was a passive margin with broad coastal waters, deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in Idaho and Nevada. In the Late Devonian, an approaching volcanic island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf and began to uplift deep water deposits. This minor collision sparked the start of a mountain-building episode called the Antler orogeny, which extended into the Carboniferous. Mountain building could also be found in the far northeastern extent of the continent, as minor tropical island arcs and detached Baltic terranes re-join the continent. Deformed remnants of these mountains can still be found on Ellesmere Island and Svalbard. Many of the Devonian collisions in Laurussia produce both mountain chains and foreland basins, which are frequently fossiliferous.

=== Gondwana ===

Gondwana was by far the largest continent on the planet. It was completely south of the equator, although the northeastern sector (now Australia) did reach tropical latitudes. The southwestern sector (now South America) was located to the far south, with Brazil situated near the South Pole. The northwestern edge of Gondwana was an active margin for much of the Devonian, and saw the accretion of many smaller land masses and island arcs. These include Chilenia, Cuyania, and Chaitenia, which now form much of Chile and Patagonia. These collisions were associated with volcanic activity and plutons, but by the Late Devonian the tectonic situation had relaxed and much of South America was covered by shallow seas. These south polar seas hosted a distinctive brachiopod fauna, the Malvinokaffric Realm, which extended eastward to marginal areas now equivalent to South Africa and Antarctica. Malvinokaffric faunas even managed to approach the South Pole via a tongue of Panthalassa which extended into the Paraná Basin.

The northern rim of Gondwana was mostly a passive margin, hosting extensive marine deposits in areas such as northwest Africa and Tibet. The eastern margin, though warmer than the west, was equally active. Numerous mountain building events and granite and kimberlite intrusions affected areas equivalent to modern day eastern Australia, Tasmania, and Antarctica.

=== Asian terranes ===
Several island microcontinents (which would later coalesce into modern day Asia) stretched over a low-latitude archipelago to the north of Gondwana. They were separated from the southern continent by an oceanic basin: the Paleo-Tethys. Although the western Paleo-Tethys Ocean had existed since the Cambrian, the eastern part only began to rift apart as late as the Silurian. This process accelerated in the Devonian. The eastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys was fully opened when South China and Annamia (a terrane equivalent to most of Indochina), together as a unified continent, detached from the northeastern sector of Gondwana. Nevertheless, they remained close enough to Gondwana that their Devonian fossils were more closely related to Australian species than to north Asian species. Other Asian terranes remained attached to Gondwana, including Sibumasu (western Indochina), Tibet, and the rest of the Cimmerian blocks.

While the South China-Annamia continent was the newest addition to the Asian microcontinents, it was not the first. North China and the Tarim Block (now northwesternmost China) were located westward and continued to drift northwards, powering over older oceanic crust in the process. Further west was a small ocean (the Turkestan Ocean), followed by the larger microcontinents of Kazakhstania, Siberia, and Amuria. Kazakhstania was a volcanically active region during the Devonian, as it continued to assimilate smaller island arcs. The island arcs of the region, such as the Balkhash-West Junggar Arc, exhibited biological endemism as a consequence of their location.

Siberia was located just north of the equator as the largest landmass in the Northern Hemisphere. At the beginning of the Devonian, Siberia was inverted (upside down) relative to its modern orientation. Later in the period it moved northwards and began to twist clockwise, though it was not near its modern location. Siberia approached the eastern edge of Laurussia as the Devonian progressed, but it was still separated by a seaway, the Ural Ocean. Although Siberia&#x27;s margins were generally tectonically stable and ecologically productive, rifting and deep mantle plumes impacted the continent with flood basalts during the Late Devonian. The Altai-Sayan region was shaken by volcanism in the Early and Middle Devonian, while Late Devonian magmatism was magnified further to produce the Vilyuy Traps, flood basalts which may have contributed to the Late Devonian Mass Extinction. The last major round of volcanism, the Yakutsk Large Igneous Province, continued into the Carboniferous to produce extensive kimberlite deposits.

Similar volcanic activity also affected the nearby microcontinent of Amuria (now Manchuria, Mongolia and their vicinities). Though certainly close to Siberia in the Devonian, the precise location of Amuria is uncertain due to contradictory paleomagnetic data.

=== Closure of the Rheic Ocean ===
The Rheic Ocean, which separated Laurussia from Gondwana, was wide at the start of the Devonian, having formed after the drift of Avalonia away from Gondwana. It steadily shrunk as the period continued, as the two major continents approached near the equator in the early stages of the assembly of Pangaea. The closure of the Rheic Ocean began in the Devonian and continued into the Carboniferous. As the ocean narrowed, endemic marine faunas of Gondwana and Laurussia combined into a single tropical fauna. The history of the western Rheic Ocean is a subject of debate, but there is good evidence that Rheic oceanic crust experienced intense subduction and metamorphism under Mexico and Central America.

The closure of the eastern part of the Rheic Ocean is associated with the assemblage of central and southern Europe. In the early Paleozoic, much of Europe was still attached to Gondwana, including the terranes of Iberia, Armorica (France), Palaeo-Adria (the western Mediterranean area), Bohemia, Franconia, and Saxothuringia. These continental blocks, collectively known as the Armorican Terrane Assemblage, split away from Gondwana in the Silurian and drifted towards Laurussia through the Devonian. Their collision with Laurussia leads to the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny, a major mountain-building event which would escalate further in the Late Paleozoic. Franconia and Saxothuringia collided with Laurussia near the end of the Early Devonian, pinching out the easternmost Rheic Ocean. The rest of the Armorican terranes followed, and by the end of the Devonian they were fully connected with Laurussia. This sequence of rifting and collision events led to the successive creation and destruction of several small seaways, including the Rheno-Hercynian, Saxo-Thuringian, and Galicia-Moldanubian oceans. Their sediments were eventually compressed and completely buried as Gondwana fully collided with Laurussia in the Carboniferous.

==Life==

===Marine biota===

Sea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by conodonts, bryozoans, diverse and abundant brachiopods, the enigmatic hederellids, microconchids, and corals. Lily-like crinoids (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and trilobites were still fairly common. Bivalves became commonplace in deep water and outer shelf environments. The first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400  Ma. Bactritoids make their first appearance in the Early Devonian as well; their radiation, along with that of ammonoids, has been attributed by some authors to increased environmental stress resulting from decreasing oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the water column. Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish (ostracoderms) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water. Armored placoderms were numerous during the early ages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Osteichthyes) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of cartilaginous fish, &quot;Cladoselache&quot;, appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name &quot;The Age of Fishes&quot; in popular culture.

The Devonian saw significant expansion in the diversity of nektonic marine life driven by the abundance of planktonic microorganisms in the free water column as well as high ecological competition in benthic habitats, which were extremely saturated; this diversification has been labeled the &quot;Devonian Nekton Revolution&quot; by many researchers. However, other researchers have questioned whether this revolution existed at all; a 2018 study found that although the proportion of biodiversity constituted by nekton increased across the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian, it decreased across the span of the Devonian, particularly during the Pragian, and that the overall diversity of nektonic taxa did not increase significantly during the Devonian compared to during other geologic periods, and was in fact higher during the intervals spanning from the Wenlock to the Lochkovian and from the Carboniferous to the Permian. The study&#x27;s authors instead attribute the increased overall diversity of nekton in the Devonian to a broader, gradual trend of nektonic diversification across the entire Palaeozoic.

===Reefs===
A now-dry barrier reef, located in present-day Kimberley Basin of northwest Australia, once extended , fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs are generally built by various carbonate-secreting organisms that can erect wave-resistant structures near sea level. Although modern reefs are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous algae, Devonian reefs were either microbial reefs built up mostly by autotrophic cyanobacteria or coral-stromatoporoid reefs built up by coral-like stromatoporoids and tabulate and rugose corals. Microbial reefs dominated under the warmer conditions of the early and late Devonian, while coral-stromatoporoid reefs dominated during the cooler middle Devonian.

===Terrestrial biota===

By the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The moss forests and bacterial and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable soils and harbored arthropods like mites, scorpions, trigonotarbids and myriapods (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian and the existence of fossils such as &quot;Protichnites&quot; suggest that amphibious arthropods may have appeared as early as the Cambrian). By far the largest land organism at the beginning of this period was the enigmatic &quot;Prototaxites&quot;, which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation during the early part of the Devonian. Also, the first possible fossils of insects appeared around 416  Ma, in the Early Devonian. Evidence for the earliest tetrapods takes the form of trace fossils in shallow lagoon environments within a marine carbonate platform/shelf during the Middle Devonian, although these traces have been questioned and an interpretation as fish feeding traces (&quot;Piscichnus&quot;) has been advanced.

====The greening of land====
Many Early Devonian plants did not have true roots or leaves like extant plants, although vascular tissue is observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as &quot;Drepanophycus&quot; likely spread by vegetative growth and spores. The earliest land plants such as &quot;Cooksonia&quot; consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes with terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimetres tall. Fossils of &quot;Armoricaphyton chateaupannense&quot;, about 400 million years old, represent the oldest known plants with woody tissue. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest-known trees appeared in the Middle Devonian. These included a lineage of lycopods and another arborescent, woody vascular plant, the cladoxylopsids and progymnosperm &quot;Archaeopteris&quot;. These tracheophytes were able to grow to large size on dry land because they had evolved the ability to biosynthesize lignin, which gave them physical rigidity and improved the effectiveness of their vascular system while giving them resistance to pathogens and herbivores. In Eifelian age, cladoxylopsid trees formed the first forests in Earth history. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of many plant groups and growth forms has been referred to as the Devonian Explosion or the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution.

The &#x27;greening&#x27; of the continents acted as a carbon sink, and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event. (&quot;See&quot; Late Devonian extinction).

====Animals and the first soils====
Primitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed plants that characterized a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian Epoch. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first vertebrates to seek terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.

==Late Devonian extinction==

The Late Devonian extinction is not a single event, but rather is a series of pulsed extinctions at the Givetian-Frasnian boundary, the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, and the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. Together, these are considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; mass extinctions in Earth&#x27;s history. The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems.

Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, and acritarchs, and the world saw the disappearance of an estimated 96% of vertebrates like conodonts and bony fishes, and all of the ostracoderms and placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods).

The reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative. Canadian paleontologist Digby McLaren suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the Alamo bolide impact), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.

<text>David Thompson (30 April 1770 – 10 February 1857) was an Anglo-Canadian fur trader, surveyor, and cartographer, known to some native people as &quot;Koo-Koo-Sint&quot; or &quot;the Stargazer&quot;. Over Thompson&#x27;s career, he travelled across North America, mapping of the continent along the way. For this historic feat, Thompson has been described as the &quot;greatest practical land geographer that the world has produced&quot;.

==Early life==
David Thompson was born in Westminster, Middlesex, to recent Welsh migrants David and Ann Thompson. When Thompson was two, his father died. Due to his widowed mother not having financial resources, she placed Thompson, 29 April 1777, the day before his seventh birthday, and his older brother in the Grey Coat Hospital, a school for the disadvantaged of Westminster. Thompson graduated to the Grey Coat mathematical school, well known for teaching navigation and surveying.

He received an education for the Royal Navy: including mathematics of trigonometry and geometry, practical navigation including using of nautical instruments, finding latitudes and longitudes and making navigational calculations from observing the sun, moon and tide, and drawing maps and charts, taking land measurements, and sketching landscapes. He later built on these skills to make his career. In 1784, when Thompson was 14, the Grey Coat treasurer paid the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company the sum of five pounds, upon which the youth became an apprentice employee of the company, contracted for a period of seven years to be trained as a clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson/Moreau p.xxiii&quot;&gt;Thompson/Moreau p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

He set sail on a ship to North America on 28 May of that year, leaving England.

==Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC)==
On 2 September 1784, Thompson arrived in Churchill (now in Manitoba) and was put to work as a clerk/secretary, copying the personal papers of the governor of Fort Churchill, Samuel Hearne. The next year he was transferred to nearby York Factory, and over the next few years spent time as a secretary at Cumberland House, and South Branch House of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company before being transferred to Manchester House in 1787. During those years he learned to keep accounts and other records, calculate values of furs (it was noted that he also had several expensive beaver pelts at that time even when a secretary&#x27;s job would not pay terribly well), track supplies and other duties.

On 23 December 1788, Thompson seriously fractured his tibia, forcing him to spend the next two winters at Cumberland House convalescing. It was during this time that he greatly refined and expanded his mathematical, astronomical, and surveying skills under the tutelage of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company surveyor Philip Turnor. It was also during this time that he lost sight in his right eye.

In 1790, with his apprenticeship nearing its end, Thompson requested a set of surveying tools in place of the typical parting gift of fine clothes offered by the company to those completing their indenture. He received both. He entered the employ of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as a fur trader. In 1792 he completed his first significant survey, mapping a route to Lake Athabasca (where today&#x27;s Alberta/Saskatchewan border is located).

Between February and May 1793, Thompson made 34 observations of the longitude of Cumberland House using lunar distances. The mean of these observations was 102°12′ W, about 2&#x27; east of the modern value. The mean error of the 34 observations was about 15&#x27; of longitude. Broughton (2009) notes that the precision of the type of sextant used by Thompson was 15&quot; of arc, corresponding to 7.5&#x27; of longitude giving an absolute limit to the precision of an individual observation. The error in Thompson&#x27;s mean was several times less than this. The time he took on these observations, about 3 hours of calculation each, indicates that he understood the power of averages.

In recognition of his map-making and surveying skills, the company promoted Thompson to the surveyor in 1794. He continued working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company until 23 May 1797 when, frustrated by an order to cease surveying and focus on the fur trade, he left. He walked in the snow in order to enter the employ of the competition, the North West Company. There he continued to work as a fur trader and surveyor.

==North West Company ==
Thompson&#x27;s decision to defect to the North West Company (NWC) in 1797 without providing the customary one-year notice was not well received by his former employers. But the North West Company was more supportive of Thompson pursuing his work on surveying and mapping the interior of what was to become Canada, as they judged it in the company&#x27;s interest to know the exact locations of their settlements and the distances between them. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-US boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty of 1794 between Great Britain and the United States after the American Revolutionary War.

By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior. In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (Lac La Biche in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. (The English translation of Lac la Biche: Red Deer Lake, was first recorded on the Mackenzie map of 1793.) Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains.

On 10 July 1804, at the annual meeting of the North West Company in Kaministiquia, Thompson was made a full partner of the company. He became a &#x27;wintering partner&#x27;, who was based in the field rather than Montreal, and was granted two of the 92 NWC&#x27;s shares worth more than £4,000. He spent the next few seasons based there managing the fur trading operations, but still finding time to expand his surveys of the waterways around Lake Superior. At the 1806 company meeting, officers decided to send Thompson back into the interior. Concern over the United States-backed expedition of Lewis and Clark prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the Pacific to open up the lucrative trading territories of the Pacific Northwest.

==Columbia River travels==
After the general meeting in 1806, Thompson travelled to Rocky Mountain House and prepared for an expedition to follow the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. In June 1807 Thompson crossed the Rocky Mountains and spent the summer surveying the Columbia basin; he continued to survey the area over the next few seasons. Thompson mapped and established trading posts in Northwestern Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Western Canada. Trading posts he founded included Kootenae House, Kullyspell House and Saleesh House; the latter two were the first trading posts west of the Rockies in Idaho and Montana, respectively. These posts established by Thompson extended North West Company fur trading territory into the Columbia Basin drainage area. The maps he made of the Columbia River basin east of the Cascade Mountains were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be useful into the 20th-century.

In early 1810, Thompson was returning eastward toward Montreal but, while en route at Rainy Lake, received orders to return to the Rocky Mountains and establish a route to the mouth of the Columbia. The North West Company was responding to the plans of American entrepreneur John Jacob Astor to send a ship around the Americas to establish a fur trading post of the Pacific Fur Company on the Pacific Coast. During his return, Thompson was delayed by an angry group of Peigan natives at Howse Pass. He was ultimately forced to seek a new route across the Rocky Mountains and found one through the Athabasca Pass.

David Thompson was the first European to navigate the full length of the Columbia River. Between Kettle Falls (3 July 1811) and the Junction of the Columbia and Snake Rivers (9 July), he was travelling through country that had never been visited by Europeans, and took time to visit the villages along the way to establish good relations, helped by copious quantities of tobacco. In 1805 Lewis and Clark had descended the Snake River, and continued down the Columbia. On reaching the junction Thompson erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site. This notice was found later that year by Astor company workers looking to establish an inland fur post, contributing to their selection of a more northerly site at Fort Okanogan. The North West Company established its post of Fort Nez Percés near the Snake River confluence several years later. Continuing down the Columbia, Thompson passed over the Celilo Falls, almost losing the canoe on the rocks, and portaged around the rapids of The Dalles and the Cascades Rapids. On 14 July 1811, Thompson reached the partially constructed Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia, arriving two months after the Pacific Fur Company&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Tonquin&quot;.

Before returning upriver and across the mountains, Thompson hired Naukane, a Native Hawaiian Takane labourer brought to Fort Astoria by the Pacific Fur Company&#x27;s ship &quot;Tonquin&quot;. Naukane, known as Coxe to Thompson, accompanied Thompson across the continent to Lake Superior before journeying on to England.

Thompson wintered at Saleesh House before beginning his final journey in 1812 back to Montreal, where the North West Company was based.

In his published journals, Thompson recorded seeing large footprints (“which measured fourteen inches in length by eight inches in breadth”) near what is now Jasper, Alberta, in 1811. It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the sasquatch. However, Thompson noted that these tracks showed &quot;a small Nail at the end of each [toe]&quot;, which led him to surmise it was a bear, but he had doubts, saying, &quot;I held it to be the track of a large old grizzled bear; yet the shortness of the nails, the ball of the foot, and its great size was not that of a Bear&quot;.

The years 1807-1812 are the most carefully scrutinized in his career and comprise his most enduring historical legacy, due to his development of the commercial routes across the Rockies, and his mapping of the lands they traverse.

==Appearance and personality==

In 1820, the English geologist, John Jeremiah Bigsby, attended a dinner party given by The Hon. William McGillivray at his home, Chateau St. Antoine, one of the early estates in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile. He describes the party and some of the guests in his entertaining book &quot;The Shoe and Canoe&quot;, giving an excellent description of David Thompson:

==Marriage and children==
On 10 June 1799 at Île-à-la-Crosse, Thompson married Charlotte Small, a thirteen-year-old Métis daughter of Scottish fur trader Patrick Small and a Cree mother. Their marriage was formalised thirteen years later at the Scotch Presbyterian Church in Montreal on 30 October 1812. He and Charlotte had 13 children together; five of them were born before he left the fur trade. The family did not adjust easily to life in Eastern Canada; they lived in Montreal while he was travelling. Two of the children, John (aged 5) and Emma (aged 7), died of round worms, a common parasite. By the time of Thompson&#x27;s death, the couple had been married 57 years, the longest marriage known in Canada pre-Confederation.

==Later life==

Upon his arrival back in Montreal, Thompson retired with a generous pension from the North West Company. He settled in nearby Terrebonne and worked on completing his great map, a summary of his lifetime of exploring and surveying the interior of North America. The map covered the wide area stretching from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and was given by Thompson to the North West Company. Thompson&#x27;s 1814 map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis for many of the maps issued by the Canadian government. It now resides in the Archives of Ontario.

In 1815, Thompson moved his family to Williamstown, Upper Canada, and a few years later was employed to survey the newly established borders with the United States from Lake of the Woods to the Eastern Townships of Quebec, established by Treaty of Ghent after the War of 1812. In 1843 Thompson completed his atlas of the region from Hudson Bay to the Pacific Ocean.

Afterwards, Thompson returned to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt he was forced to take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed him completely in 1851.

==Death and afterward==
The land mass mapped by Thompson amounted to of wilderness (one-fifth of the continent). His contemporary, the great explorer Alexander Mackenzie, remarked that Thompson did more in ten months than he would have thought possible in two years.

Despite these significant achievements, Thompson died in Montreal in near obscurity on 10 February 1857, his accomplishments almost unrecognised. He never finished the book of his 28 years in the fur trade, based on his 77 field notebooks, before he died. In the 1890s geologist J.B. Tyrrell resurrected Thompson&#x27;s notes and in 1916 published them as &quot;David Thompson&#x27;s Narrative&quot;, as part of the General Series of the Champlain Society. Further editions and re-examinations of Thompson&#x27;s life and works were published in 1962 by Richard Glover, in 1971 by Victor Hopwood, and in 2015 by William Moreau.
Thompson&#x27;s body was interred in Montreal&#x27;s Mount Royal Cemetery in an unmarked grave. It was not until 1926 that efforts by J.B. Tyrrell and the Canadian Historical Society resulted in the placing of a tombstone to mark his grave. The next year, Thompson was named a National Historic Person by the federal government, one of the earliest such designations. A federal plaque reflecting that status is at Jasper National Park, Alberta. Meantime, Thompson&#x27;s achievements are central reasons for other national historic designations:
* David Thompson on the Columbia River National Historic Event, marked at Castlegar, BC
* Athabasca Pass National Historic Site (NHS), at Jasper National Park
* Boat Encampment NHS, BC
* Howse Pass NHS, Banff National Park, Alberta
* Kootenae House NHS, BC
* Rocky Mountain House NHS, Alberta

In 1957, one hundred years after his death, Canada&#x27;s post office department honoured him with his image on a postage stamp. The David Thompson Highway in Alberta was named in his honour, along with David Thompson High School on the side of the highway near Leslieville, Alberta. There are also two David Thompson Secondary Schools, one in Vancouver, BC, and one in Invermere, BC.

His prowess as a geographer is now well-recognized. He has been called &quot;the greatest land geographer that the world has produced.&quot;

There is a monument dedicated to David Thompson (maintained by the state of North Dakota) near the former town site of the ghost town Verendrye, North Dakota, located approximately north and west of Karlsruhe, North Dakota. Thompson Falls, Montana, and British Columbia&#x27;s Thompson River and Thompson Falls on the Blaeberry River are also named after the explorer.
The year 2007 marked the 150th year of Thompson&#x27;s death and the 200th anniversary of his first crossing of the Rocky Mountains. Commemorative events and exhibits were planned across Canada and the United States from 2007 to 2011 as a celebration of his accomplishments.

In 2007, a commemorative plaque was placed on a wall at the Grey Coat Hospital, the school for the disadvantaged of Westminster David Thompson attended as a boy, by English author and TV presenter Ray Mears.

Thompson was the subject of a 1964 National Film Board of Canada short film &quot;David Thompson: The Great Mapmaker &quot;, as well as the BBC2 programme &quot;Ray Mears&#x27; Northern Wilderness&quot; (Episode 5), broadcast in November 2009. He&#x27;s also the subject of 2010 KSPS-TV film Uncharted Territory: David Thompson on the Columbia Plateau.

He is referenced in the 1981 folk song &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; by Stan Rogers.

The national park service, Parks Canada, announced in 2018 that it had named its new research vessel , to be used for underwater archaeology, including sea floor mapping, and for marine science in the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic Oceans, and the Great Lakes. It will be the main platform for research on the Wrecks of HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot; National Historic Site.

The David Thompson Astronomical Observatory at Fort William Historical Park was named to commemorate David Thompson and his discoveries.

<text>The Dioscoreales are an order of monocotyledonous flowering plants, organized under modern classification systems, such as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group or the Angiosperm Phylogeny Web. Among monocot plants, Dioscoreales are grouped with the lilioid monocots, wherein they are a sister group to the Pandanales. In total, the order Dioscoreales comprises three families, 22 genera and about 850 species.

Dioscoreales contains the family Dioscoreaceae, which notably includes the yams (&quot;Dioscorea&quot;) and several other bulbous and tuberous plants, some of which are heavily cultivated as staple food sources in certain countries. 

Certain species are found solely in arid climates (incl. parts of Southern Africa), and have adapted to this harsh environment as caudex-forming, perennial caudiciformes, including &quot;Dioscorea elephantipes&quot;, the &quot;elephant&#x27;s foot&quot; or &quot;elephant-foot yam&quot;.

Older systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with reticulate veined leaves (such as Smilacaceae and Stemonaceae together with Dioscoraceae) in Dioscoreales; as currently circumscribed by phylogenetic analysis, using combined morphology and molecular methods, Dioscreales now contains many reticulate-veined vines within the Dioscoraceae, as well as the myco-heterotrophic Burmanniaceae and the autotrophic Nartheciaceae.

==Description==
Dioscoreales are vines or herbaceous forest floor plants. They may be achlorophyllous or saprophytic. Synapomorphies include tuberous roots, glandular hairs, seed coat characteristics and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. Other characteristics of the order include the presence of saponin steroids, annular vascular bundles that are found in both the stem and leaf. The leaves are often unsheathed at the base, have a distinctive petiole and reticulate veined lamina. Alternatively they may be small and scale-like with a sheathed base. The flowers are actinomorphic, and may be bisexual or dioecious, while the flowers or inflorescence bear glandular hairs. The perianth may be conspicuous or reduced and the style is short with well developed style branches. The tepals persist in the development of the fruit, which is a dry capsule or berry. In the seed, the endotegmen is tanniferous and the embryo short.

All of the species except the genera placed in Nartheciaceae express simultaneous microsporogenesis. Plants in Nartheciaceae show successive microsporogenesis which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order.

==Taxonomy==

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
For the early history from Lindley (1853) onwards, see Caddick &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) Table 1, Caddick et al. (2002a) Table 1 and Table 2 in Bouman (1995). The taxonomic classification of Dioscoreales has been complicated by the presence of a number of morphological features reminiscent of the dicotyledons, leading some authors to place the order as intermediate between the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons.
While Lindley did not use the term &quot;Dioscoreales&quot;, he placed the family Dioscoraceae together with four other families in what he referred to as an Alliance (the equivalent of the modern Order) called Dictyogens. He reflected the uncertainty as to the place of this Alliance by placing it as a class of its own between Endogens (monocots) and Exogens (dicots) The botanical authority is given to von Martius (1835) by APG for his description of the family Dioscoreae or &quot;Ordo&quot;, while other sources cite Hooker (Dioscoreales Hook.f.) for his use of the term &quot;Dioscorales&quot; in 1873 with a single family, Dioscoreae. However, in his more definitive work, the &quot;Genera plantara&quot; (1883), he simply placed Dioscoraceae in the Epigynae &quot;Series&quot;.

===Post-Darwinian===
Although Charles Darwin&#x27;s Origin of Species (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker&#x27;s publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and George Bentham was initially sceptical of Darwinism. The new phyletic approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the circumscription of Dioscoreaceae. The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the German literature. Authors such as Eichler, Engler and Wettstein placed this family in the Liliiflorae, a major subdivision of monocotyledons. it remained to Hutchinson (1926) to resurrect the Dioscoreales to group Dioscoreaceae and related families together. Hutchinson&#x27;s circumscription of Dioscoreales included three other families in addition to Dioscoreaceae, Stenomeridaceae, Trichopodaceae and Roxburghiaceae. Of these only Trichopodaceae was included in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (see below), but was subsumed into Dioscoraceae. Stenomeridaceae, as &quot;Stenomeris&quot; was also included in Dioscoreaceae as subfamily Stenomeridoideae, the remaining genera being grouped in subfamily Dioscoreoideae. Roxburghiaceae on the other hand was segregated in the sister order Pandanales as Stemonaceae. Most taxonomists in the twentieth century (the exception was the 1981 Cronquist system which placed most such plants in order Liliales, subclass Liliidae, class Liliopsida=monocotyledons, division Magnoliophyta=angiosperms) recognised Dioscoreales as a distinct order, but demonstrated wide variations in its composition.

Dahlgren, in the second version of his taxonomic classification (1982) raised the Liliiflorae to a superorder and placed Dioscoreales as an order within it. In his system, Dioscoreales contained only three families, Dioscoreaceae, Stemonaceae (&quot;i.e.&quot; Hutchinson&#x27;s Roxburghiaceae) and Trilliaceae. The latter two families had been treated as a separate order (Stemonales, or Roxburghiales) by other authors, such as Huber (1969). The APG would later assign these to Pandanales and Liliales respectively. Dahlgren&#x27;s construction of Dioscoreaceae included the Stenomeridaceae and Trichopodaceae, doubting these were distinct, and Croomiaceae in Stemonaceae. Furthermore, he expressed doubts about the order&#x27;s homogeneity, especially Trilliaceae. The Dioscoreales at that time were marginally distinguishable from the Asparagales. In his examination of Huber&#x27;s Stemonales, he found that the two constituent families had as close an affinity to Dioscoreaceae as to each other, and hence included them. He also considered closely related families and their relationship to Dioscoreales, such as the monogeneric Taccaceae, then in its own order, Taccales. Similar considerations were discussed with respect to two Asparagales families, Smilacaceae and Petermanniaceae.

In Dahlgren&#x27;s third and final version (1985) that broader circumscription of Dioscoreales was created within the superorder Lilianae, subclass Liliidae (monocotyledons), class Magnoliopsida (angiosperms) and comprised the seven families Dioscoreaceae, Petermanniaceae, Smilacaceae, Stemonaceae, Taccaceae, Trichopodaceae and Trilliaceae. Thismiaceae has either been treated as a separate family closely related to Burmanniaceae or as a tribe (Thismieae) within a more broadly defined Burmanniaceae, forming a separate order, Burmanniales, in the Dahlgren system. The related Nartheciaceae were treated as tribe Narthecieae within the Melanthiaceae in a third order, the Melanthiales, by Dahlgren. Dahlgren considered the Dioscoreales to most strongly resemble the ancestral monocotyledons, and hence sharing &quot;dicotyledonous&quot; characteristics, making it the most central monocotyledon order. Of these seven families, Bouman considered Dioscoreaceae, Trichopodaceae, Stemonaceae and Taccaceae to represent the &quot;core&quot; families of the order. However, that study also indicated both a clear delineation of the order from other orders particularly Asparagales, and a lack of homogeneity within the order.

=== Molecular phylogenetics and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ===
The increasing availability of molecular phylogenetics methods in addition to morphological characteristics in the 1990s led to major reconsiderations of the relationships within the monocotyledons. In that large multi-institutional examination of the seed plants using the plastid gene &quot;rbc&quot;L the authors used Dahlgren&#x27;s system as their basis, but followed Thorne (1992) in altering the suffixes of the superorders from &quot;&quot;-iflorae&quot; to &quot;-anae&quot;&quot;. This demonstrated that the Lilianae comprised three lineages corresponding to Dahlgren&#x27;s orders Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagaless.

Under the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system of 1998, which took Dahlgren&#x27;s system as a basis, the order was placed in the monocot clade and comprised the five families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Taccaceae, Thismiaceae and Trichopodaceae.

In APG II (2003), a number of changes were made to Dioscoreales, as a result of an extensive study by Caddick and colleagues (2002), using an analysis of three genes, &quot;rbc&quot;L, &quot;atp&quot;B and 18S rDNA, in addition to morphology. These studies resulted in a re-examination of the relationships between most of the genera within the order. Thismiaceae was shown to be a sister group to Burmanniaceae, and so was included in it. The monotypic families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae were included in Dioscoreaceae, while Nartheciaceae could also be grouped within Dioscoreales. APG III (2009) did not change this, so the order now comprises three families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae.

Although further research on the deeper relationships within Dioscoreales continues, the APG IV (2016) authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order. Specifically these issues involve conflicting information as to the relationship between &quot;Thismia&quot; and Burmanniaceae, and hence whether Thismiaceae should be subsumed in the latter, or reinstated.

=== Phylogeny ===
Molecular phylogenetics in Dioscoreales poses special problems due to the absence of plastid genes in mycoheterotrophs. Dioscoreales is monophyletic and is placed as a sister order to Pandanales, as shown in Cladogram I.

=== Evolution ===
The data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses since there are no such fossils found. It is estimated that Dioscoreales and its sister clade Pandanales split up around 121 million years ago during Early Cretaceous when the stem group was formed. Then it took 3 to 6 million years for the crown group to differentiate in Mid Cretaceous.

=== Subdivision ===
The three families of Dioscreales constitutes about 22 genera and about 849 species making it one of the smaller monocot orders. Of these, the largest group is &quot;Dioscorea&quot; (yams) with about 450 species. By contrast the second largest genus is &quot;Burmannia&quot; with about 60 species, and most have only one or two.

Some authors, preferring the original APG (1998)families, continue to treat Thismiaceae separately from Burmanniaceae and Taccaceae from Dioscoreaceae. But in the 2015 study of Hertwerk and colleagues, seven genera representing all three families were examined with an eight gene dataset. Dioscoreales was monophyletic and three subclades were represented corresponding to the APG families. Dioscoreaceae and Burmanniaceae were in a sister group relationship.

=== Etymology ===
Named after the type genus &quot;Dioscorea&quot;, which in turn was named by Linnaeus in 1753 to honour the Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides.

== Distribution and habitat==
Species from this order are distributed across all of the continents except Antarctica. They are mainly tropical or subtropical representatives, but some members of families Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae are found in cooler regions of Europe and North America. Order Dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of nutritions as many other monocots. An exception is the family Burmanniaceae which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack photosynthetic abilities.

==Ecology==

The three families included in order Dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants. Dioscoreaceae contains mainly vines (&quot;Dioscorea&quot;) and other crawling species (&quot;Epipetrum&quot;). Nartheciaceae on the other hand is a family composed of herbaceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance (&quot;Aletris&quot;) while Burmanniaceae is entirely myco-heterotrophic group.

== Uses ==
Many members of Dioscoreaceae produce tuberous starchy roots (yams) which form staple foods in tropical regions. They have also been the source of steroids for the pharmaceutical industry, including the production of oral contraceptives.

<doc id="8005" wikidata="Q12128" url="?curid=8005" title="Dentistry">
<text>Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth. It consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the mouth, most commonly focused on dentition (the development and arrangement of teeth) as well as the oral mucosa. Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.

The history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization, with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC. Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine which has gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specializations. Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish. In European history, dentistry is considered to have stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons.

Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries (such as dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and dental therapists). Most dentists either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals, or (secondary care) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).

The modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific research and evidence to guide decision-making such as in manual tooth conservation, use of fluoride water treatment and fluoride toothpaste, dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis, as well as systematic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS which could also affect the oral cavity. Other practices relevant to evidence-based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect teeth deformity or oral malaises, haematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery, cardiology (due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery with patients with heart disease), etc.

==Terminology==
The term dentistry comes from &quot;dentist&quot;, which comes from French &quot;dentiste&quot;, which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth. The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology (from ) – the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.

Dentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.

The majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gum disease or pyorrhea). Common treatments involve the restoration of teeth, extraction or surgical removal of teeth, scaling and root planing, endodontic root canal treatment, and cosmetic dentistry

By nature of their general training, dentists, without specialization can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic (dentures), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications used in the field such as antibiotics, sedatives, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.

Dentists also encourage the prevention of oral diseases through proper hygiene and regular, twice or more yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease or cancer. Many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and preterm birth. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as &quot;oral-systemic health&quot;.

==Education and licensing==

John M. Harris started the world&#x27;s first dental school in Bainbridge, Ohio, and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a dental museum. The first dental college, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the Ohio College of Dental Surgery, established in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1845. The Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery followed in 1852. In 1907, Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.

Studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries, or even from different dental schools in one country, may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from Israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.

In the United Kingdom, the first dental schools, the London School of Dental Surgery and the Metropolitan School of Dental Science, both in London, opened in 1859. The British Dentists Act of 1878 and the 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of &quot;dentist&quot; and &quot;dental surgeon&quot; to qualified and registered practitioners. However, others could legally describe themselves as &quot;dental experts&quot; or &quot;dental consultants&quot;. The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry. The British Dental Association, formed in 1880 with Sir John Tomes as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally. Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the General Dental Council.

In many countries, dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree. In a few countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study; Dental degrees awarded around the world include the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) and Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) in North America (US and Canada), and the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae (BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc) in the UK and current and former British Commonwealth countries.

All dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a &quot;Doctor of Dental Surgery&quot; (DDS) or &quot;Doctor of Dental Medicine&quot; (DMD). Specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of Anesthesiology, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orofacial Pain, Pathology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry (Pedodontics), Periodontics, and Prosthodontics.

==Specialties ==
Some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:
* Anesthesiology – The specialty of dentistry that deals with the advanced use of general anesthesia, sedation and pain management to facilitate dental procedures.
*Cosmetic dentistry – Focuses on improving the appearance of the mouth, teeth and smile.
* Dental public health – The study of epidemiology and social health policies relevant to oral health.
* Endodontics (also called &quot;endodontology&quot;) – Root canal therapy and study of diseases of the dental pulp and periapical tissues.
* Forensic odontology – The gathering and use of dental evidence in law. This may be performed by any dentist with experience or training in this field. The function of the forensic dentist is primarily documentation and verification of identity.
* Geriatric dentistry or &quot;geriodontics&quot; – The delivery of dental care to older adults involving the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of problems associated with normal aging and age-related diseases as part of an interdisciplinary team with other health care professionals.
* Oral and maxillofacial pathology – The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial related diseases.
* Oral and maxillofacial radiology – The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
* Oral and maxillofacial surgery (also called &quot;oral surgery&quot;) – Extractions, implants, and surgery of the jaws, mouth and face.
* Oral biology – Research in dental and craniofacial biology
* Oral Implantology – The art and science of replacing extracted teeth with dental implants.
* Oral medicine – The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases
* Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics – The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
* Pediatric dentistry (also called &quot;pedodontics&quot;) – Dentistry for children
* Periodontology (also called &quot;periodontics&quot;) – The study and treatment of diseases of the periodontium (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
* Prosthodontics (also called &quot;prosthetic dentistry&quot;) – Dentures, bridges and the restoration of implants. 
** Some prosthodontists super-specialize in maxillofacial prosthetics, which is the discipline originally concerned with the rehabilitation of patients with congenital facial and oral defects such as cleft lip and palate or patients born with an underdeveloped ear (microtia). Today, most maxillofacial prosthodontists return function and esthetics to patients with acquired defects secondary to surgical removal of head and neck tumors, or secondary to trauma from war or motor vehicle accidents.
* Special needs dentistry (also called &quot;special care dentistry&quot;) – Dentistry for those with developmental and acquired disabilities.
* Sports dentistry – the branch of sports medicine dealing with prevention and treatment of dental injuries and oral diseases associated with sports and exercise. The sports dentist works as an individual consultant or as a member of the Sports Medicine Team.
* Veterinary dentistry – The field of dentistry applied to the care of animals. It is a specialty of veterinary medicine.

==History==

Tooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the advent of farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay (cavities). An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry, although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the Neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools. In Italy evidence dated to the Paleolithic, around 13,000 years ago, points to bitumen used to fill a tooth and in Neolithic Slovenia, 6500 years ago, beeswax was used to close a fracture in a tooth. The Indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC, during the Stone Age. The Neolithic site of Mehrgarh (now in Pakistan&#x27;s south western province of Balochistan) indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead-crafters. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in Slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago. Dentistry was practised in prehistoric Malta, as evidenced by a skull which had a dental abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around 2500 BC. The practice of dentistry dates back thousands of years, with evidence of dental procedures such as tooth extraction and fillings found in ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and the Greeks. One notable historical figure is Pierre Fauchard, often referred to as the &#x27;father of modern dentistry,&#x27; who wrote the first comprehensive book on the subject in 1728.

An ancient Sumerian text describes a &quot;tooth worm&quot; as the cause of dental caries. Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon Guy de Chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.

Recipes for the treatment of toothache, infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Papyri, Brugsch Papyrus, and Hearst papyrus of Ancient Egypt. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws. In the 18th century BC, the Code of Hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment. Examination of the remains of some ancient Egyptians and Greco-Romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics. However, it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons.

Ancient Greek scholars Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with forceps, and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws. Use of dental appliances, bridges and dentures was applied by the Etruscans in northern Italy, from as early as 700 BC, of human or other animal teeth fastened together with gold bands. The Romans had likely borrowed this technique by the 5th century BC. The Phoenicians crafted dentures during the 6th–4th century BC, fashioning them from gold wire and incorporating two ivory teeth. In ancient Egypt, Hesy-Ra is the first named &quot;dentist&quot; (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire. Roman medical writer Cornelius Celsus wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing emollients and astringents. The earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang dynasty medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.

During the Islamic Golden Age Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as The Canon in medicine written by Avicenna and Al-Tasreef by Al-Zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the Middle Ages, Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. Al-Zahrawi invented over 200 surgical tools that resemble the modern kind.

Historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the Middle Ages and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. Barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican (resembling a pelican&#x27;s beak) which was used to perform dental extractions up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the dental key which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.

The first book focused solely on dentistry was the &quot;Artzney Buchlein&quot; in 1530, and the first dental textbook written in English was called &quot;Operator for the Teeth&quot; by Charles Allen in 1685.

In the United Kingdom, there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.

===Modern dentistry===

It was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician Thomas Browne in his &quot;A Letter to a Friend&quot; ( pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:

The French surgeon Pierre Fauchard became known as the &quot;father of modern dentistry&quot;. Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled surgeon who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from watchmakers, jewelers and even barbers, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities. He asserted that sugar-derived acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay, and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the gums could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.

Fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he invented many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. He also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist. The French text included &quot;basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery&quot;.

After Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, &quot;Natural History of Human Teeth&quot; (1771) and &quot;Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth&quot; (1778), were published by British surgeon John Hunter. In 1763, he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of a successful tooth transplant (initially, at least) would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient. These principles are still used in the transplantation of internal organs. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients&#x27; gums, one of Hunter&#x27;s patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.

Major advances in science were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK, the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, Francis Brodie Imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.

===Hazards in modern dentistry===

Long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear. NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA. For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.

Within the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners. While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA, prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus. Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices, which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.

===Evidence-based dentistry===

There is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. Evidence-based dentistry (EBD) uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient&#x27;s oral and medical health. Along with the dentist&#x27;s professional skill and expertise, EBD allows dentists to stay up to date on the latest procedures and patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients. It was first introduced by Gordon Guyatt and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s. It is part of the larger movement toward evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based practices, especially since a major part of dentistry involves dealing with oral and systemic diseases. Other issues relevant to the dental field in terms of evidence-based research and evidence-based practice include population oral health, dental clinical practice, tooth morphology etc. 
== Ethical and medicolegal issues ==
Dentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence-based clinical skills that can only be acquired through supervised specialized laboratory training and direct patient care. This necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of extensive research-based education. According to some experts, the accreditation of dental schools can enhance the quality and professionalism of dental education.

<text>In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the centre of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.

In more modern usage, the length formula_1 of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of diameter rather than diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius formula_2

:formula_3

The word &quot;diameter&quot; is derived from (), &quot;diameter of a circle&quot;, from (), &quot;across, through&quot; and (), &quot;measure&quot;. It is often abbreviated formula_4 or formula_5

== Constructions ==
With straightedge and compass, a diameter of a given circle can be constructed as the perpendicular bisector of an arbitrary chord. Drawing two diameters in this way can be used to locate the center of a circle, as their crossing point. To construct a diameter parallel to a given line, choose the chord to be perpendicular to the line.

The circle having a given line segment as its diameter can be constructed by straightedge and compass, by finding the midpoint of the segment and then drawing the circle centered at the midpoint through one of the ends of the line segment.

== Symbol ==

The symbol or variable for diameter, , is sometimes used in technical drawings or specifications as a prefix or suffix for a number (e.g. &quot;⌀ 55 mm&quot;), indicating that it represents diameter. Photographic filter thread sizes are often denoted in this way.

The symbol has a code point in Unicode at , in the Miscellaneous Technical set. It should not be confused with several other characters (such as or ) that resemble it but have unrelated meanings. It has the compose sequence .

== Generalizations ==
The definitions given above are only valid for circles and spheres. However, they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of formula_6-dimensional object, or a set of scattered points. The diameter of a set is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset.

A different and incompatible definition is sometimes used for the diameter of a conic section. In this context, a diameter is any chord which passes through the conic&#x27;s centre. A diameter of an ellipse is any line passing through the centre of the ellipse. Half of any such diameter may be called a &quot;semidiameter&quot;, although this term is most often a synonym for the radius of a circle or sphere. The longest diameter is called the major axis. Conjugate diameters are a pair of diameters where one is parallel to a tangent to the ellipse at the endpoint of the other diameter.

Several kinds of object can be measured by equivalent diameter, the diameter of a circular or spherical approximation to the object. This includes hydraulic diameter, the equivalent diameter of a channel or pipe through which liquid flows, and the Sauter mean diameter of a collection of particles.

The diameter of a circle is exactly twice its radius. However, this is true only for a circle, and only in the Euclidean metric. Jung&#x27;s theorem provides more general inequalities relating the diameter to the radius.

<text>The direct examination or examination-in-chief is one stage in the process of evidence from witnesses in a court of law. Direct examination is the questioning of a witness by the lawyer/side/party that called such witness in a trial. Direct examination is usually performed to elicit evidence in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party&#x27;s claim or defense.

In direct examination, one is generally prohibited from asking leading questions. This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a favorable witness. An exception to this rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood or becomes clear, that the witness is hostile to the calling lawyer&#x27;s side of the controversy, the lawyer who called the witness may then ask the court to declare the person on the stand a hostile witness. If the court does so, the lawyer may thereafter ask witness leading questions during direct examination.

The techniques of direct examination are taught in courses on trial advocacy. Each direct examination is integrated with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort.
