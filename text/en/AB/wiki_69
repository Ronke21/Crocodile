<text>are a broad range of Japanese percussion instruments. In Japanese, the term refers to any kind of drum, but outside Japan, it is used specifically to refer to any of the various Japanese drums called and to the form of ensemble drumming more specifically called . The process of constructing varies between manufacturers, and the preparation of both the drum body and skin can take several years depending on the method.

 have a mythological origin in Japanese folklore, but historical records suggest that were introduced to Japan through Chinese and Korean cultural influence as early as the 6th century CE; pottery from the Haniwa period depicting drums has also been found. Some are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports the view that were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period. Their function has varied throughout history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, religious ceremony and concert performances. In modern times, have also played a central role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.

 performance, characterized by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of Daihachi Oguchi and later in 1961 by the Ondekoza, and was made later popular with many other groups copying the format of Ondekoza such as Kodo, Yamato, Tao, Taikoza, Fuun No Kai, Sukeroku Taiko, etc. Other performance styles, such as , have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. performance groups are active not only in Japan, but also in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Taiwan, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, form, stick grip, clothing, and the particular instrumentation. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped as well as smaller . Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.
==History==

===Origin===

The origin of the and its variants is unclear, though there have been many suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the earliest date from 588 CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the , a drum that originated in South China. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of . Certain court music styles, especially and , arrived in Japan through both China and Korea. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to . Certain percussive patterns and terminology in , an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the , also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in performance.

Archaeological evidence shows that were used in Japan as early as the 6th century CE, during the latter part of the Kofun period, and were likely used for communication, in festivals, and in other rituals. This evidence was substantiated by the discovery of haniwa statues in the Sawa District of Gunma Prefecture. Two of these figures are depicted playing drums; one of them, wearing skins, is equipped with a barrel-shaped drum hung from his shoulder and uses a stick to play the drum at hip height. This statue is titled &quot;Man Beating the &quot; and is considered the oldest evidence of performance in Japan. Similarities between the playing style demonstrated by this and known music traditions in China and Korea further suggest influences from these regions.

The , the second-oldest book of Japanese classical history, contains a mythological story describing the origin of . The myth tells how Amaterasu, who had sealed herself inside a cave in anger, was beckoned out by an elder goddess Ame-no-Uzume when others had failed. Ame-no-Uzume accomplished this by emptying out a barrel of sake and dancing furiously on top of it. Historians regard her performance as the mythological creation of music.

===Use in warfare===

In feudal Japan, were often used to motivate troops, call out orders or announcements, and set a marching pace; marches were usually set to six paces per beat of the drum. During the 16th-century Warring States period, specific drum calls were used to communicate orders for retreating and advancing. Other rhythms and techniques were detailed in period texts. According to the war chronicle , nine sets of five beats would summon an ally to battle, while nine sets of three beats, sped up three or four times, was the call to advance and pursue an enemy. Folklore from the 16th century on the legendary 6th-century Emperor Keitai offers a story that he obtained a large drum from China, which he named . The Emperor was thought to have used it to both encourage his own army and intimidate his enemies.

===In traditional settings===
 have been incorporated in Japanese theatre for rhythmic needs, general atmosphere, and in certain settings decoration. In the kabuki play &quot;The Tale of Shiroishi and the Taihei Chronicles&quot;, scenes in the pleasure quarters are accompanied by to create dramatic tension. Noh theatre also features music, where performance consists of highly specific rhythmic patterns. The school of drumming, for example, contains 65 basic patterns in addition to 25 special patterns; these patterns are categorized in several classes. Differences between these patterns include changes in tempo, accent, dynamics, pitch, and function in the theatrical performance. Patterns are also often connected together in progressions.

 continue to be used in , a classical music tradition typically performed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace in addition to local temples and shrines. In , one component of the art form is traditional dance, which is guided in part by the rhythm set by the .

 have played an important role in many local festivals across Japan. They are also used to accompany religious ritual music. In , a category of music and dances stemming from Shinto practices, frequently appear alongside other performers during local festivals. In Buddhist traditions, are used for ritual dances as part of the Bon Festival. , along with other instruments, are featured atop towers that are adorned with red-and-white cloth and serve to provide rhythms for the dancers who are encircled around the performers.


In addition to the instruments, the term also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called , or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in performance.

Oguchi&#x27;s ensemble, Osuwa Daiko, incorporated these alterations and other drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances. Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. Oedo Sukeroku Daiko was formed in Tokyo in 1959 under Seidō Kobayashi, and has been referred to as the first group who toured professionally. Globally, performance became more visible during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.

 was also developed through the leadership of , who gathered young men who were willing to devote their entire lifestyle to playing and took them to Sado Island for training where Den and his family had settled in 1968. Den chose the island based on a desire to reinvigorate the folk arts in Japan, particularly ; he became inspired by a drumming tradition unique to Sado called that required considerable strength to play well. Den called the group &quot;Za Ondekoza&quot; or Ondekoza for short, and implemented a rigorous set of exercises for its members including long-distance running. In 1975, Ondekoza was the first group to tour in the United States. Their first performance occurred just after the group finished running the Boston Marathon while wearing their traditional uniforms. In 1981, some members of Ondekoza split from Den and formed another group called Kodo under the leadership of Eitetsu Hayashi. Kodo continued to use Sado Island for rigorous training and communal living, and went on to popularize through frequent touring and collaborations with other musical performers. Kodo is one of the most recognized groups both in Japan and worldwide.

Estimates of the number of groups in Japan vary to up to 5,000 active groups in Japan, but more conservative assessments place the number closer to 800 based on membership in the Nippon Taiko Foundation, the largest national organization of groups. Some pieces that have emerged from early groups that continue to be performed include Yatai-bayashi from Ondekoza, from Osuwa Daiko, and from Kodo.

==Categorization==
Taiko have been developed into a broad range of percussion instruments that are used in both Japanese folk and classical musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by Francis Taylor Piggott in 1909. Taiko are generally classified based on the construction process, or the specific context in which the drum is used, but some are not classified, such as the toy den-den daiko.

With few exceptions, taiko have a drum shell with heads on both sides of the body, and a sealed resonating cavity. The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes. Taiko may be either tunable or non-tunable depending on the system used.

Taiko are categorized into three types based on construction process. &quot;Byō-uchi-daiko&quot; are constructed with the drumhead nailed to the body. &quot;Shime-daiko&quot; are classically constructed with the skin placed over iron or steel rings, which are then tightened with ropes. Contemporary &quot;shime-daiko&quot; are tensioned using bolts or turnbuckles systems attached to the drum body. &quot;Tsuzumi&quot; are also rope-tensioned drums, but have a distinct hourglass shape and their skins are made using deerskin.

&quot;Byō-uchi-daiko&quot; were historically made only using a single piece of wood; they continue to be made in this manner, but are also constructed from staves of wood. Larger drums can be made using a single piece of wood, but at a much greater cost due to the difficulty in finding appropriate trees. The preferred wood is the Japanese zelkova or &quot;keyaki&quot;, but a number of other woods, and even wine barrels, have been used to create taiko. &quot;Byō-uchi-daiko&quot; cannot be tuned.

The typical &quot;byō-uchi-daiko&quot; is the &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot;, an elongated drum that is roughly shaped like a wine barrel. &quot;Nagadō-daiko&quot; are available in a variety of sizes, and their head diameter is traditionally measured in shaku (units of roughly 30 cm). Head diameters range from . are the smallest of these drums and are usually about in diameter. The is a medium-sized &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot; ranging from , and weighing about . vary in size, and are often as large as in diameter. Some &quot;ō-daiko&quot; are difficult to move due to their size, and therefore permanently remain inside the performance space, such as temple or shrine. &quot;Ō-daiko&quot; means &quot;large drum&quot; and for a given ensemble, the term refers to their largest drum. The other type of &quot;byō-uchi-daiko&quot; is called a and can be any drum constructed such that the head diameter is greater than the length of the body.

&quot;Shime-daiko&quot; are a set of smaller, roughly snare drum-sized instrument that are tunable. The tensioning system usually consists of hemp cords or rope, but bolt or turnbuckle systems have been used as well. , sometimes referred to as &quot;taiko&quot; in the context of theater, have thinner heads than other kinds of shime-daiko. The head includes a patch of deerskin placed in the center, and in performance, drum strokes are generally restricted to this area. The is a heavier type of &quot;shime-daiko&quot;. They are available in sizes 1–5, and are named according to their number: &quot;namitsuke&quot; (1), &quot;nichō-gakke&quot; (2), &quot;sanchō-gakke&quot; (3), &quot;yonchō-gakke&quot; (4), and &quot;gochō-gakke&quot; (5). The &quot;namitsuke&quot; has the thinnest skins and the shortest body in terms of height; thickness and tension of skins, as well as body height, increase toward the &quot;gochō-gakke&quot;. The head diameters of all &quot;shime-daiko&quot; sizes are around .

 is a type of racket-shaped Japanese drum. It is the only Japanese traditional drum without a sound box and only one skin. It is played with a drumstick while hanging it with the other hand.

&quot;Okedō-daiko&quot; or simply &quot;okedō&quot;, are a type of &quot;shime-daiko&quot; that are stave-constructed using narrower strips of wood, have a tube-shaped frame. Like other &quot;shime-daiko&quot;, drum heads are attached by metal hoops and fastened by rope or cords. &quot;Okedō&quot; can be played using the same drumsticks (called &quot;bachi&quot;) as &quot;shime-daiko&quot;, but can also be hand-played. &quot;Okedō&quot; come in short- and long-bodied types.

&quot;Tsuzumi&quot; are a class of hourglass-shaped drums. The drum body is shaped on a spool and the inner body carved by hand. Their skins can be made from cowhide, horsehide, or deerskin. While the &quot;ō-tsuzumi&quot; skins are made from cowhide, &quot;ko-tsuzumi&quot; are made from horsehide. While some classify &quot;tsuzumi&quot; as a type of taiko, others have described them as a drum entirely separate from taiko.

Taiko can also be categorized by the context in which they are used. The &quot;miya-daiko&quot;, for instance, is constructed in the same manner as other &quot;byō-uchi-daiko&quot;, but is distinguished by an ornamental stand and is used for ceremonial purposes at Buddhist temples. The (a &quot;ko-daiko&quot;) and (a &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot; with a cigar-shaped body) are used in sumo and festivals respectively.
Several drums, categorized as &quot;gagakki&quot;, are used in the Japanese theatrical form, gagaku. The lead instrument of the ensemble is the kakko, which is a smaller &quot;shime-daiko&quot; with heads made of deerskin, and is placed horizontally on a stand during performance. A &quot;tsuzumi&quot;, called the &quot;san-no-tsuzumi&quot; is another small drum in gagaku that is placed horizontally and struck with a thin stick. are the largest drums of the ensemble, and have heads that are about in diameter. During performance, the drum is placed on a tall pedestals and surrounded by a rim decoratively painted with flames and adorned with mystical figures such as wyverns. &quot;Dadaiko&quot; are played while standing, and are usually only played on the downbeat of the music. The is a smaller drum that produces a lower sound, its head measuring about in diameter. It is used in ensembles that accompany bugaku, a traditional dance performed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace and in religious contexts. &quot;Tsuri-daiko&quot; are suspended on a small stand, and are played sitting down. &quot;Tsuri-daiko&quot; performers typically use shorter mallets covered in leather knobs instead of bachi. They can be played simultaneously by two performers; while one performer plays on the head, another performer uses bachi on the body of the drum.

The larger &quot;ō-tsuzumi&quot; and smaller &quot;ko-tsuzumi&quot; are used in the opening and dances of Noh theater. Both drums are struck using the fingers; players can also adjust pitch by manually applying pressure to the ropes on the drum. The color of the cords of these drums also indicates the skill of the musician: Orange and red for amateur players, light blue for performers with expertise, and lilac for masters of the instrument. &quot;Nagauta-shime daiko&quot; or &quot;uta daiko&quot; are also featured in Noh performance.

Many taiko in Noh are also featured in kabuki performance and are used in a similar manner. In addition to the &quot;ō-tsuzumi&quot;, &quot;ko-tsuzumi&quot;, and &quot;nagauta-shime daiko&quot;, Kabuki performances make use of the larger &quot;ō-daiko&quot; offstage to help set the atmosphere for different scenes.

==Construction==

===Process===

Taiko construction has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning the skin to the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, &quot;byō-uchi-daiko&quot; were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; the texture of the wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.
The skins or heads of taiko are generally made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged about three or four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called &quot;byō&quot;, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; &quot;chū-daiko&quot; require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.

===Drum makers===
Several companies specialize in the production of taiko. One such company that created drums exclusively for the Emperor of Japan, Miyamoto Unosuke Shoten in Tokyo, has been making taiko since 1861. The Asano Taiko Corporation is another major taiko-producing organization, and has been producing taiko for over 400 years. The family-owned business started in Mattō, Ishikawa, and, aside from military equipment, made taiko for Noh theater and later expanded to creating instruments for festivals during the Meiji period. Asano currently maintains an entire complex of large buildings referred to as Asano Taiko Village, and the company reports producing up to 8000 drums each year. As of 2012, there is approximately one major taiko production company in each prefecture of Japan, with some regions having several companies. Of the manufacturers in Naniwa, Taikoya Matabē is one of the most successful and is thought to have brought considerable recognition to the community and attracted many drum makers there. Umetsu Daiko, a company that operates in Hakata, has been producing taiko since 1821.

==Performance==
Taiko performance styles vary widely across groups in terms of the number of performers, repertoire, instrument choices, and stage techniques. Nevertheless, a number of early groups have had broad influence on the tradition. For instance, many pieces developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.

===Form===
Kata is the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The notion is similar to that of kata in martial arts: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Shawn Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.

Some groups in Japan, particularly those active in Tokyo, also emphasize the importance of the lively and spirited &quot;iki&quot; aesthetic. In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the Edo period (1603–1868).
The sticks for playing taiko are called &quot;bachi&quot;, and are made in various sizes and from different kinds of wood such as white oak, bamboo, and Japanese magnolia. &quot;Bachi&quot; are also held in a number of different styles. In &quot;kumi-daiko&quot;, it is common for a player to hold their sticks in a relaxed manner between the V-shape of the index finger and thumb, which points to the player. There are other grips that allow performers to play much more technically difficult rhythms, such as the &quot;shime&quot; grip, which is similar to a matched grip: the &quot;bachi&quot; are gripped at the back end, and the fulcrum rests between the performer&#x27;s index finger and thumb, while the other fingers remain relaxed and slightly curled around the stick.

Performance in some groups is also guided by principles based on Zen Buddhism. For instance, among other concepts, the San Francisco Taiko Dojo is guided by emphasizing communication, respect, and harmony. The way the &quot;bachi&quot; are held can also be significant; for some groups, &quot;bachi&quot; represent a spiritual link between the body and the sky. Some physical parts of taiko, like the drum body, its skin, and the tacks also hold symbolic significance in Buddhism.

===Instrumentation===
&quot;Kumi-daiko&quot; groups consist primarily of percussive instruments where each of the drums plays a specific role. Of the different kinds of taiko, the most common in groups is the &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot;. &quot;Chū-daiko&quot; are common in taiko groups and represent the main rhythm of the group, whereas &quot;shime-daiko&quot; set and change tempo. A &quot;shime-daiko&quot; often plays the Jiuchi, a base rhythm holding together the ensemble. &quot;Ō-daiko&quot; provide a steady, underlying pulse and serve as a counter-rhythm to the other parts. It is common for performances to begin with a single stroke roll called an &quot;&quot;. The player starts slowly, leaving considerable space between strikes, gradually shortening the interval between hits, until the drummer is playing a rapid roll of hits. Oroshi are also played as a part of theatrical performance, such as in Noh theater.

Drums are not the only instruments played in the ensemble; other Japanese instruments are also used. Other kinds of percussion instruments include the , a hand-sized gong played with a small mallet. In kabuki, the shamisen, a plucked string instrument, often accompanies taiko during the theatrical performance. &quot;Kumi-daiko&quot; performances can also feature woodwinds such as the shakuhachi and the shinobue.

Voiced calls or shouts called kakegoe and kiai are also common in taiko performance. They are used as encouragement to other players or cues for transition or change in dynamics such as an increase in tempo. In contrast, the philosophical concept of ma, or the space between drum strikes, is also important in shaping rhythmic phrases and creating appropriate contrast.

===Clothing===
There is a wide variety of traditional clothing that players wear during taiko performance. Common in many &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; groups is the use of the happi, a decorative, thin-fabric coat, and traditional headbands called hachimaki. Tabi, , and are also typical. During his time with the group Ondekoza, Eitetsu Hayashi suggested that a loincloth called a fundoshi be worn when performing for French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who saw Ondekoza perform for him in 1975. The Japanese group Kodo has sometimes worn fundoshi for its performances.

==Education==
Taiko performance is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, such as in the 1512 encyclopedia called the &quot;Taigensho&quot;, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist William P. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.

Orally, patterns of onomatopoeia called kuchi shōga are taught from teacher to student that convey the rhythm and timbre of drum strikes for a particular piece. For example, represents a single strike to the center of the drum, where as represents two successive strikes, first by the right and then the left, and lasts the same amount of time as one &quot;don&quot; strike. Some taiko pieces, such as &quot;Yatai-bayashi&quot;, include patterns that are difficult to represent in Western musical notation. The exact words used can also differ from region to region.

More recently, Japanese publications have emerged in an attempt to standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote &quot;Japan Taiko&quot; with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi&#x27;s group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation&#x27;s scope.

The system of fundamentals &quot;Japan Taiko&quot; put forward was not widely adopted because taiko performance varied substantially across Japan. An updated 2001 publication from the Foundation, called the , describes regional variations that depart from the main techniques taught in the textbook. The creators of the text maintained that mastering a set of prescribed basics should be compatible with learning local traditions.

==Regional styles==
Aside from &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; performance, a number of folk traditions that use taiko have been recognized in different regions in Japan. Some of these include from Sado Island, &#x27; from the town of Kokura, and &#x27; from Iwate Prefecture.

===Eisa===
A variety of folk dances originating from Okinawa, known collectively as eisa, often make use of the taiko. Some performers use drums while dancing, and generally speaking, perform in one of two styles: groups on the Yokatsu Peninsula and on Hamahiga Island use small, single-sided drums called whereas groups near the city of Okinawa generally use &quot;shime-daiko&quot;. Use of &quot;shime-daiko&quot; over &quot;pāranku&quot; has spread throughout the island, and is considered the dominant style. Small &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot;, referred to as &quot;ō-daiko&quot; within the tradition, are also used and are worn in front of the performer. These drum dances are not limited to Okinawa and have appeared in places containing Okinawan communities such as in São Paulo, Hawaii, and large cities on the Japanese mainland.

===Hachijō-daiko===

 is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of &quot;Hachijō-daiko&quot; emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.

The &quot;Hachijō-daiko&quot; tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as &quot;a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around&quot;, and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan&#x27;s journal show features of &quot;Hachijō-daiko&quot;. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one.
The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called &quot;Kumaoji-daiko&quot;, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. &quot;Kumaoji-daiko&quot; has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. &quot;Kumaoji-daiko&quot; also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.

The contemporary style of &quot;Hachijō-daiko&quot; is called , which differs from &quot;Kumaoji-daiko&quot; in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, &quot;shin-daiko&quot; performances use larger drums exclusively on stands. &quot;Shin-daiko&quot; emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood. Looser clothing is worn by &quot;shin-daiko&quot; performers compared to kimono worn by &quot;Kumaoji-daiko&quot; performers; the looser clothing in &quot;shin-daiko&quot; allow performers to adopt more open stances and larger movements with the legs and arms. Rhythms used for the accompanying &quot;shita-byōshi&quot; role can also differ. One type of rhythm, called &quot;yūkichi&quot;, consists of the following: 

This rhythm is found in both styles, but is always played faster in &quot;shin-daiko&quot;. Another type of rhythm, called &quot;honbadaki&quot;, is unique to &quot;shin-daiko&quot; and also contains a song which is performed in standard Japanese.

===Miyake-daiko===
 is a style that has spread amongst groups through Kodo, and is formally known as . The word &quot;miyake&quot; comes from Miyake-jima, part of the Izu Islands, and the word &quot;Kamitsuki&quot; refers to the village where the tradition came from. Miyake-style taiko came out of performances for — a traditional festival held annually in July on Miyake Island since 1820 honoring the deity Gozu Tennō. In this festival, players perform on taiko while portable shrines are carried around town. The style itself is characterized in a number of ways. A &quot;nagadō-daiko&quot; is typically set low to the ground and played by two performers, one on each side; instead of sitting, performers stand and hold a stance that is also very low to the ground, almost to the point of kneeling.

==Outside Japan==

===Australia===
Taiko groups in Australia began forming in the 1990s. The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, was formed in 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei. TaikOz was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and Riley Lee, a former Ondekoza member, and has been performing in Australia since 1997. They are known for their work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes, and have a strong fan base. Cleworth and other members of the group have developed several original pieces.

===Brazil===
The introduction of &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; performance in Brazil can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s in São Paulo. Tangue Setsuko founded an eponymous taiko dojo and was Brazil&#x27;s first taiko group; Setsuo Kinoshita later formed the group Wadaiko Sho. Brazilian groups have combined native and African drumming techniques with taiko performance. One such piece developed by Kinoshita is called &quot;Taiko de Samba&quot;, which emphasizes both Brazilian and Japanese aesthetics in percussion traditions. Taiko was also popularized in Brazil from 2002 through the work of Yukihisa Oda, a Japanese native who visited Brazil several times through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

The Brazilian Association of Taiko (ABT) suggests that there are about 150 taiko groups in Brazil and that about 10–15% of players are non-Japanese; Izumo Honda, coordinator of a large annual festival in São Paulo, estimated that about 60% of all taiko performers in Brazil are women.

===North America===

Taiko emerged in the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar immigrant who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, a few members of Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976, and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.

Japanese-Canadian taiko began in 1979 with Katari Taiko, and was inspired by the San Jose Taiko group. Its early membership was predominantly female. Katari Taiko and future groups were thought to represent an opportunity for younger, third-generation Japanese Canadians to explore their roots, redevelop a sense of ethnic community, and expand taiko into other musical traditions.

There are no official counts or estimates of the number of active taiko groups in the United States or Canada, as there is no governing body for taiko groups in either country. Unofficial estimates have been made. In 1989, there were as many as 30 groups in the US and Canada, seven of which were in California. One estimate suggested that around 120 groups were active in the US and Canada as of 2001, many of which could be traced to the San Francisco Taiko Dojo; later estimates in 2005 and 2006 suggested there were about 200 groups in the United States alone.

The Cirque du Soleil shows &quot;Mystère&quot; in Las Vegas and &quot;Dralion&quot; have featured taiko performance. Taiko performance has also been featured in commercial productions such as the 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse ad campaign, and in events such as the 2009 Academy Awards and 2011 Grammy Awards.

From 2005 to 2006, the Japanese American National Museum held an exhibition called &quot;Big Drum: Taiko in the United States&quot;. The exhibition covered several topics related to taiko in the United States, such as the formation of performance groups, their construction using available materials, and social movements. Visitors were able to play smaller drums.

North America hosts the North American Taiko Conference (NATC) which has been ongoing since its inaugural conference in Los Angeles in 1997.
In 2013, the Taiko Community Alliance (TCA) formed as virtual nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with a mission to empower the people and advance the art of taiko. The Taiko Community Alliance has been responsible for helping organize the NATC conferences to help further its mission of educating and raising awareness of taiko through the taiko community.

===Italy===

The first group, called Quelli del Taiko, was formed in 2000 by Pietro Notarnicola. They played in World Premiere - 2017 - &quot;On Western Terror 8&quot; - Concerto for Taiko Ensemble and Orchestra of the Italian composed Luigi Morleo

=== United Kingdom ===
Kagemusha Taiko based in the south-west were formed in 1999 by Jonathan Kirby and perform original pieces of their own creation. They are known for their work in schools and have performed in several UK venues as well as the USA and Japan.

==Related cultural and social movements==
Certain peoples have used taiko to advance social or cultural movements, both within Japan and elsewhere in the world.

===Gender conventions===
Taiko performance has frequently been viewed as an art form dominated by men. Historians of taiko argue that its performance comes from masculine traditions. Those who developed ensemble-style taiko in Japan were men, and through the influence of Ondekoza, the ideal taiko player was epitomized in images of the masculine peasant class, particularly through the character Muhōmatsu in the 1958 film &quot;Rickshaw Man&quot;. Masculine roots have also been attributed to perceived capacity for &quot;spectacular bodily performance&quot; where women&#x27;s bodies are sometimes judged as unable to meet the physical demands of playing.

Before the 1980s, it was uncommon for Japanese women to perform on traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted; an exception was the San Francisco Taiko Dojo under the guidance of Grandmaster Seiichi Tanaka, who was the first to admit women to the art form. In Ondekoza and in the early performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances. Thereafter, female participation in &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group&#x27;s apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play &quot;as women&quot;. Other women in the apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.

Female taiko performance has also served as a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale. Through performance, some groups believe they are helping to redefine not only the role of women in taiko, but how women are perceived more generally.

===Burakumin===

Those involved in the construction of taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.

The , representing the contributions of burakumin, is found in Naniwa Ward in Osaka, home to a large proportion of burakumin. Among other features, the road contains taiko-shaped benches representing their traditions in taiko manufacturing and leatherworking, and their influence on national culture. The road ends at the Osaka Human Rights Museum, which exhibits the history of systematic discrimination against the burakumin. The road and museum were developed in part due an advocacy campaign led by the Buraku Liberation League and a taiko group of younger performers called .

===North American &quot;sansei&quot;===
Taiko performance was an important part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called &quot;sansei&quot;. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called &quot;nisei&quot; faced internment in the United States and in Canada on the basis of their race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the civil rights movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, performance was meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.

==Notable performers and groups==

A number of performers and groups, including several early leaders, have been recognized for their contributions to taiko performance. Daihachi Oguchi was best known for developing &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; performance. Oguchi founded the first &quot;kumi-daiko&quot; group called Osuwa Daiko in 1951, and facilitated the popularization of taiko performance groups in Japan.

Seidō Kobayashi is the leader of the Tokyo-based taiko group Oedo Sukeroku Taiko as of December 2014. Kobayashi founded the group in 1959 and was the first group to tour professionally. Kobayashi is considered a master performer of taiko. He is also known for asserting intellectual control of the group&#x27;s performance style, which has influenced performance for many groups, particularly in North America.

In 1968, Seiichi Tanaka founded the San Francisco Taiko Dojo and is regarded as the Grandfather of Taiko and primary developer of taiko performance in the United States. He was a recipient of a 2001 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts and since 2013 is the only taiko professional presented with the Order of the Rising Sun 5th Order: Gold and Silver Rays by Emperor Akihito of Japan, in recognition of Grandmaster Seiichi Tanaka&#x27;s contributions to the fostering of US-Japan relations as well as the promotion of Japanese cultural understanding in the United States.

In 1969, founded Ondekoza, a group well known for making taiko performance internationally visible and for its artistic contributions to the tradition. Den was also known for developing a communal living and training facility for Ondekoza on Sado Island in Japan, which had a reputation for its intensity and broad education programs in folklore and music.

Performers and groups beyond the early practitioners have also been noted. Eitetsu Hayashi is best known for his solo performance work. When he was 19, Hayashi joined Ondekoza, a group later expanded and re-founded as Kodo, one of the best known and most influential taiko performance groups in the world. Hayashi soon left the group to begin a solo career and has performed in venues such as Carnegie Hall in 1984, the first featured taiko performer there. He was awarded the 47th Education Minister&#x27;s Art Encouragement Prize, a national award, in 1997 as well as the 8th Award for the Promotion of Traditional Japanese Culture from the Japan Arts Foundation in 2001.

<text>Dolly Rebecca Parton (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and philanthropist, known primarily as a country musician. After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton released her debut album in 1967 with &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Dolly&quot;, commencing a career spanning 60 years and 49 studio albums, including 2023&#x27;s &quot;Rockstar&quot;, which became her highest-charting &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album, peaking at number-three.

Described as a &quot;country legend&quot;, Parton has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Her music includes Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 singles reach No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with Reba McEntire). She has 44 career Top10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career-charted singles over the past 40 years. Parton has composed over 3,000 songs, including &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, and an international hit for Whitney Houston), &quot;Jolene&quot;, &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, and &quot;9to5&quot;. As an actress, she has starred in the films &quot;9to5&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982), for each of which she earned Best Actress Golden Globe nominations, as well as &quot;Rhinestone&quot; (1984), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), &quot;Straight Talk&quot; (1992), and &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; (2012).

Parton has received various accolades, including 11 Grammy Awards from 50 nominations. She has won ten Country Music Association Awards, including Entertainer of the Year, being one of seven female artists to achieve it. Parton has five Academy of Country Music Awards (including Entertainer of the Year), four People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and three American Music Awards. She is also in a select group to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, and Emmy Awards. In 2005, Parton received the National Medal of Arts. She was the second woman to be inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Outside of her work in the music and film industries, she also co-owns The Dollywood Company, which manages a number of entertainment venues including the Dollywood theme park, the Splash Country water park, and a number of dinner theatre venues such as The Dolly Parton Stampede and Pirates Voyage. She has founded a number of charitable and philanthropic organizations, chief among them being the Dollywood Foundation, who manage a number of projects to bring education and poverty relief to East Tennessee, where she was raised.

==Early life and career==
Dolly Rebecca Parton was born on January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the Little Pigeon River in Pittman Center, Tennessee. 
She is the fourth of 12 children born to Avie Lee Caroline (née Owens; 1923–2003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921–2000). Parton&#x27;s middle name comes from her maternal great-great-grandmother Rebecca (née Dunn) Whitted. Parton&#x27;s father, known as &quot;Lee&quot;, worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a sharecropper and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm&#x27;s small income. Despite her father&#x27;s illiteracy, Parton has often commented that he was one of the smartest people she has ever known with regard to business and making a profit.

Parton&#x27;s mother cared for their large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Parton attributes her musical abilities to the influence of her mother; often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with Smoky Mountain folklore and ancient ballads. Having Welsh ancestors, Avie Lee knew many old ballads that immigrants from the British Isles brought to southern Appalachia in the 18th and 19th century. Avie Lee&#x27;s father, Jake Owens, was a Pentecostal preacher, and Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother&#x27;s family for her musical abilities. When Parton was a young girl, her family moved from the Pittman Center area to a farm up on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there. Today, a replica of the Locust Ridge cabin resides at Parton&#x27;s namesake theme park Dollywood. The farm acreage and surrounding woodland inspired her to write the song &quot;My Tennessee Mountain Home&quot; in the 1970s. Years after the farm was sold, Parton bought it back in the late 1980s. Her brother Bobby helped with building restoration and new construction.

Parton has described her family as being &quot;dirt poor&quot;. Parton&#x27;s father paid missionary Dr. Robert F. Thomas with a sack of cornmeal for delivering her. Parton would write a song about Dr. Thomas when she was grown. She also outlined her family&#x27;s poverty in her early songs &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; and &quot;In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)&quot;. For six or seven years, Parton and her family lived in their rustic, one-bedroom cabin on their small subsistence farm on Locust Ridge. This was a predominantly Pentecostal area located north of the Greenbrier Valley of the Great Smoky Mountains.
Music played an important role in her early life. She was brought up in the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), in a congregation her grandfather, Jake Robert Owens, pastored. Her earliest public performances were in the church, beginning at age six. At seven, she started playing a homemade guitar. When she was eight, her uncle bought her first real guitar. The Parton family was well-fed despite their poverty, and the 2024 cookbook &quot;Good Lookin&#x27; Cookin&quot;&#x27; (co-written by her with her sister Rachel) recalls numerous family meals.

Parton began performing as a child, singing on local radio and television programs in the East Tennessee area. By ten, she was appearing on &quot;The Cas Walker Show&quot; on both WIVK Radio and WBIR-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee. At 13, she was recording (the single &quot;Puppy Love&quot;) on a small Louisiana label, Goldband Records, and appeared at the Grand Ole Opry, where she first met Johnny Cash, who encouraged her to follow her own instincts regarding her career.
After graduating from Sevier County High School in 1964, Parton moved to Nashville the next day. Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival; with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two Top10 hits for Bill Phillips: &quot;Put It Off Until Tomorrow,&quot; and &quot;The Company You Keep&quot; (1966), and Skeeter Davis&#x27;s number 11 hit &quot;Fuel to the Flame&quot; (1967). Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including Kitty Wells and Hank Williams Jr. She signed with Monument Records in 1965, at age 19; she initially was pitched as a bubblegum pop singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, &quot;Happy, Happy Birthday Baby&quot;, did not crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique, high soprano voice was not suited to the genre.

After her composition &quot;Put It Off Until Tomorrow&quot;, as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, &quot;Dumb Blonde&quot; (composed by Curly Putman, one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by &quot;Something Fishy&quot;, which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Dolly&quot;.

==Music career==
===1967–1975: Country music success===

In 1967, musician and country music entertainer Porter Wagoner invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly syndicated television program &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot;, and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography, initially, much of Wagoner&#x27;s audience was unhappy that Norma Jean, the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience). With Wagoner&#x27;s assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, RCA Victor, to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a duet with Wagoner. That song, a remake of Tom Paxton&#x27;s &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, released in late 1967, reached the country Top10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted Top10 singles for the pair.

Parton&#x27;s first solo single for RCA Victor, &quot;Just Because I&#x27;m a Woman&quot;, was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the next two years, none of her solo effortseven &quot;In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)&quot;, which later became a standardwere as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named Vocal Group of the Year in 1968 by the Country Music Association, but Parton&#x27;s solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par, the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.

By 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Mule Skinner Blues&quot;, a gimmick that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, &quot;Joshua&quot;. For the next two years, she had numerous solo hitsincluding her signature song &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; (number four, 1971)in addition to her duets. Top20 singles included &quot;The Right Combination&quot; and &quot;Burning the Midnight Oil&quot; (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); &quot;Lost Forever in Your Kiss&quot; (with Wagoner), &quot;Touch Your Woman&quot; (1972), &quot;My Tennessee Mountain Home&quot; and &quot;Travelin&#x27; Man&quot; (1973).

Although her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was &quot;Jolene&quot;. Released in late 1973, the song topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100 (it eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton&#x27;s first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner&#x27;s organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated. He helped produce her records through 1975. The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975&#x27;s &quot;Say Forever You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;.

In 1974, her song, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country chart. Around the same time, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley. Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 (&quot;Jolene&quot;, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;Love Is Like a Butterfly&quot;), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Stop Loving Me&quot;. In a 2019 episode of the Sky Arts music series &quot;Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road&quot;, Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she had composed both &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson &quot;Buddy, that was a good night.&quot; Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with &quot;The Bargain Store&quot;.

===1976–1986: Pop transition===

Between 1974 and 1980, Parton had a series of country hits, with eight singles reaching number one. Her influence on pop culture is reflected by the many performers covering her songs, including mainstream and crossover artists such as Olivia Newton-John, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt.

Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with Sandy Gallin, who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album &quot;All I Can Do&quot;, which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, &quot;New Harvest...First Gathering&quot; (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&amp;B classics &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; – and production. Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single &quot;Light of a Clear Blue Morning&quot; made much of an impression on the pop charts.

After &quot;New Harvest&quot; disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer Gary Klein for her next album. The result, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil-penned title track topped the country singles chart, and became Parton&#x27;s first Top10 single on the pop chart (no.3). A second single, the double A-sided &quot;Two Doors Down&quot;/&quot;It&#x27;s All Wrong, But It&#x27;s All Right&quot; topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-crossover success.
In 1978, Parton won a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; album. She continued to have hits with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (1978), &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Burning&quot; (1979) and &quot;You&#x27;re the Only One&quot; (1979)all of which charted in the pop Top 40 and topped the country chart. &quot;Sweet Summer Lovin&#x27;&quot; (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a &quot;Barbara Walters Special&quot; in 1977 (timed to coincide with &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on Cher&#x27;s ABC television special, and her own joint special with Carol Burnett on CBS, &quot;Dolly &amp; Carol in Nashville&quot;.

Parton served as one of three co-hosts (along with Roy Clark and Glen Campbell) on the CBS special &quot;Fifty Years of Country Music&quot;. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special &quot;The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music&quot;, performed live at the Ford Theatre in Washington, D.C., and whose audience included President Jimmy Carter.
Her commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the Donna Summer-written &quot;Starting Over Again&quot;, &quot;Old Flames Can&#x27;t Hold a Candle to You&quot;, and &quot;9to5&quot;, which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981. She had another Top10 single that year with &quot;Making Plans&quot;, a single released from a 1980 album with Porter Wagoner, released as part of a lawsuit settlement between the pair.
The theme song to the 1980 feature film &quot;9to5&quot;, in which she starred along with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, not only reached number one on the country chartin February 1981 it reached number one on the pop and the adult-contemporary charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had twelve Top10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, from the feature film &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982) scraped the Top50 that year and her duet with Kenny Rogers, &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (written by the Bee Gees and produced by Barry Gibb), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.

In the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;Tennessee Homesick Blues&quot;, &quot;God Won&#x27;t Get You&quot; (1984), &quot;Real Love&quot; (another duet with Kenny Rogers), &quot;Don&#x27;t Call It Love&quot; (1985) and &quot;Think About Love&quot; (1986) all reaching the country Top10 (&quot;Tennessee Homesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Think About Love&quot; reached number one; &quot;Real Love&quot; also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired in 1986, and she signed with Columbia Records in 1987.

===1987–2005: Country and bluegrass period===
Along with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, she released &quot;Trio&quot; (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton&#x27;s music career, spending five weeks at number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Country Albums chart, and also reached the Top10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top10 country hits, including Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot;, which went to number one. &quot;Trio&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After a further attempt at pop success with &quot;Rainbow&quot; (1987), including the single &quot;The River Unbroken&quot;, it ended up a commercial let-down, causing Parton to focus on recording country material. &quot;White Limozeen&quot; (1989) produced two number one hits in &quot;Why&#x27;d You Come in Here Lookin&#x27; Like That&quot; and &quot;Yellow Roses&quot;. Although Parton&#x27;s career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.
A duet with Ricky Van Shelton, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Years&quot; (1991) reached number one, though Parton&#x27;s greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for the soundtrack of the feature film &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton&#x27;s soundtrack album from the 1992 film, &quot;Straight Talk&quot;, however, was less successful. But her 1993 album &quot;Slow Dancing with the Moon&quot; won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It would also become Platinum certified. She recorded &quot;The Day I Fall in Love&quot; as a duet with James Ingram for the feature film &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot; (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, Carole Bayer Sager, and Clif Magness) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot; in the fall of 1993 with Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette. It was certified as a gold album by the Recording Industry Association of America and helped revive both Wynette and Lynn&#x27;s careers. Also in 1994, Parton contributed the song &quot;You Gotta Be My Baby&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. A live acoustic album, &quot;&quot;, featuring stripped-down versions of some of her hits, as well as some traditional songs, was released in late 1994.

Parton&#x27;s recorded music during the mid-to-late-1990s remained steady and somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (performed as a duet with Vince Gill), from her album &quot;Something Special&quot; won the Country Music Association&#x27;s Vocal Event of the Year Award. The following year, &quot;Treasures&quot;, an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by Mac Davis, Pete Seeger, Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, and Neil Young. Her recording of Stevens&#x27; &quot;Peace Train&quot; was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching &quot;Billboard&#x27;s &quot;dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album &quot;Hungry Again&quot; was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;(Why Don&#x27;t More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs&quot; and &quot;Salt in my Tears&quot;, charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on CMT. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, &quot;Trio II&quot;, was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Parton also was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999.

Parton recorded a series of bluegrass-inspired albums, beginning with &quot;The Grass Is Blue&quot; (1999), winning a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album; and &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; (2001), with its cover of Collective Soul&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot; winning a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The third, &quot;Halos &amp; Horns&quot; (2002) included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. In 2005, she released &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; consisting of her interpretations of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;, &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, and &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;

===2005–2020: Touring and holiday album===

Parton earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for &quot;Travelin&#x27; Thru&quot;, which she wrote specifically for the feature film &quot;Transamerica&quot;. (2005) Due to the song&#x27;s (and film&#x27;s) acceptance of a transgender woman, Parton received death threats. She returned to number one on the country chart later in 2005 by lending her distinctive harmonies to the Brad Paisley ballad, &quot;When I Get Where I&#x27;m Going&quot;. In September 2007, Parton released her first single from her own record company, Dolly Records, titled, &quot;Better Get to Livin&#x27;&quot;, which eventually peaked at number 48 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. It was followed by the studio album &quot;Backwoods Barbie&quot;, which was released on February 26, 2008, and reached number two on the country chart. The album&#x27;s debut at number 17 on the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart was the highest in her career. &quot;Backwoods Barbie&quot; produced four additional singles, including the title track, written as part of her score for &quot;9to5: The Musical&quot;, an adaptation of her feature film. After the death of Michael Jackson, whom Parton knew personally, she released a video in which she somberly told of her feelings on Jackson and his death.
On October 27, 2009, Parton released a four-CD box set, &quot;Dolly&quot;, which featured 99 songs and spanned most of her career. She released her second live DVD and album, &quot;Live From London&quot; in October 2009, which was filmed during her sold-out 2008 concerts at London&#x27;s The O2 Arena.

In 2011, Parton voiced the character Dolly Gnome in the animated film &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;. On February 11, 2012, after the sudden death of Whitney Houston, Parton stated, &quot;Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song, and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, &#x27;Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.

In 2013, Parton joined Lulu Roman for a re-recording of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for Roman&#x27;s album, &quot;At Last&quot;. In 2013, Parton and Kenny Rogers reunited for the title song of his album &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make Old Friends&quot;.

===Since 2022: Rock album===
In early 2022, Parton was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Parton initially declined the nomination believing that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was &quot;for the people in rock music&quot;, but after learning that this was not the case Parton said she would accept her induction if she were chosen for the honor. In May her induction was announced, and finally on November 5, 2022, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In October 2022 Parton stated in an interview that she would no longer tour, but would continue to play live shows occasionally. On December 31, 2022, Parton co-hosted NBC&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s special &quot;Miley&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve Party.&quot;

On January 17, 2023, Parton announced she would release her first rock album, titled &quot;Rockstar&quot;, later that year, during an interview on &quot;The View&quot;. Lead single &quot;World on Fire&quot; was released on May 11, 2023. It went on to peak at number 1 a week later.

The song was written by Diane Warren, and performed by Dolly Parton, Belinda Carlisle, Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Harry and Gloria Estefan. The official music video shows Parton, Carlisle, Lauper, and Estefan performing while wearing football jerseys similar to the ones worn by the women in the film, interspersed with clips from the film.

==Public image==

Parton had turned down several offers to pose nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, but did appear on the cover of the October 1978 issue wearing a Playboy bunny outfit, complete with ears (the issue featured Lawrence Grobel&#x27;s extensive and candid interview with Parton, representing one of her earliest high-profile interviews with the mainstream press). The association of breasts with Parton&#x27;s public image is illustrated in the naming of Dolly the sheep after her, since the sheep was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe&#x27;s mammary gland. In Mobile, Alabama, the General W.K. Wilson Jr. Bridge is commonly called &quot;the Dolly Parton Bridge&quot; due to its arches resembling her bust. The thickened appearance of the turret frontal armor of the T-72A main battle tank led to the unofficial Army nickname &quot;Dolly Parton&quot; – and later the T-72BIs got the &quot;Super Dolly Parton&quot; nickname.

Parton is known for having undergone considerable plastic surgery. On a 2003 episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, Winfrey asked what kind of cosmetic surgery Parton had undergone. Parton replied that cosmetic surgery was imperative in keeping with her famous image.
Parton has repeatedly joked about her physical image and surgeries, saying, &quot;It takes a lot of money to look this cheap.&quot; Her breasts have garnered her mentions in several songs, including &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Hits&quot; by Bobby Braddock, &quot;Marty Feldman Eyes&quot; by Bruce Baum (a parody of &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;), &quot;No Show Jones&quot; by George Jones and Merle Haggard, and &quot;Make Me Proud&quot; by Drake, featuring Nicki Minaj. When asked about future plastic surgeries, she famously said, &quot;If I see something sagging, bagging or dragging, I&#x27;ll get it nipped, tucked or sucked.&quot; Parton&#x27;s feminine escapism is acknowledged in her words, &quot;Womanhood was a difficult thing to get a grip on in those hills, unless you were a man.&quot; Parton said in 2012 that she had entered a Dolly Parton drag queen lookalike contest and lost.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Parton, though influenced by big name stars, often credits much of her inspiration to her family and community. On her own mother Parton, in her 2020 book &quot;Songteller: My Life in Lyrics&quot;, wrote &quot;So it was just natural for my mom to always be singing. My mother had that old-timey voice, and she used to sing all these songs that were brought over from the Old World. They were English, Irish, Welsh, folk songs where people tell stories.&quot; Parton calls her mother&#x27;s voice &quot;haunting&quot;. &quot;Lord you would feel it&quot;, she wrote. Her biggest influence however was her Aunt Dorothy Jo: &quot;People often ask me who my influences were, they think I&#x27;m going to say some big names, and there were a few &#x27;stars&#x27; I was impressed with. But my hero was my aunt Dorothy Jo. Mama&#x27;s baby sister. She was not only an evangelist, she played banjo, she played guitar, and she wrote some great songs.&quot; Fellow singers also had an impact on Parton, describing George Jones as her &quot;all time favorite singer&quot;, and recognizing her love for other artists such as Kitty Wells, Roy Acuff, and Rose Maddox.

===Musicianship===
Though unable to read sheet music, Parton can play many instruments, including: the dulcimer, autoharp, banjo, guitar, electric guitar, fiddle, piano, recorder, and the saxophone. Reflecting on her multi-instrumental abilities, Parton said, &quot;I play some of everything. I ain&#x27;t that good at none of it, but I try to sell it. I really try to lay into it.&quot; Parton has also used her fingernails as an instrument, most evident on her 1980 song &quot;9 to 5&quot;, which she derived the beat from clacking her nails together while backstage on the set of the film &quot;9 to 5&quot;.

==Other ventures==
In 1998, &quot;Nashville Business&quot; ranked her the wealthiest country music star. , her net worth is estimated at $500million.

===Songwriting===
Parton is a prolific songwriter, having begun by writing country music songs with strong elements of folk music, based on her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings and reflecting her family&#x27;s Christian background. Her songs &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, and &quot;Jolene&quot;, among others, have become classics. On November 4, 2003, Parton was honored as a BMI Icon at the 2003 BMI Country Awards.
Parton has earned over 35 BMI Pop and Country Awards. In 2001, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In a 2009 interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, she said she had written &quot;at least 3,000&quot; songs, having written seriously since the age of seven. Parton also said she writes something every day, be it a song or an idea.

Parton&#x27;s songwriting has been featured prominently in several films. In addition to the title song for &quot;9to5&quot;, she also recorded a second version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982). The second version was a number one country hit and also reached number 53 on the pop charts.
&quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on &quot;Prisoner In Disguise&quot; (1975), Kenny Rogers on &quot;Vote for Love&quot; (1996), and LeAnn Rimes on &quot;Unchained Melody: The Early Years&quot; (1997). Whitney Houston performed it on &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack and her version became the best-selling hit both written and performed by a female vocalist, with worldwide sales of over twelve million copies. In addition, the song has been translated into Italian and performed by the Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins.

As a songwriter, Parton has twice been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, for &quot;9 to 5&quot; and &quot;Travelin&#x27; Thru&quot; (2005) from the film &quot;Transamerica&quot;. &quot;Travelin&#x27; Thru&quot; won Best Original Song at the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards. It was also nominated for both the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the 2005 Broadcast Film Critics Association Award (also known as the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards) for Best Song. A cover of &quot;Love Is Like A Butterfly&quot; by Clare Torry was used as the theme music for the British TV show &quot;Butterflies&quot;.

===Stage musicals===

==== &quot;9 to 5: The Musical&quot; ====

Parton wrote the score (and Patricia Resnick the book) for &quot;9 to 5: The Musical&quot;, a musical-theater adaptation of Parton&#x27;s feature film &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980). The musical ran at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, in late 2008. It opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in New York on April 30, 2009, to mixed reviews.
The title track of her 2008 album &quot;Backwoods Barbie&quot; was written for the musical&#x27;s character Doralee. Although her score (as well as the musical debut of actress Allison Janney) was praised, the show struggled, closing on September 6, 2009, after 24 previews and 148 performances. Parton received nominations for Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics as well as a nomination for Tony Award for Best Original Score.
Developing the musical was not a quick process. According to the public-radio program &quot;Studio 360&quot; (October 29, 2005), in October 2005 Parton was in the midst of composing songs for a Broadway musical theater adaptation of the film. In late June 2007, &quot;9 to 5: The Musical&quot; was read for industry presentations. The readings starred Megan Hilty, Allison Janney, Stephanie J. Block, Bebe Neuwirth, and Marc Kudisch. Ambassador Theatre Group announced a 2012 UK tour for &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s 9to5: The Musical&quot;, commencing at Manchester Opera House, on October 12, 2012.

She is a co-owner of The Dollywood Company, which operates the theme park Dollywood (a former Silver Dollar City), a dinner theater, Dolly Parton&#x27;s Stampede, the waterpark Dollywood&#x27;s Splash Country, and the Dream More Resort and Spa, all in Pigeon Forge. Dollywood is the 24th-most-popular theme park in the United States, with three million visitors per year.
The Dolly Parton&#x27;s Stampede business has venues in Branson, Missouri, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A former location in Orlando, Florida, closed in January 2008 after the land and building were sold to a developer. Starting in June 2011, the Myrtle Beach location became Pirates Voyage Fun, Feast and Adventure; Parton appeared for the opening, and the South Carolina General Assembly declared June 3, 2011, as Dolly Parton Day.

On January 19, 2012, Parton&#x27;s 66th birthday, Gaylord Opryland and Dollywood announced plans to open a $50million water and snow park, a family-friendly destination in Nashville that is open all year.

In a 2009 interview, singer Connie Francis revealed that Parton had been contacting her for years in an attempt to film the singer&#x27;s life story. Francis turned down Parton&#x27;s offers, as she was already in negotiations with singer Gloria Estefan to produce the film, a collaboration now ended. After the retirement of her partner, Sandy Gallin, Parton briefly operated Dolly Parton&#x27;s Southern Light Productions and in 2015 she announced her new production company would be called Dixie Pixie Productions and produce the movies-of-week in development with NBC Television and Magnolia Hill Productions.

==Acting career==
===Acting breakthrough===
In addition to her performing appearances on &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot; in the 1960s and into the 1970s, her two self-titled television variety shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and on &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2008 and other guest appearances, Parton has had television roles. In 1979, she received an Emmy award nomination as &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Program&quot; for her guest appearance in a Cher special. During the mid-1970s, Parton wanted to expand her audience base. Although her first attempt, the television variety show &quot;Dolly!&quot; (1976–77), had high ratings, it lasted only one season, with Parton requesting to be released from her contract because of the stress it was causing on her vocal cords. (She later tried a second television variety show, also titled &quot;Dolly&quot; (1987–88); it too lasted only one season).

In her first feature film, Parton portrayed a secretary in a leading role with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in the comedy film &quot;9to5&quot; (1980). The movie highlights discrimination against women in the workplace and created awareness of the National Association of Working Women (9–5). She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy and a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. Parton wrote and recorded the film&#x27;s title song. It received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

It also reached no.1 on the Hot 100 chart and it was no.78 on the &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs&quot; list released by the American Film Institute in 2004. &quot;9 to 5&quot; became a major box office success, grossing over $3.9million its opening weekend, and over $103million worldwide. Parton was named Top Female Box Office Star by the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; in both 1981 and 1982 due to the film&#x27;s success.

In late 1981, Parton began filming her second film, the musical film &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982). The film earned her a second nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best ActressMotion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was greeted with positive critical reviews and became a commercial success, earning over $69million worldwide. After a two-year hiatus from films, Parton was teamed with Sylvester Stallone for &quot;Rhinestone&quot; (1984). A comedy film about a country music star&#x27;s efforts to mould an unknown into a music sensation, the film was a critical and financial failure, making just over $21million on a $28million budget.

In 1989, Parton returned to film acting in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), based on the play &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; by Robert Harling.

She starred with James Woods in &quot;Straight Talk&quot; (1992), which received mixed reviews, and grossed a mild $21million at the box office.

Parton&#x27;s 1987 variety show &quot;Dolly&quot; lasted only one season. She made a cameo appearance as herself in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993), an adaptation of the long-running TV sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971). Parton has done voice work for animation for television series, playing herself in &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; (episode &quot;Urban Chipmunk&quot;, 1983) and the character Katrina Eloise &quot;Murph&quot; Murphy (Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s first cousin) in &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; (episode &quot;The Family Holiday Special&quot;, 1994). She also has guest-starred in several sitcoms, including a 1990 episode of &quot;Designing Women&quot; (episode &quot;The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century&quot;) as herself, the guardian movie star of Charlene&#x27;s baby. She made a guest appearance on &quot;Reba&quot; (episode &quot;Reba&#x27;s Rules of Real Estate&quot;) portraying a real-estate agency owner and on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (episode &quot;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&quot;, 1999).

She made cameo appearances on the Disney Channel as &quot;Aunt Dolly&quot;, visiting Hannah and her family in fellow Tennessean and real-life goddaughter Miley Cyrus&#x27;s series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; (episodes &quot;Good Golly, Miss Dolly&quot;, 2006, &quot;I Will Always Loathe You&quot;, 2007, and &quot;Kiss It All Goodbye&quot;, 2010). She was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

(2002) She made a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot;, starring Sandra Bullock. She was featured in &quot;The Book Lady&quot; (2008), a documentary about her campaign for children&#x27;s literacy. Parton expected to reprise her television role as Hannah&#x27;s godmother in the musical comedy film &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot; (2009), but the character was omitted from the screenplay.

===Since 2010===
Parton had a voice role in the comedy family film &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (2011), an animated film with garden gnomes about William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. She co-starred with Queen Latifah in the musical film &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; (2012), playing a choir director&#x27;s widow who joins forces with Latifah&#x27;s character, a mother of two teens, to save a small Georgia town&#x27;s gospel choir. &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Coat of Many Colors&quot;, a made-for-TV film based on Parton&#x27;s song &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, and featuring narration by Parton, aired on NBC in December 2015, with child actress Alyvia Alyn Lind portraying the young Parton. Parton also had a cameo in the sequel, which aired in November 2016.

In June 2018, Parton announced an eight-part Netflix series, featuring her music career. She is its executive producer and co-star. The series, called &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Heartstrings&quot;, aired in November 2019. Parton is the subject of the NPR podcast &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s America&quot;. It is hosted by Jad Abumrad, who also hosts Radiolab. In December 2019, the biographical documentary &quot;Here I Am&quot; was added to the catalog of the Netflix streaming service. The documentary, a co-production of Netflix and the BBC, takes its name from Parton&#x27;s 1971 song.

In November 2020, Parton produced and starred in the Netflix musical film &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Christmas on the Square&quot;, which won her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Parton is the fourth of 12 children. Her siblings are Willadeene, David Wilburn (1942–2024), Coy Denver, Robert Lee (Bobby), Stella Mae, Cassie Nan, Randle Huston (Randy; 1953–2021), Larry Gerald (born and died July 6, 1955), twins Floyd Estel (1957–2018) and Frieda Estelle, and Rachel Ann.

On May 30, 1966, Parton and Carl Thomas Dean (born July 20, 1942, in Nashville, Tennessee) were married in Ringgold, Georgia. Although Parton does not use Dean&#x27;s surname professionally, she has stated that her passport reads &quot;Dolly Parton Dean&quot;, and she sometimes uses Dean when signing contracts.
Dean, who is retired from running an asphalt road-paving business in Nashville, has always shunned publicity, and rarely accompanies his wife to any events. Parton has jokingly said that he has only seen her perform once. She also has said in interviews that even though it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean&#x27;s romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her, and sometimes even writes poems for her. In 2011, Parton said, &quot;We&#x27;re really very proud of our marriage. It&#x27;s the first for both of us. And the last.&quot;

On May 6, 2016, Parton announced that she and Dean would renew their vows in honor of their 50th wedding anniversary later in the month.

While Parton has never had children, she and Dean helped raise several of her younger siblings in Nashville, leading her nieces and nephews to refer to them as &quot;Uncle Peepaw&quot; and &quot;Aunt Granny&quot;; the latter a moniker that later lent its name to one of Parton&#x27;s Dollywood restaurants. 
Parton is also the godmother of singer-songwriter and actress Miley Cyrus.

===Faith===
Parton says that she is a committed Christian, which has influenced many of her musical releases.

She talked about her liberal approach to faith in the January 2024 issue of &quot;New Humanist&quot; magazine. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t even say I&#x27;m religious, though I grew up with that background. But I have a lot of faith in myself and I&#x27;ve been so blessed to have been around great people my whole life, my Uncle Bill and my family being supportive, and all the people I met along the way.&quot;
==Philanthropy==
Since the mid-1980s, Parton has supported many charitable efforts, particularly in the area of literacy, primarily through her Dollywood Foundation.
Her literacy program, Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library, which is a part of the Dollywood Foundation, was founded in honor of her father, who never learned to read or write. It mails one book per month to each enrolled child from the time of their birth until they enter kindergarten. Currently, over 1600 local communities provide the Imagination Library to almost 850,000 children each month across the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland. In February 2018, she donated her 100 millionth free book, a copy of Parton&#x27;s children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and was honored by the Library of Congress on account of the &quot;charity sending out its 100 millionth book&quot;.

For her work in literacy, Parton has received various awards, including Association of American Publishers Honors Award (2000), Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval (2001) (the first time the seal had been awarded to a person), American Association of School AdministratorsGalaxy Award (2002), National State Teachers of the YearChasing Rainbows Award (2002), and Parents as Teachers National CenterChild and Family Advocacy Award (2003).

On May 8, 2009, Parton gave the commencement speech at the graduation ceremony for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences. During the ceremony, she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university. It was only the second honorary degree given by the university, and in presenting the degree, the university&#x27;s Chancellor, Jimmy Cheek, said, &quot;Because of her career not just as a musician and entertainer, but for her role as a cultural ambassador, philanthropist and lifelong advocate for education, it is fitting that she be honored with an honorary degree from the flagship educational institution of her home state.&quot;

In 2006, Parton published a cookbook, &quot;Dolly&#x27;s Dixie Fixin&#x27;s: Love, Laughter and Lots of Good Food&quot;.

The Dollywood Foundation, funded from Parton&#x27;s profits, has been noted for bringing jobs and tax revenues to a previously depressed region. Parton also has worked to raise money for several other causes, including the American Red Cross and HIV/AIDS-related charities.

In December 2006, Parton pledged $500,000 toward a proposed $90million hospital and cancer center to be constructed in Sevierville in the name of Robert F. Thomas, the physician who delivered her. She announced a benefit concert to raise additional funds for the project. The concert played to about 8,000 people. That same year, Parton and Emmylou Harris allowed use of their music in a PETA ad campaign that encouraged pet owners to keep their dogs indoors rather than chained outside.
In 2003, her efforts to preserve the bald eagle through the American Eagle Foundation&#x27;s sanctuary at Dollywood earned her the Partnership Award from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Parton received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution at a ceremony in Nashville on November 8, 2007.

In response to the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, Parton was one of a number of country music artists who participated in a telethon to raise money for victims of the fires. This was held in Nashville on December 9. In addition, Parton hosted her own telethon for the victims on December 13 and reportedly raised around $9million. Her fund, the &quot;My People Fund&quot;, provided $1,000 a month for six months to over 900 families affected by the wildfires, finally culminating with $5,000 to each home in the final month due to increased fundraising, for a total of $10,000 per family. In 2018, the FBI honored Parton for her wildfire aid work, awarding her the 2018 Director&#x27;s Community Leadership Award at a ceremony at FBI Headquarters in Washington. The honor was bestowed by Director Christopher Wray and was accepted on Parton&#x27;s behalf by David Dotson, the CEO of the Dollywood Foundation.

The impact of the fund&#x27;s financial relief for the 2016 wildfire victims was studied by University of Tennessee College of Social Work professor Stacia West, who examined the impact of cash transfers in poverty alleviation. West surveyed 100 recipients of the emergency relief funds in April 2017 on topics including questions on housing, financial impact, physical and emotional health, and sources of support, with a follow-up survey conducted in December 2017. West found that the &quot;My People Fund&quot;, in tandem with traditional disaster response, gave families the ability to make decisions that were most beneficial to them, and concluded that unconditional cash support may be more beneficial for disaster relief than conditional financial support. The report cited the impact of the monthly financial disbursements from the &quot;My People Fund&quot; on residents&#x27; emergency savings: &quot;Following the monthly disbursements of unconditional cash assistance, participants were able to return to baseline financial stability reported prior to the wildfire, and improve their ability to set aside savings for hypothetical future emergencies.&quot;

Parton has been a generous donor to Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Among her gifts was a contribution to the Monroe Carell Jr. Children&#x27;s Hospital at Vanderbilt Pediatric Cancer Program in honor of a friend, Naji Abumrad, and her niece, Hannah Dennison, who was successfully treated for leukemia as a child at the Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In the aftermath of 2024&#x27;s Hurricane Helene, Parton announced a donation of $2 million to relief efforts, $1 million personally and another $1 million through her various businesses and the Dollywood Foundation.

===LGBTQ+ rights===
Though often politically neutral, Parton is known for her long history of openly supporting LGBTQ rights. LGBTQ+ magazines &quot;LGBTQ Nation&quot; and &quot;The Advocate&quot; have described her as an &quot;LGBTQ+ icon,&quot; and it was noted that she first publicly showed support for LGBTQ families in her 1991 song &quot;Family&quot;. She also publicly came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2009.

===Moderna COVID-19 vaccine===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Parton donated $1million towards research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and encouraged those who can afford it to make similar donations. She said &quot;I&#x27;m a very proud girl today to know I had anything at all to do with something that&#x27;s going to help us through this crazy pandemic.&quot; Her donation funded the critical early stages of development of the Moderna vaccine. In March 2021, Parton was vaccinated against COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University. She labeled social media accounts of the occasion &quot;Dolly gets a dose of her own medicine.&quot; Parton strongly encouraged everyone to get vaccinated when eligible and performed a song celebrating her vaccination, set to the tune of her song &quot;Jolene&quot;.

During the Trump presidency, Parton turned down the Presidential Medal of Freedom twice due to her husband&#x27;s illness and the ongoing pandemic. Parton turned down the Presidential Medal of Freedom a third time during the Biden presidency to avoid the appearance of politics. In response to a 2021 proposal by the Tennessee legislature to erect a statue of Parton, she released a statement asking the legislature to remove the bill from consideration, saying &quot;Given all that is going on in the world, I don&#x27;t think putting me on a pedestal is appropriate at this time.&quot;

In late 2022, Parton received a $100-million Courage and Civility Award from the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. According to Bezos, the award was given to Parton because of her charity work focused on improving children&#x27;s literacy around the world.

<text>Diprotodon (Ancient Greek: &quot;two protruding front teeth&quot;) is an extinct genus of marsupial from the Pleistocene of Australia containing one species, D. optatum. The earliest finds date to 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago but most specimens are dated to after 110,000 years ago. Its remains were first unearthed in 1830 in Wellington Caves, New South Wales, and contemporaneous paleontologists guessed they belonged to rhinos, elephants, hippos or dugongs. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was formally described by English naturalist Richard Owen in 1838, and was the first named Australian fossil mammal, and led Owen to become the foremost authority of his time on other marsupials and Australian megafauna, which were enigmatic to European science.

&quot;Diprotodon&quot; is the largest-known marsupial to have ever lived; it greatly exceeds the size of its closest living relatives wombats and koalas. It is a member of the extinct family Diprotodontidae, which includes other large quadrupedal herbivores. It grew to at the shoulders, over from head to tail, and likely weighed several tonnes, possibly as much as . Females were much smaller than males. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; supported itself on elephant-like legs to travel long distances, and inhabited most of Australia. The digits were weak; most of the weight was probably borne on the wrists and ankles. The hindpaws angled inward at 130°. Its jaws may have produced a strong bite force of at the long and ever-growing incisor teeth, and over at the last molar. Such powerful jaws would have allowed it to eat vegetation in bulk, crunching and grinding plant materials such as twigs, buds and leaves of woody plants with its bilophodont teeth.

It is the only marsupial and metatherian that is known to have made seasonal migrations. Large herds, usually of females, seem to have marched through a wide range of habitats to find food and water, walking at around . &quot;Diprotodon&quot; may have formed polygynous societies, possibly using its powerful incisors to fight for mates or fend off predators, such as the largest-known marsupial carnivore &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;. Being a marsupial, the mother may have raised her joey in a pouch on her belly, probably with one of these facing backwards, as in wombats.

&quot;Diprotodon&quot; went extinct about 40,000 years ago as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions, along with every other Australian animal over ; the extinction was possibly caused by extreme drought conditions and predation pressure from the first Aboriginal Australians, who likely co-existed with &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and other megafauna in Australia for several thousand years prior to its extinction. There is little direct evidence of interactions between Aboriginal Australians and &quot;Diprotodon&quot;—or most other Australian megafauna. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; has been conjectured by some authors to have been the origin of some aboriginal mythological figures—most notably the bunyip—and aboriginal rock artworks, but these ideas are unconfirmable.

==Research history==
In 1830, farmer George Ranken found a diverse fossil assemblage while exploring Wellington Caves, New South Wales, Australia. This was the first major site of extinct Australian megafauna. Remains of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; were excavated when Ranken later returned as part of a formal expedition that was headed by explorer Major Thomas Mitchell.

At the time these massive fossils were discovered, it was generally thought they were remains of rhinos, elephants, hippos, or dugongs. The fossils were not formally described until Mitchell took them in 1837 to his former colleague English naturalist Richard Owen while in England publishing his journal. In 1838, while studying a piece of a right mandible with an incisor, Owen compared the tooth to those of wombats and hippos; he wrote to Mitchell designating it as a new genus &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. Mitchell published the correspondence in his journal. Owen formally described &quot;Diprotodon&quot; in Volume 2 without mentioning a species; in Volume 1, however, he listed the name &quot;Diprotodon optatum&quot;, making that the type species. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; means &quot;two protruding front teeth&quot; in Ancient Greek and &quot;optatum&quot; is Latin for &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;wish&quot;. It was the first-ever Australian fossil mammal to be described. In 1844, Owen replaced the name &quot;D. optatum&quot; with &quot;&quot;D. australis&quot;. Owen only once used the name &quot;optatum&quot; and the acceptance of its apparent replacement &quot;australis&quot;&quot; has historically varied widely but &quot;optatum&quot; is now standard.

In 1843, Mitchell was sent more &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils from the recently settled Darling Downs and relayed them to Owen. With these, Owen surmised that &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was an elephant related to or synonymous with &quot;Mastodon&quot; or &quot;Deinotherium&quot;, pointing to the incisors which he interpreted as tusks, the flattening (anteroposterior compression) of the femur similar to the condition in elephants and rhinos, and the raised ridges of the molar characteristic of elephant teeth. Later that year, he formally synonymised &quot;Diprotodon&quot; with &quot;Deinotherium&quot; as &quot;Dinotherium Australe&quot;, which he recanted in 1844 after German naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt pointed out that the incisors clearly belong to a marsupial. Owen still classified the molars from Wellington as &quot;Mastodon australis&quot; and continued to describe &quot;Diprotodon&quot; as likely elephantine. In 1847, a nearly complete skull and skeleton was recovered from the Darling Downs, the latter confirming this elephantine characterisation. The massive skeleton attracted a large audience while on public display in Sydney. Leichhardt believed the animal was aquatic, and in 1844 he said it might still be alive in an undiscovered tropical area nearer the interior. But, as the European land exploration of Australia progressed, he became certain it was extinct. Owen later become the foremost authority of Australian palaeontology of his time, mostly working with marsupials.

Huge assemblages of mostly-complete &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils have been unearthed in dry lakes and riverbeds; the largest assemblage came from Lake Callabonna, South Australia. Fossils were first noticed here by an aboriginal stockman working on a sheep property to the east. The owners, the Ragless brothers, notified the South Australian Museum, which hired Australian geologist Henry Hurst, who reported an enormous wealth of fossil material and was paid £250 in 1893 to excavate the site. Hurst found up to 360 &quot;Diprotodon&quot; individuals over a few acres; excavation was restarted in the 1970s and more were uncovered. American palaeontologist Richard H. Tedford said multiple herds of these animals had at different times become stuck in mud while crossing bodies of water while water levels were low during dry seasons.

In addition to &quot;D. optatum&quot;, several other species were erected in the 19th century, often from single specimens, on the basis of subtle anatomical variations. Among the variations was size difference: adult &quot;Diprotodon&quot; specimens have two distinct size ranges. In their 1975 review of Australian fossil mammals, Australian palaeontologists J. A. Mahoney and William David Lindsay Ride did not ascribe this to sexual dimorphism because males and females of modern wombat and koala species—its closest living relatives—are skeletally indistinguishable, so they assumed the same would have been true for extinct relatives, including &quot;Diprotodon&quot;.
These other species are:
*&quot;D. annextans&quot; was erected in 1861 by Irish palaeontologist Frederick McCoy based on some teeth and a partial mandible found near Colac, Victoria; the name may be a typo of &quot;annectens&quot;, which means linking or joining, because he characterised the species as combining traits from &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and &quot;Nototherium&quot;;
*&quot;D. minor&quot; was erected in 1862 by Thomas Huxley based on a partial palate; in 1991, Australian palaeontologist Peter Murray suggested classifying large specimens as &quot;D. optatum&quot; and smaller ones as &quot;&quot;D. minor&quot;;
*&quot;D. longiceps&quot; was erected in 1865 by McCoy as a replacement for &quot;D. annextans&quot;&quot;;
*&quot;D. bennettii&quot; was erected in 1873 by German naturalist Gerard Krefft based on a nearly complete mandible collected by naturalists George Bennet and Georgina King near Gowrie, New South Wales; and
*&quot;D. loderi&quot; was erected in 1873 by Krefft based on a partial palate collected by Andrew Loder near Murrurundi, New South Wales.
In 2008, Australian palaeontologist Gilbert Price opted to recognise only one species &quot;D. optatum&quot; based most-notably on a lack of dental differences among these supposed species, and said it was likely &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was indeed sexually dimorphic, with the male probably being the larger form.

==Classification==
===Phylogeny===
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; is a marsupial in the order Diprotodontia, suborder Vombatiformes (wombats and koalas), and infraorder Vombatomorphia (wombats and allies). It is unclear how different groups of vombatiformes are related to each other because the most-completely known members—living or extinct—are exceptionally derived (highly specialised forms that are quite different from their last common ancestor).

In 1872, American mammalogist Theodore Gill erected the superfamily Diprotodontoidea and family Diprotodontidae to house &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. New species were later added to both groups; by the 1960s, the first diprotodontoids dating to before the Pliocene were discovered, better clarifying their relationship to each other. Because of this, in 1967, American palaeontologist Ruben A. Stirton subdivided Diprotodontoidea into one family, Diprotodontidae, with four subfamilies; Diprotodontinae (containing &quot;Diprotodon&quot; among others), Nototheriinae, Zygomaturinae, and Palorchestinae. In 1977, Australian palaeontologist Michael Archer synonymised Nototheriinae with Diprotodontinae and in 1978, Archer and Australian palaeontologist Alan Bartholomai elevated Palorchestinae to family level as Palorchestidae, leaving Diprotodontoidea with families Diprotodontidae and Palorchestidae; and Diprotodontidae with subfamilies Diprotodontinae and Zygomaturinae.

Below is the Diprotodontoidea family tree according to Australian palaeontologists Karen H. Black and Brian Mackness, 1999 (top), and Vombatiformes family tree according to Beck &quot;et al.&quot; 2020 (bottom):



===Evolution===
Diprotodontidae is the most diverse family in Vombatomorphia; it was better adapted to the spreading dry, open landscapes over the last tens of millions of years than other groups in the infraorder, living or extinct. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; has been found in every Australian state, making it the most-widespread Australian megafauna in the fossil record. The oldest vombatomorph (and vombatiform) is &quot;Mukupirna&quot;, which was identified in 2020 from Oligocene deposits of the South Australian Namba Formation dating to 26–25 million years ago. The group probably evolved much earlier; &quot;Mukupirna&quot; was already differentiated as a closer relative to wombats than other vombatiformes, and attained a massive size of roughly , whereas the last common ancestor of vombatiformes was probably a small, creature.

Both diprotodontines and zygomaturines were both apparently quite diverse over the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene, roughly 23 million years ago, though the familial and subfamilial classifications of diprotodontoids from this period is debated. Compared to zygomaturines, diprotodontines were rare during the Miocene, the only identified genus being &quot;Pyramios&quot;. By the Late Miocene, diprotodontians became the commonest marsupial order in fossil sites, a dominance that endures to the present day; at this point, the most-prolific diprotodontians were diprotodontids and kangaroos. Diprotodontidae also began a gigantism trend, along with several other marsupials, probably in response to the lower-quality plant foods available in a drying climate, requiring them to consume much more. Gigantism appears to have evolved independently six times among the vombatiform lineages. Diprotodontine diversity returned in the Pliocene; Diprotodontidae reached peak diversity with seven genera, coinciding with the spread of open forests. In 1977, Archer said &quot;Diprotodon&quot; directly evolved from the smaller &quot;Euryzygoma&quot;, which has been discovered in Pliocene deposits of eastern Australia predating 2.5 million years ago.

In general, there is poor resolution on the ages of Australian fossil sites. While the geochronology of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is one of best for Australian megafauna, it is still incomplete and the majority of remains are undated. Price and Australian palaeontologist Katarzyna Piper reported the earliest, indirectly dated &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils from the Nelson Bay Formation at Nelson Bay, New South Wales, which dates to 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago during the Early Pleistocene. These remains are 8–17% smaller than those of Late Pleistocene &quot;Diprotodon&quot; but are otherwise indistinguishable. The oldest directly dated &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils come from the Boney Bite site at Floraville, New South Wales; they were deposited approximately 340,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene based on U-series dating and luminescence dating of quartz and orthoclase. Floraville is the only-identified Middle Pleistocene site in tropical northern Australia. Beyond these, almost all dated &quot;Diprotodon&quot; material comes from Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5) or younger—after 110,000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene.

==Description==

===Skull===
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; has a long, narrow skull. Like other marsupials, the top of the skull of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is flat or depressed over the small braincase and the sinuses of the frontal bone. Like many other giant vombatiformes, the frontal sinuses are extensive; in a specimen from Bacchus Marsh, they take up —roughly 25% of skull volume—whereas the brain occupies —only 4% of the skull volume. Marsupials tend to have smaller brain-to-body mass ratios than placental mammals, becoming more disparate the bigger the animal, which could be a response to a need to conserve energy because the brain is a calorically expensive organ, or is proportional to the maternal metabolic rate, which is much less in marsupials due to the shorter gestation period. The expanded sinuses increase the surface area available for the temporalis muscle to attach, which is important for biting and chewing, to compensate for a deflated braincase as a result of a proportionally smaller brain. They may also have helped dissipate stresses produced by biting more efficiently across the skull.

The occipital bone, the back of the skull, slopes forward at 45 degrees unlike most modern marsupials, where it is vertical. The base of the occipital is significantly thickened. The occipital condyles, a pair of bones that connect the skull with the vertebral column, are semi-circular and the bottom half is narrower than the top. The inner border, which forms the foramen magnum where the spinal cord feeds through, is thin and well-defined. The top margin of the foramen magnum is somewhat flattened rather than arched. The foramen expands backwards towards the inlet, especially vertically, and is more-reminiscent of a short neural canal—the tube running through a vertebral centrum where the spinal cord passes through—than a foramen magnum.

A sagittal crest extends across the midline of the skull from the supraoccipital—the top of the occipital bone—to the region between the eyes on the top of the head. The orbit (eye socket) is small and vertically oval-shaped. The nasal bones slightly curve upwards until near their endpoint, where they begin to curve down, giving the bones a somewhat S-shaped profile. Like many marsupials, most of the nasal septum is made of bone rather than cartilage. The nose would have been quite mobile. The height of the skull from the peak of the occipital bone to the end of the nasals is strikingly almost uniform; the end of the nasals is the tallest point. The zygomatic arch (cheek bone) is strong and deep as in kangaroos but unlike those of koalas and wombats, and extends all the way from the supraoccipital.

====Jaws====
As in kangaroos and wombats, there is a gap between the jointing of the palate (roof of the mouth) and the maxilla (upper jaw) behind the last molar, which is filled by the medial pterygoid plate. This would have been the insertion for the medial pterygoid muscle that was involved in closing the jaw. Like many grazers, the masseter muscle, which is also responsible for closing the jaw, seems to have been the dominant jaw muscle. A probable large temporal muscle compared to the lateral pterygoid muscle may indicate, unlike in wombats, a limited range of side-to-side jaw motion means &quot;Diprotodon&quot; would have been better at crushing rather than grinding food. The insertion of the masseter is placed forwards, in front of the orbits, which could have allowed better control over the incisors. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; chewing strategy appears to align more with kangaroos than wombats: a powerful vertical crunch was followed by a transverse grinding motion.

As in other marsupials, the ramus of the mandible, the portion that goes up to connect with the skull, angles inward. The condyloid process, which connects the jaw to the skull, is similar to that of a koala. The ramus is straight and extends almost vertically, thickening as it approaches the body of the mandible where the teeth are. The depth of the body of the mandible increases from the last molar to the first. The strong mandibular symphysis, which fuses the two halves of the mandible, begins at the front-most end of the third molar; this would prevent either half of the mandible from moving independently of the other, unlike in kangaroos which use this ability to better control their incisors.

====Teeth====
The dental formula of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is . In each half of either jaw are three incisors in the upper jaw and one in the lower jaw; there are one premolar and four molars in both jaws but no canines. A long diastema (gap) separates the incisors from the molars.

The incisors are scalpriform (chisel-like). Like those of wombats and rodents, the first incisors in both jaws continuously grew throughout the animal&#x27;s life but the other two upper incisors did not. This combination is not seen in any living marsupial. The cross-section of the upper incisors is circular. In one old male specimen, the first upper incisor measures of which is within the tooth socket; the second is and is in the socket; and the exposed part of the third is . The first incisor is convex and curves outwards but the other two are concave. The lower incisor has a faint upward curve but is otherwise straight and has an oval cross-section. In the same old male specimen, the lower incisor measures , of which is inside the socket.

The premolars and molars are bilophodont, each having two distinct lophs (ridges). The premolar is triangular and about half the size of the molars. As in kangaroos, the necks of the lophs are coated in cementum. Unlike in kangaroos, there is no connecting ridge between the lophs. The peaks of these lophs have a thick enamel coating that thins towards the base; this could wear away with use and expose the dentine layer, and beneath that osteodentine. Like the first premolar of other marsupials, the first molar of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and wombats is the only tooth that is replaced. &quot;D. optatum&quot; premolars were highly morphologically variable even within the same individual.

===Vertebrae===
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; had seven cervical (neck) vertebrae. The atlas, the first cervical (C1), has a pair of deep cavities for insertion of the occipital condyles. The diaphophyses of the atlas, an upward-angled projection on either the side of the vertebra, are relatively short and thick, and resemble those of wombats and koalas. The articular surface of the axis (C2), the part that joints to another vertebra, is slightly concave on the front side and flat on the back side. As in kangaroos, the axis has a low subtriangular hypophysis projecting vertically from the underside of the vertebra and a proportionally long odontoid—a projection from the axis which fits into the atlas—but the neural spine, which projects vertically the topside of the vertebra, is more forwards. The remaining cervicals lack a hypophysis. As in kangaroos, C3 and C4 have a shorter and more-compressed neural spine, which is supported by a low ridge along its midline in the front and the back. The neural spine of C5 is narrower but thicker, and is supported by stronger-but-shorter ridges. C7 had a forked shape on top of the neural spine.

&quot;Diprotodon&quot; probably had 13 dorsal vertebrae and 14 pairs of closely spaced ribs. Like many other mammals, the dorsals initially decrease in breadth and then expand before connecting to the lumbar vertebrae. Unusually, the front dorsals match the short proportions of the cervicals, and the articular surface is flat. At the beginning of the series, the neural spine is broad and angled forward, and is also supported by a low ridge along its midline in the front and the back. In later examples, the neural spine is angled backwards and bifurcates (splits into two). Among mammals, bifurcation of the neural spine is only seen in elephants and humans, and only in a few of the cervicals and not in the dorsals. Compared to those of wombats and kangaroos, the neural arch is proportionally taller. As in elephants, the epiphysial plates (growth plates) and the neural arch, to which the neural spine is attached, are anchylosed—very rigid in regard to the vertebral centrum—which served to support the animal&#x27;s immense weight.

Like most marsupials, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; likely had six lumbar vertebrae. They retain a proportionally tall neural arch but not the diapophyses, though L1 can retain a small protuberance on one side where a diapophysis would be in a dorsal vertebra; this has been documented in kangaroos and other mammals. The length of each vertebra increases along the series so the lumbar series may have bent downward.

Like other marsupials, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; had two sacral vertebrae. The base of the neural spines of these two were ossified (fused) together.

===Limbs===
====Girdles====
The general proportions of the scapula (shoulder blade) align more closely with more-basal vertebrates such as monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish rather than marsupials and placental mammals. It is triangular and proportionally narrow but unlike most mammals with a triangular scapula, the arm attaches to top of the scapula and the subspinous fossa (the fossa, a depression below the spine of the scapula) becomes bigger towards the arm joint rather than decreasing. The glenoid cavity where the arm connects is oval shaped as in most mammals.

Unlike other marsupials, the ilia, the large wings of the pelvis, are lamelliform (short and broad, with a flat surface instead of an iliac fossa). Lamelliform ilia have only been recorded in elephants, sloths, and apes, though these groups all have a much-longer sacral vertebra series whereas marsupials are restricted to two sacral vertebrae. The ilia provided strong muscle attachments that were probably oriented and used much the same as those in an elephant. The sacroiliac joint where the pelvis connects to the spine is at 35 degrees in reference to the long axis of the ilium. The ischia, which form part of the hip socket, are thick and rounded tailwards but taper and diverge towards the socket, unlike those in kangaroos, where the ischia proceed almost parallel to each other. They were not connected to the vertebra. The hip socket itself is well-rounded and almost hemispherical.

====Long bones====
Unlike those of most marsupials, the humerus of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is almost straight rather than S-shaped, and the trochlea of the humerus at the elbow joint is not perforated. The ridges for muscle attachments are poorly developed, which seems to have been compensated for by the powerful forearms. Similarly, the condyles where the radius and ulna (the forearm bones) connect maintain their rounded shape and are quite-similarly sized, and unusually reminiscent of the condyles between the femur and the tibia and fibula in the leg of a kangaroo.
Like elephants, the femur of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is straight and compressed anteroposteriorly (from headside to tailside). The walls of the femur are prodigiously thickened, strongly constricting the medullary cavity where the bone marrow is located. The proximal end (part closest to the hip joint) is notably long, broad, and deep. The femoral head projects up far from the greater trochanter. As in kangaroos, the greater trochanter is split into two lobes. The femoral neck is roughly the same diameter as the femoral head. Also as in kangaroos, the condyle for the fibula is excavated out but the condyle for the tibia is well-rounded and hemispherical. Like those of many other marsupials, the tibia is twisted and the tibial malleolus (on the ankle) is reduced.

====Paws====
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; has five digits on either paw. Like other plantigrade walkers, where the paws were flat on the ground, the wrist and ankle would have been largely rigid and inflexible. The digits are proportionally weak so the paws probably had a lot of padding. Similarly, the digits do not seem to have been much engaged in weight bearing.

The forepaw was strong and the shape of the wrist bones is quite similar to those of kangaroos. Like other vombatiformes, the metacarpals, which connect the fingers to the wrist, are broadly similar to those of kangaroos and allies. The enlarged pisiform bone takes up half the jointing surface of the ulna. The fifth digit on the forepaw is the largest.

The digits of the hindpaws turn inwards from the ankle at 130 degrees. The second and third metatarsals (the metatarsals connect the toes to the ankle) are significantly reduced, which may mean these digits were syndactylous (fused) like those of all modern diprotodontians. The first, fourth, and fifth digits are enlarged. The toes are each about the same length, except the fifth which is much stouter.

===Size===
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; is the largest-known marsupial to ever have lived. In life, adult &quot;Diprotodon&quot; could have reached at the shoulders and from head to tail. Accounting for cartilaginous intervertebral discs, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; may have been 20% longer than reconstructed skeletons, exceeding .

As researchers were formulating predictive body-mass equations for fossil species, efforts were largely constrained to eutherian mammals rather than marsupials. The first person to attempt to estimate the living weight of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was Peter Murray in his 1991 review of the megafauna of Pleistocene Australia; Murray made an estimate of using cranial and dental measurements, which he said was probably not a very precise figure. This made &quot;Diprotodon&quot; the largest herbivore in Australia. In 2001, Canadian biologist Gary Burness and colleagues did a linear regression between the largest herbivores and carnivores—living or extinct—from every continent (for Australia: &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, &quot;Varanus priscus&quot;, and &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;) against the landmass area of their continent, and another regression between the daily food intake of living creatures against the landmass of their continents. He calculated the food requirement of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was 50–60% smaller than expected for Australia&#x27;s landmass, which he believed was a result of a generally lower metabolism in marsupials compared to placentals—up to 20% lower—and sparser nutritious vegetation than other continents. The maximum-attainable body size is capped much lower than those for other continents.

In 2003, Australian palaeontologist Stephen Wroe and colleagues took a more-sophisticated approach to body mass than Murray&#x27;s estimate. They made a regression between the minimum circumference of the femora and humeri of 18 quadrupedal marsupials and 32 placentals against body mass, and then inputted 17 &quot;Diprotodon&quot; long bones into their predictive model. The results ranged from , for a mean of , though Wroe said reconstructing the weight of extinct creatures that far outweighed living counterparts is problematic. For comparison, an American bison they used in their study weighed and a hippo weighed .

==Paleobiology==

===Diet===
Like modern megaherbivores, most evidently the African elephant, Pleistocene Australian megafauna likely had a profound effect on the vegetation, limiting the spread of forest cover and woody plants. Carbon isotope analysis suggests &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fed on a broad range of foods and, like kangaroos, was consuming both C3—well-watered trees, shrubs, and grasses—and C4 plants—arid grasses, a finding replicated by calcium isotope analysis showing &quot;Diprotodon&quot; to have been a mixed feeder. Carbon isotope analyses on &quot;Diprotodon&quot; excavated from the Cuddie Springs site in units SU6 (possibly 45,000 years old) and SU9 (350,000 to 570,000 years old) indicate &quot;Diprotodon&quot; adopted a somewhat-more-varied seasonal diet as Australia&#x27;s climate dried but any change was subtle. In contrast, contemporary kangaroos and wombats underwent major dietary shifts or specialisations towards, respectively, C3 and C4 plants. The fossilised, incompletely digested gut contents of one 53,000-year-old individual from Lake Callabonna show its last meal consisted of young leaves, stalks, and twigs.

The molars of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; are a simple bilophodont shape. Kangaroos use their bilophodont teeth to grind tender, low-fibre plants as a browser as well as grass as a grazer. Kangaroos that predominantly graze have specialised molars to resist the abrasiveness of grass but such adaptations are not exhibited in &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, which may have had a mixed diet similar to that of a browsing wallaby. It may also have chewed like wallabies, beginning with a vertical crunch before grinding transversely, as opposed to wombats, which only grind transversely. Similarly to many large ungulates (hoofed mammals), the jaws of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; were better suited for crushing rather than grinding, which would have permitted it to process vegetation in bulk.

In 2016, Australian biologists Alana Sharpe and Thomas Rich estimated the maximum-possible bite force of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; using finite element analysis. They calculated at the incisors and across the molar series. For reference, the American alligator can produce forces upwards of . Though these are likely overestimates, the jaws of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; were exceptionally strong, which would have allowed it to consume a broad range of plants, including tough, fibrous grasses.

===Migration and sociality===
In 2017, by measuring the strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) at various points along the &quot;Diprotodon&quot; incisor QMF3452 from the Darling Downs, and matching those ratios to the ratios of sites across that region, Price and colleagues determined &quot;Diprotodon&quot; made seasonal migrations, probably in search of food or watering holes. This individual appears to have been following the Condamine River and, while apparently keeping to the Darling Downs during the three years this tooth had been growing, it would have been annually making a northwest-southeast round trip. This trek parallels the mammalian mass migrations of modern-day East Africa.

&quot;Diprotodon&quot; is the only identified metatherian that seasonally migrated between two places. A few modern marsupials, such as the red kangaroo, have been documented making migrations when necessary but it is not a seasonal occurrence. Because &quot;Diprotodon&quot; could do it, it is likely other Pleistocene Australian megafauna also had seasonal migrations.

&quot;Diprotodon&quot; apparently moved in large herds. Possible fossilised herds, which are most-commonly unearthed in south-eastern Australia, seem to be mostly or entirely female, and sometimes travelled with juveniles. Such sexual segregation is normally seen in polygynous species; it is a common social organisation among modern megaherbivores involving an entirely female herd save for their young and the dominant male, with which the herd exclusinvely breeds. Similarly, the skull is adapted to handling much-higher stresses than that which resulted from bite alone so &quot;Diprotodon&quot; may have subjected its teeth or jaws to more-strenuous activities than chewing, such as fighting other &quot;Diprotodon&quot; for mates or fending off predators, using the incisors. Like modern red and grey kangaroos, which also sexually segregate, bachelor herds of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; seem to have been less tolerant to drought conditions than female herds due to their larger size and nutritional requirements.

===Gait===
The locomotion of an extinct animal can be inferred using fossil trackways, which seldom preserve in Australia over the Cenozoic. Only the trackways of humans, kangaroos, vombatids, &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, and the diprotodontid &quot;Euowenia&quot; have been identified. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; trackways have been found at Lake Callabonna and the Victorian Volcanic Plain grasslands. The diprotodontid manus (forepaw) print is semi-circular and the pes (hindpaw) is reniform (kidney-shaped). Owing to proportionally small digits, most of the weight was borne on the carpus and tarsus—the bones connecting to respectively the wrist and the ankle. Diprotodontines seem to have had a much-more-erect gait, an adaptation to long-distance travel that is similar to that of elephants, rather than the more-sprawling posture of wombats and zygomaturines, though there are no fossil trackways of the latter to verify their reconstructed standing posture.

At Lake Callabonna, the single &quot;Diprotodon&quot; responsible for the impressions had an average stride length of , trackway width of , and track dimensions in length x width. The gleno-acetabular length—the distance between the shoulders and pelvis—could have been about ; assuming a hip height of , the maker of these tracks was probably moving at around .

The single &quot;Diprotodon&quot; responsible for the impressions at the volcanic plain had an average stride length of , trackway width of , and pes length of . The gleno-acetabular length may have been about and assuming a hip height of , the maker of the tracks was probably moving at around . Its posture was much-more-sprawled than the example from Callabonna, aligning more with what might be expected of &quot;Zygomaturus&quot;. The animal may have been a female carrying a large joey in her pouch, the added weight on the stomach altering the gait. The first trackway continues for in a south-easterly direction towards a palaeo-lake. The animal seems to have hesitated while stepping down from the first sand bar on its path with the right pes making three overlapping prints here while shuffling around. The trackway vanishes for a stretch and reappears while the animal seemingly is stepping on wet sediment. Another diprotodontid trackway appears away, moving southerly, which may have been left by the same individual.

===Life history===
The marsupial metabolic rate is about 30% lower than that of placentals due to a lower body temperature of . Marsupials give birth at an earlier point in foetal development, relying on lactation to facilitate most of the joey&#x27;s development; because pregnancy is much-more-energetically expensive, investing in lactation rather than longer gestation can be advantageous in a highly seasonal and unpredictable climate to minimise maternal nutritional requirements. Consequently, marsupials cannot support as large a litter size or as short a generation time.

Based on the relationship between female body size and life history in kangaroos, a &quot;Diprotodon&quot; female would have gestated for six-to-eight weeks, and given birth to a single joey. Given its massive size, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; may not have sat down to give birth as do smaller marsupials, possibly standing instead. Like koalas and wombats, the pouch may have faced backwards so the joey could crawl down across its mother&#x27;s abdomen to enter and attach itself to a teat until it could see—perhaps 260 days—and thermoregulate. It would have permanently left the pouch after 860 days and suckled until reaching after four or five years.

In large kangaroos, females usually reach sexual maturity and enter oestrus soon after weaning, and males need double the time to reach sexual maturity. A similar pattern could have been exhibited in &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. Assuming a lifespan of up to 50 years, a female &quot;Diprotodon&quot; could have given birth eight times.

==Palaeoecology==
&quot;Diprotodon&quot; was present across the entire Australian continent by the Late Pleistocene, especially following MIS5 approximately 110,000 years ago. The onset of the Quaternary glaciation, with the continuous advance and retreat of glaciers at the poles, created extreme climatic variability elsewhere. In Australia, the warmer, wetter interglacial periods were received by forests and woodlands; colder, dryer glacial periods were more conducive to grasslands and deserts. The continent progressively became dryer as the Asian monsoons became less influential over Australia: the vast interior had become arid and sandy by 500,000 years ago; the mega-lakes that were once prominent, especially during interglacials in north-western Australia, dried up; and the rainforests of eastern Australia gradually retreated. Aridity has hastened over the last 100,000 years, especially after 60,000 years ago with surging El Niño–Southern Oscillations.

The continent-wide distribution of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; indicates herds trekked across almost any habitat, much like modern African elephants south of the Sahara. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; was a member of a diverse assemblage of megafauna that were endemic to Pleistocene Australia; these also included the thylacine, modern kangaroos, sthenurines (giant short-faced kangaroos), a diversity of modern and giant koala and wombat species, the tapir-like &quot;Palorchestes&quot;, the giant turtle &quot;Meiolania&quot;, and the giant bird &quot;Genyornis&quot;. &quot;Diprotodon&quot; coexisted with the diprotodontid &quot;Zygomaturus trilobus&quot;, which appears to have remained in the forests, whereas &quot;Diprotodon&quot; foraged the expanding grasslands and woodlands. Other contemporaneous dipotodontids (&quot;Hulitherium&quot;, &quot;Z. nimborensia&quot;, and &quot;Maokopia&quot;) were insular forms that were restricted to the forests of New Guinea.

===Predation===
Due to its massive size, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; would have been a tough adversary for native carnivores. It contended with the largest-known marsupial predator &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;; while &quot;Diprotodon&quot; remains that were gnawed or bitten by &quot;T. carnifex&quot; have been identified, it is unclear if the marsupial predator was powerful enough to kill an animal surpassing . The modern jaguar, at half the size of &quot;T. carnifex&quot;, can kill a bull so it is possible &quot;T. carnifex&quot; could have killed small &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. Similar to recent kangaroos with thylacines or quolls, juvenile &quot;Diprotodon&quot; may have been at high risk of predation by &quot;T. carnifex&quot;; it and fossils of juvenile &quot;Diprotodon&quot; have been recovered from the same caves.

The largest predators of Australia were reptiles, most notably the saltwater crocodile, the now-extinct crocodiles &quot;Paludirex&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot;, and the giant lizard megalania (&quot;Varanus priscus&quot;). At in length, megalania was the largest carnivore of Pleistocene Australia.

===Extinction===

As part of the Quaternary extinction event, &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and every other Australian land animal heavier than became extinct. The timing and the exact cause are unclear because there is poor resolution on the ages of Australian fossil sites. Since their discovery, the extinction of the Australian megafauna has usually been blamed on the changing climate or overhunting by the first Aboriginal Australians. In 2001, Australian palaeontologist Richard Roberts and colleagues dated 28 major fossil sites across the continent, and were able to provide a precise date for megafaunal extinction. They found most disappear from the fossil record by 80,000 years ago, but &quot;Diprotodon&quot;; the giant wombat &quot;Phascolonus&quot;; &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;; and the short-faced kangaroos &quot;Procoptodon&quot;, &quot;Protemnodon&quot;, and &quot;Simosthenurus&quot; were identified at Ned&#x27;s Gully, Queensland, and Kudjal Yolgah Cave, Western Australia, which they dated to respectively 47,000 and 46,000 years ago. Thus, all of the Australian Pleistocene megafauna died out probably between about 50,000 and 41,000 years ago. There also seems to have been a diverse assemblage of megafauna just before their extinction, and all populations across at least western and eastern Australia died out at about the same time. As of 2021, there is still no solid evidence of megafauna surviving past approximately 40,000 years ago; their latest occurrence, including &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, is recorded at South Walker Creek mine in the north-east at about 40,100 ± 1,700 years ago.

At the time Roberts &quot;et al.&quot; published their paper, the earliest evidence of human activity in Australia was 56±4 thousand years old, which is close to their calculated date for the megafauna extinction; they hypothesised human hunting had eradicated the last megafauna within about 10,000 years of coexistence. Human hunting had earlier been blamed for the extinction of North American and New Zealand megafauna. Human activity was then generally regarded as the main driver of Australian megafaunal extinction, especially because the megafauna had survived multiple extreme drought periods during glacial periods. At the time, there did not seem to be any evidence of unusually extreme climate during this period. Due to the slowness of marsupial reproduction, even limited megafaunal hunting may have severely weakened the population.

In 2005, American geologist Gifford Miller noticed fire abruptly becomes more common about 45,000 years ago; he ascribed this increase to aboriginal fire-stick farmers, who would have regularly started controlled burns to clear highly productive forests and grasslands. Miller said this radically altered the vegetational landscape and promulgated the expanse of the modern-day fire-resilient scrub at the expense of the megafauna. Subsequent studies had difficulty firmly linking controlled burns with major ecological collapse. The frequency of fire could have also increased as a consequence of megafaunal extinction because total plant consumption rapidly fell, leading to faster fuel buildup.

In 2017, the human-occupied Madjedbebe rock shelter on the northern Australian coast was dated to about 65,000 years ago, which if correct would mean humans and megafauna had coexisted for over 20,000 years. Other authors have considered this dating questionable. In the 2010s, several ecological studies were published in support of major drought conditions coinciding with the final megafaunal extinctions. Their demise may have been the result of a combination of climatic change, human hunting, and human-driven landscape changes.

==Cultural significance==
===Fossil evidence===
Despite the role the first Aboriginal Australians are speculated to have had in the extinction of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and other mammalian megafauna in Australia, there is little evidence humans used them at all in the 20,000 years of coexistence. No fossils of mammalian megafauna suggestive of human butchery or cooking have been found.

In 1984, Gail Paton discovered an upper-right &quot;Diprotodon&quot; incisor (2I) bearing 28 visible cut marks in Spring Creek, south-western Victoria; Ron Vanderwald and Richard Fullager studied the incisor, which was split in half longitudinally, seemingly while the bone was still fresh but it was glued together before Vanderwald and Fullager could inspect it. Each piece measures in length. The marks are aligned in a straight line, and measure in length, in width, and in depth. They determined it was inconsistent with bite marks from scavenging &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; or mice, and concluded it was incised by humans with flint as a counting system or a random doodle. This specimen became one of the most-cited pieces of evidence humans and megafauna directly interacted until a 2020 re-analysis by Australian palaeoanthropologist Michelle Langley identified the engraver as most-likely a tiger quoll.

In 2016, Australian archaeologist Giles Hamm and colleagues unearthed a partial right radius belonging to a young &quot;Diprotodon&quot; in the Warratyi rock shelter. Because it lacks carnivore damage and the rock shelter is up a sheer face &quot;Diprotodon&quot; is unlikely to have climbed, they said humans were responsible for taking the &quot;Diprotodon&quot; to the site.

===Mythology===
When the first massive fossils in Australia were dug up, it was not clear what animals they might have represented because there were no serious scientists on the continent. Local residents guessed some may have been the remains of rhinos or elephants. European settlers, the most-vocal of whom was Reverend John Dunmore Lang, forwarded these fossils as evidence of the Genesis flood narrative. Aboriginal Australians also attempted to fit the finds into their own religious ideas, quickly associating &quot;Diprotodon&quot; with the bunyip, a large, carnivorous, lake monster. Many ethnologists and palaeontologists of the time believed the bunyip to be a tribal memory of the lumbering giant creature that probably frequented marshlands, though at the time it was uncertain whether &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and other megafauna were still extant because the Australian continent had not yet been fully explored by Europeans. Scientific investigation into the bunyip was stigmatised after a purported bunyip skull was sensationalised in 1846, and was put on display at the Australian Museum. The following year, however, Owen recognised it as the skull of a foal, and was surprised the burgeoning Australian scientific community could have erred so egregiously.

In 1892, Canadian geologist Henry Yorke Lyell Brown reported Aboriginal Australians identified &quot;Diprotodon&quot; fossils from Lake Eyre as those of the Rainbow Serpent, which he thought was a giant, bottom-dwelling fish. This notion became somewhat popularised after English geologist John Walter Gregory, who believed the god was a horned, scaly creature, conjectured it was a chimaera of &quot;Diprotodon&quot;—which he believed had a horn—and a crocodile. Later workers continued to report some link between the Rainbow Serpent and either &quot;Diprotodon&quot; or crocodiles.

These kinds of suppositions are not testable and require stories to survive in oral tradition for tens of thousands of years. If Pleistocene megafauna are the basis of some aboriginal mythology, it is unclear if the stories were based on the creatures when they were alive or their fossils being discovered long after their extinction.

===Rock art representations===
Aboriginal Australians decorated caves with paintings and drawings of several creatures but the identities of the subjects are often unclear. In 1907, Australian anthropologist Herbert Basedow found footprint petroglyphs in Yunta Springs and Wilkindinna, South Australia, which he believed were those of &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. In 1988, Australian historian Percy Trezise presented what he thought was a Quinkan depiction of &quot;Diprotodon&quot; to the First Congress of the Australian Rock Art Research Association. Both of these claims have their faults because the depictions bear several features that are inconsistent with what is known about &quot;Diprotodon&quot;. Unlike the more-naturalistic artwork of Early European modern humans, which are more easily identifiable as various animals, aboriginal artwork is much more stylistic and is mostly uninterpretable by an outsider. The subjects of aboriginal paintings can be mythological beings from the Dreaming rather than a corporeal subject.

<text>Dirk Benedict (born Dirk Niewoehner; March 1, 1945) is an American film, television and stage actor, and author. He is best known for playing the characters Lieutenant Starbuck in the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; film and television series and Templeton &quot;Face&quot; Peck in &quot;The A-Team&quot; television series. He is the author of &quot;Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy&quot; and &quot;And Then We Went Fishing&quot;.

==Early life==
Benedict was born Dirk Niewoehner in Helena, Montana, the son of George Edward Niewoehner, a lawyer, and his wife Priscilla Mella (née Metzger), an accountant. He grew up in White Sulphur Springs, Montana. He graduated from Whitman College in 1967.
Benedict allegedly chose his stage name from a serving of Eggs Benedict he had prior to his acting career. He is of German extraction.

==Career==
Benedict&#x27;s film debut was in the 1972 film &quot;Georgia, Georgia&quot;. When the New York run for &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in Hawaii, opposite Barbara Rush. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. The producers of a horror film called &quot;Sssssss&quot; (1973) saw Benedict&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of Twiggy in her American film debut, &quot;W&quot; (1974). Benedict starred in the television series &quot;Chopper One&quot;, which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. He also appeared on the &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; variety show.

Benedict&#x27;s career break came in 1978 when he appeared as Lieutenant Starbuck in the movie and television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The same year, Benedict starred in the TV film, &quot;Cruise into Terror&quot;, and appeared in the ensemble movie, &quot;Scavenger Hunt&quot; the following year.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Benedict starred alongside Linda Blair in an action-comedy movie called &quot;Ruckus&quot;. In 1983, Dirk gained further popularity as con man Templeton &quot;Faceman&quot; Peck in 1980s action television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;. He played &quot;Face&quot; from to , although the series didn&#x27;t air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn&#x27;t shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The second season episode &quot;Steel&quot; includes a scene at Universal Studios where Face is seen looking bemused as a Cylon walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The clip is incorporated into the series&#x27; opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.

In 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie &quot;Body Slam&quot; along with Lou Albano, Roddy Piper, and cameo appearances by Freddie Blassie, Ric Flair, and Bruno Sammartino. His character Smilac ends up managing the pro-wrestler &quot;Quick Rick&quot; Roberts (Piper) and faces opposition by Captain Lou Murano (Albano) and his wrestling tag-team &quot;the Cannibals&quot;.

In 1987, Benedict took the title role of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Abbey Theatre in Manhattan. Both his performance and the entire production were lambasted by critics. Benedict starred in the 1989 TV film &quot;Trenchcoat in Paradise&quot;.

In 1991, Benedict starred in &quot;Blue Tornado,&quot; playing Alex, call sign Fireball, an Italian Air Force fighter pilot. Benedict published an autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy: A True Story of Discovery, Acting, Health, Illness, Recovery, and Life&quot; (Avery Publishing ). In 1993, Benedict starred in &quot;Shadow Force&quot;.

Benedict also appeared as Jake Barnes in the 1996 action-adventure film &quot;Alaska&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
In 2000, Benedict wrote and directed his first screenplay, &quot;Cahoots&quot;. Benedict appeared in the 2006 German film &quot;Goldene Zeiten&quot; (&quot;Golden Times&quot;) in a dual role, playing an American former TV star as well as a German lookalike who impersonates him.

In 2006, he wrote an online essay criticizing the then-airing &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; re-imagined series and, especially, its casting of a woman as his character, Starbuck, writing that &quot;the war against masculinity has been won&quot; and that &quot;a television show based on hope, spiritual faith, and family is unimagined and regurgitated as a show of despair, sexual violence and family dysfunction&quot;.

He appeared as a contestant on the 2007 UK series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot;, in which he placed third. He arrived on launch night in a replica of the &quot;A-Team&quot; van, smoking a cigar and accompanied by the &quot;A-Team&quot; theme tune.

In 2010, Benedict starred in a stage production of &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot; playing Lieutenant Columbo for the Middle Ground Theatre Company in the UK. Benedict also made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film adaptation of &quot;The A-Team&quot; as Pensacola Prisoner Milt.

In 2019, Benedict took on the role of Jack Strange in the B movie &quot;Space Ninjas&quot;, written and directed by Scott McQuaid. Dirk plays an eccentric TV host of a show called &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, which is like a hybrid of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The movie is a sci-fi comedy horror that follows a bunch of high school students trying to survive the night of a Space Ninja invasion.

==Personal life==
===Cancer===
In the 1970s, Benedict survived a prostate tumor, which he refused to have tested for malignancy. Having rejected conventional medical treatment, he credited his survival to the adoption of a macrobiotic diet recommended to him by actress Gloria Swanson.

===Marriage and family===
In 1986, he married Toni Hudson, an actress with whom he has two sons, George and Roland. Hudson had previously appeared as Dana in the fourth season &quot;A-Team&quot; episode titled &quot;Blood, Sweat and Cheers&quot;. They divorced in 1995.

In 1998, Benedict learned that he also has another son from an earlier relationship, who was placed for adoption.

<doc id="8724" wikidata="Q76436" url="?curid=8724" title="Doppler effect">
<text>The Doppler effect (also Doppler shift) is the change in the frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the source of the wave. The &quot;Doppler effect&quot; is named after the physicist Christian Doppler, who described the phenomenon in 1842. A common example of Doppler shift is the change of pitch heard when a vehicle sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.

When the source of the sound wave is moving towards the observer, each successive cycle of the wave is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous cycle. Hence, from the observer&#x27;s perspective, the time between cycles is reduced, meaning the frequency is increased. Conversely, if the source of the sound wave is moving away from the observer, each cycle of the wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous cycle, so the arrival time between successive cycles is increased, thus reducing the frequency.

For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted. The total Doppler effect in such cases may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, motion of the medium, or any combination thereof. For waves propagating in vacuum, as is possible for electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves, only the difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.

==History==

Doppler first proposed this effect in 1842 in his treatise &quot;Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels&quot; (On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens). The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by Buys Ballot in 1845. He confirmed that the sound&#x27;s pitch was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him. Hippolyte Fizeau discovered independently the same phenomenon on electromagnetic waves in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called &quot;effet Doppler-Fizeau&quot; but that name was not adopted by the rest of the world as Fizeau&#x27;s discovery was six years after Doppler&#x27;s proposal). In Britain, John Scott Russell made an experimental study of the Doppler effect (1848).

==General==

In classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the speed of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency formula_1 and emitted frequency formula_2 is given by:
formula_3
where
*formula_4 is the propagation speed of waves in the medium;
*formula_5 is the speed of the receiver relative to the medium. In the formula, formula_5 is added to formula_7 if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the receiver is moving away from the source;
*formula_8 is the speed of the source relative to the medium. formula_8 is subtracted from formula_7 if the source is moving towards the receiver, added if the source is moving away from the receiver.

Note this relationship predicts that the frequency will decrease if either source or receiver is moving away from the other.

Equivalently, under the assumption that the source is either directly approaching or receding from the observer:
formula_11
where 
*formula_12 is the wave&#x27;s speed relative to the receiver;
*formula_13 is the wave&#x27;s speed relative to the source;
*formula_14 is the wavelength.

If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant speed), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object&#x27;s emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.

If the speeds formula_8 and formula_16 are small compared to the speed of the wave, the relationship between observed frequency formula_1 and emitted frequency formula_2 is approximately

where
*formula_19
*formula_20 is the opposite of the relative speed of the receiver with respect to the source: it is positive when the source and the receiver are moving towards each other.

{c + v_\text{s}} \right) f_0&lt;/math&gt;

we divide for formula_7
formula_22

Since formula_23 we can substitute using the Taylor&#x27;s series expansion of formula_24 truncating all formula_25 and higher terms:
formula_26

When substituted in the last line, one gets:
formula_27

For small formula_8 and formula_29, the last term formula_30 becomes insignificant, hence:
formula_31

==Consequences==
Assuming a stationary observer and a wave source moving towards the observer at (or exceeding) the speed of the wave, the Doppler equation predicts an infinite (or negative) frequency as from the observer&#x27;s perspective. Thus, the Doppler equation is inapplicable for such cases. If the wave is a sound wave and the sound source is moving faster than the speed of sound, the resulting shock wave creates a sonic boom.

Lord Rayleigh predicted the following effect in his classic book on sound: if the observer were moving from the (stationary) source at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece &quot;previously&quot; emitted by that source would be heard in correct tempo and pitch, but as if played &quot;backwards&quot;.

==Applications==
===Sirens===

A siren on a passing emergency vehicle will start out higher than its stationary pitch, slide down as it passes, and continue lower than its stationary pitch as it recedes from the observer. Astronomer John Dobson explained the effect thus:

In other words, if the siren approached the observer directly, the pitch would remain constant, at a higher than stationary pitch, until the vehicle hit him, and then immediately jump to a new lower pitch. Because the vehicle passes by the observer, the radial speed does not remain constant, but instead varies as a function of the angle between his line of sight and the siren&#x27;s velocity:
formula_32
where formula_33 is the angle between the object&#x27;s forward velocity and the line of sight from the object to the observer.

===Astronomy===


The Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves such as light is of widespread use in astronomy to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us, resulting in so called blueshift or redshift, respectively. This may be used to detect if an apparently single star is, in reality, a close binary, to measure the rotational speed of stars and galaxies, or to detect exoplanets. This effect typically happens on a very small scale; there would not be a noticeable difference in visible light to the unaided eye.
The use of the Doppler effect in astronomy depends on knowledge of precise frequencies of discrete lines in the spectra of stars.

Among the nearby stars, the largest radial velocities with respect to the Sun are +308 km/s (BD-15°4041, also known as LHS 52, 81.7 light-years away) and −260 km/s (Woolley 9722, also known as Wolf 1106 and LHS 64, 78.2 light-years away). Positive radial speed means the star is receding from the Sun, negative that it is approaching.

The relationship between the expansion of the universe and the Doppler effect is not simple matter of the source moving away from the observer. In cosmology, the redshift of expansion is considered separate from redshifts due to gravity or Doppler motion.

Distant galaxies also exhibit peculiar motion distinct from their cosmological recession speeds. If redshifts are used to determine distances in accordance with Hubble&#x27;s law, then these peculiar motions give rise to redshift-space distortions.

===Radar===
The Doppler effect is used in some types of radar, to measure the velocity of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target – e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists – as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car&#x27;s speed. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.

Because the Doppler shift affects the wave incident upon the target as well as the wave reflected back to the radar, the change in frequency observed by a radar due to a target moving at relative speed formula_34 is twice that from the same target emitting a wave:
formula_35

===Medical===
An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce an accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.

Although &quot;Doppler&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;velocity measurement&quot; in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (&quot;when&quot; the received signal arrives).

Velocity measurements of blood flow are also used in other fields of medical ultrasonography, such as obstetric ultrasonography and neurology. Velocity measurement of blood flow in arteries and veins based on Doppler effect is an effective tool for diagnosis of vascular problems like stenosis.

===Flow measurement===
Instruments such as the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) have been developed to measure velocities in a fluid flow. The LDV emits a light beam and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow. The actual flow is computed as a function of the water velocity and phase. This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.

===Velocity profile measurement===
Developed originally for velocity measurements in medical applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure in real time complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.

===Satellites===
====Satellite navigation====

The Doppler shift can be exploited for satellite navigation such as in Transit and DORIS.

====Satellite communication====

Doppler also needs to be compensated in satellite communication. 
Fast moving satellites can have a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed progressively during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal. After realizing that the Doppler shift had not been considered before launch of the Huygens probe of the 2005 Cassini–Huygens mission, the probe trajectory was altered to approach Titan in such a way that its transmissions traveled perpendicular to its direction of motion relative to Cassini, greatly reducing the Doppler shift.

Doppler shift of the direct path can be estimated by the following formula:
formula_36
where formula_37 is the speed of the mobile station, formula_38 is the wavelength of the carrier, formula_39 is the elevation angle of the satellite and formula_33 is the driving direction with respect to the satellite.

The additional Doppler shift due to the satellite moving can be described as:
formula_41
where formula_42 is the relative speed of the satellite.

===Audio===
The Leslie speaker, most commonly associated with and predominantly used with the famous Hammond organ, takes advantage of the Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle. This results at the listener&#x27;s ear in rapidly fluctuating frequencies of a keyboard note.

===Vibration measurement===
A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact instrument for measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.

===Robotics===
Dynamic real-time path planning in robotics to aid the movement of robots in a sophisticated environment with moving obstacles often take help of Doppler effect. Such applications are specially used for competitive robotics where the environment is constantly changing, such as robosoccer.

==Inverse Doppler effect==
Since 1968 scientists such as Victor Veselago have speculated about the possibility of an inverse Doppler effect. The size of the Doppler shift depends on the refractive index of the medium a wave is traveling through. Some materials are capable of negative refraction, which should lead to a Doppler shift that works in a direction opposite that of a conventional Doppler shift. The first experiment that detected this effect was conducted by Nigel Seddon and Trevor Bearpark in Bristol, United Kingdom in 2003. Later, the inverse Doppler effect was observed in some inhomogeneous materials, and predicted inside a Vavilov–Cherenkov cone.

<doc id="8727" wikidata="Q1184932" url="?curid=8727" title="ΔT (timekeeping)">
<text>In precise timekeeping, Δ&quot;T (Delta &quot;T, delta-&quot;T,delta&quot;T, or D&quot;T&quot;) is a measure of the cumulative effect of the departure of the Earth&#x27;s rotation period from the fixed-length day of International Atomic Time (86,400 seconds). Formally, Δ&quot;T&quot; is the time difference between Universal Time (UT, defined by Earth&#x27;s rotation) and Terrestrial Time (TT, independent of Earth&#x27;s rotation). The value of ΔT for the start of 1902 was approximately zero; for 2002 it was about 64 seconds. So Earth&#x27;s rotations over that century took about 64 seconds longer than would be required for days of atomic time. As well as this long-term drift in the length of the day there are short-term fluctuations in the length of day () which are dealt with separately.

Since early 2017, the length of the day has happened to be very close to the conventional value, and ΔT has remained within half a second of 69 seconds.

==Calculation==
Earth&#x27;s rotational speed is , and a day corresponds to one period . A rotational acceleration gives a rate of change of the period of , which is usually expressed as . This has dimension of reciprocal time and is commonly reported in units of milliseconds-per-day per century, symbolized as ms/day/cy (understood as (ms/day)/cy). Integrating gives an expression for Δ&quot;T&quot; against time.

===Universal time===
Universal Time is a time scale based on the Earth&#x27;s rotation, which is somewhat irregular over short periods (days up to a century), thus any time based on it cannot have an accuracy better than 1 in 108. However, a larger, more consistent effect has been observed over many centuries: Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation is inexorably slowing down. This observed change in the rate of rotation is attributable to two primary forces, one decreasing and one increasing the Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation. Over the long term, the dominating force is tidal friction, which is slowing the rate of rotation, contributing about ms/day/cy or ms/cy, which is equal to the very small fractional change day/day. The most important force acting in the opposite direction, to speed up the rate, is believed to be a result of the melting of continental ice sheets at the end of the last glacial period. This removed their tremendous weight, allowing the land under them to begin to rebound upward in the polar regions, an effect that is still occurring today and will continue until isostatic equilibrium is reached. This &quot;post-glacial rebound&quot; brings mass closer to the rotational axis of the Earth, which makes the Earth spin faster, according to the law of conservation of angular momentum, similar to an ice skater pulling their arms in to spin faster. Models estimate this effect to contribute about −0.6 ms/day/cy. Combining these two effects, the net acceleration (actually a deceleration) of the rotation of the Earth, or the change in the length of the mean solar day (LOD), is +1.7 ms/day/cy or +62 s/cy2 or +46.5 ns/day2. This matches the average rate derived from astronomical records over the past 27 centuries.

===Terrestrial time===
Terrestrial Time is a theoretical uniform time scale, defined to provide continuity with the former Ephemeris Time (ET). ET was an independent time-variable, proposed (and its adoption agreed) in the period 1948–1952 with the intent of forming a gravitationally uniform time scale as far as was feasible at that time, and depending for its definition on Simon Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot; (1895), interpreted in a new way to accommodate certain observed discrepancies. Newcomb&#x27;s tables formed the basis of all astronomical ephemerides of the Sun from 1900 through 1983: they were originally expressed (and published) in terms of Greenwich Mean Time and the mean solar day, but later, in respect of the period 1960–1983, they were treated as expressed in terms of ET, in accordance with the adopted ET proposal of 1948–52. ET, in turn, can now be seen (in light of modern results) as close to the average mean solar time between 1750 and 1890 (centered on 1820), because that was the period during which the observations on which Newcomb&#x27;s tables were based were performed. While TT is strictly uniform (being based on the SI second, every second is the same as every other second), it is in practice realised by International Atomic Time (TAI) with an accuracy of about 1 part in 1014.

==Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation==
Earth&#x27;s rate of rotation must be integrated to obtain time, which is Earth&#x27;s angular position (specifically, the orientation of the meridian of Greenwich relative to the fictitious mean sun). Integrating +1.7 ms/d/cy and centering the resulting parabola on the year 1820 yields (to a first approximation) seconds for Δ&quot;T&quot;. Smoothed historical measurements of Δ&quot;T&quot; using total solar eclipses are about +17190 s in the year −500 (501 BC), +10580 s in 0 (1 BC), +5710 s in 500, +1570 s in 1000, and +200 s in 1500. After the invention of the telescope, measurements were made by observing occultations of stars by the Moon, which allowed the derivation of more closely spaced and more accurate values for Δ&quot;T&quot;. Δ&quot;T&quot; continued to decrease until it reached a plateau of +11 ± 6 s between 1680 and 1866. For about three decades immediately before 1902 it was negative, reaching −6.64 s. Then it increased to +63.83 s in January 2000 and +68.97 s in January 2018 and +69.361 s in January 2020, after even a slight decrease from 69.358 s in July 2019 to 69.338 s in September and October 2019 and a new increase in November and December 2019. This will require the addition of an ever-greater number of leap seconds to UTC as long as UTC tracks UT1 with one-second adjustments. (The SI second as now used for UTC, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) Physically, the meridian of Greenwich in Universal Time is almost always to the east of the meridian in Terrestrial Time, both in the past and in the future. +17190 s or about  h corresponds to 71.625°E. This means that in the year −500 (501 BC), Earth&#x27;s faster rotation would cause a total solar eclipse to occur 71.625° to the east of the location calculated using the uniform TT.

==Values prior to 1955==
All values of Δ&quot;T&quot; before 1955 depend on observations of the Moon, either via eclipses or occultations. The angular momentum lost by the Earth due to friction induced by the Moon&#x27;s tidal effect is transferred to the Moon, increasing its angular momentum, which means that its moment arm (approximately its distance from the Earth, i.e. precisely the semi-major axis of the Moon&#x27;s orbit) is increased (for the time being about +3.8 cm/year), which via Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion causes the Moon to revolve around the Earth at a slower rate. The cited values of Δ&quot;T&quot; assume that the lunar acceleration (actually a deceleration, that is a negative acceleration) due to this effect is = −26″/cy2, where is the mean sidereal angular motion of the Moon. This is close to the best estimate for as of 2002 of −25.858 ± 0.003″/cy2, so Δ&quot;T&quot; need not be recalculated given the uncertainties and smoothing applied to its current values. Nowadays, UT is the observed orientation of the Earth relative to an inertial reference frame formed by extra-galactic radio sources, modified by an adopted ratio between sidereal time and solar time. Its measurement by several observatories is coordinated by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

== Current values ==
Recall by definition. While TT is only theoretical, it is commonly realized as TAI + 32.184 seconds where TAI is UTC plus the current leap seconds, so .

This can be rewritten as , where DUT1 is UT1 − UTC. The value of DUT1 is sent out in the weekly IERS Bulletin A, as well as several time signal services, and by extension serve as a source of the current .

== Geological evidence ==
Tidal deceleration rates have varied over the history of the Earth-Moon system. Analysis of layering in fossil mollusc shells from 70 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, shows that there were 372 days a year, and thus that the day was about 23.5 hours long then. Based on geological studies of tidal rhythmites, the day was 21.9±0.4 hours long 620 million years ago and there were 13.1±0.1 synodic months/year and 400±7 solar days/year. The average recession rate of the Moon between then and now has been 2.17±0.31 cm/year, which is about half the present rate. The present high rate may be due to near resonance between natural ocean frequencies and tidal frequencies.

<text>David Elieser Deutsch ( ; born 18 May 1953) is a British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a visiting professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

==Early life and education==
Deutsch was born to a Jewish family in Haifa, Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. In London, David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (his parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood Broadway), followed by William Ellis School in Highgate before reading Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge and taking Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. He went on to Wolfson College, Oxford for his doctorate in theoretical physics, about quantum field theory in curved space-time, supervised by Dennis Sciama and Philip Candelas.

==Career and research==
His work on quantum algorithms began with a 1985 paper, later expanded in 1992 along with Richard Jozsa, to produce the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm. In his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008, his contributions were described as:

Since 2012, he has been working on constructor theory, an attempt at generalizing the quantum theory of computation to cover not just computation but all physical processes. Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled &quot;Constructor theory of information&quot;, that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.

===&quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;===
In his 1997 book &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, Deutsch details his &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;. It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among multiversal, computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat emergentist rather than reductive. There are four strands to his theory:

# Hugh Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, &quot;the first and most important of the four strands.&quot;
# Karl Popper&#x27;s epistemology, especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a realist (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.
# Alan Turing&#x27;s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch&#x27;s Turing principle, in which the Universal Turing machine is replaced by Deutsch&#x27;s universal quantum computer. (&quot;&quot;The&quot; theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.&quot;)
# Richard Dawkins&#x27; refinement of Darwinian evolutionary theory and the modern evolutionary synthesis, especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the epistemological strand).

=== Invariants ===
In a 2009 TED talk, Deutsch expounded a criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: &quot;State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions]&quot;.
: &quot;A bad explanation is easy to vary.&quot;
: &quot;The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress&quot;
: &quot;That is the most important fact about the physical world.&quot;

Invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality has long been part of philosophy of science: for example, Friedel Weinert&#x27;s book &quot;The Scientist as Philosopher&quot; (2004) noted the presence of the theme in many writings from around 1900 onward, such as works by Henri Poincaré (1902), Ernst Cassirer (1920), Max Born (1949 and 1953), Paul Dirac (1958), Olivier Costa de Beauregard (1966), Eugene Wigner (1967), Lawrence Sklar (1974), Michael Friedman (1983), John D. Norton (1992), Nicholas Maxwell (1993), Alan Cook (1994), Alistair Cameron Crombie (1994), Margaret Morrison (1995), Richard Feynman (1997), Robert Nozick (2001), and Tim Maudlin (2002).

===&quot;The Beginning of Infinity&quot;===
Deutsch&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World&quot;, was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, he views the European Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries as near the beginning of a potentially unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of knowledge, memes, and how and why creativity evolved in humans.

===Awards and honours===
&quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; was shortlisted for the Rhone-Poulenc science book award in 1998. Deutsch was awarded the Dirac Prize of the Institute of Physics in 1998, and the Edge of Computation Science Prize in 2005. In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). Deutsch is linked to Paul Dirac through his doctoral advisor Dennis Sciama, whose doctoral advisor was Dirac. Deutsch was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008. In 2018, he received the Micius Quantum Prize. In 2021, he was awarded the Isaac Newton Medal and Prize. On September 22, 2022, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, sharing it with 3 others.

== Personal life ==
Deutsch is a founding member of the parenting and educational method Taking Children Seriously.

=== Views on Brexit ===
Deutsch supported Brexit, with his advocacy quoted by then-government adviser, Dominic Cummings, and reported by The New Yorker magazine in January 2020. 

Michael Gove mentioned Deutsch&#x27;s viewpoint during a BBC Brexit debate. Regarding the debate, Deutsch later commented:
&quot;In Britain there is a clear path if you have a grievance, you can join a pressure-group, the pressure-group will pressure the government, or you can see your MP, and the MP will see the grievance building up, and so-on. Whereas, Europe is structured in such a way that it&#x27;s very difficult to know whom to address your grievance to, or what they could do about it.&quot; 

Deutsch was not involved in any campaign advocacy for Brexit. His public remarks on the subject were quoted by Cummings and Gove on their own initiative, as Deutsch later made clear.

<text>The (; &quot;people&#x27;s storm&quot;) was a &quot;levée en masse&quot; national militia established by Nazi Germany during the last months of World War II. It was set up by the Nazi Party on the orders of Adolf Hitler and established on 25 September 1944. It was staffed by conscripting males between the ages of 16 and 60 years, who were not already serving in some military unit. 

The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; comprised one of the final components of the total war promulgated by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, part of a Nazi endeavor to overcome their enemies&#x27; military strength through force of will. &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units fought unsuccessful battles against Allied forces at the end of the war. On several occasions, its members participated in atrocities, accompanied by German civilians and the Hitler Youth, which were overseen by members of the SS or &quot;Gaue&quot; leaders.

==Origins and organisation==


The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; drew inspiration from the Prussian &quot;Landsturm&quot; of 1813–1815, that fought in the liberation wars against Napoleon, mainly as guerrilla forces. Plans to form a &quot;Landsturm&quot; national militia in eastern Germany as a last resort to boost fighting strength were first proposed in 1944 by General Heinz Guderian, chief of the German General Staff. The army did not have enough men to resist the Soviet onslaught. So, additional categories of men were called into service, including those in non-essential jobs, those previously deemed unfit, over-age, or under-age, and those recovering from wounds. The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; had existed, on paper, since around 1925, but it was only after Hitler ordered Martin Bormann to recruit six million men for this militia that the group became a physical reality. While the regime formally established the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; on 25 September, it was not announced to the public until 16 October 1944. The official launch date was two days later, 18 October 1944 and was chosen by Heinrich Himmler to evoke parallels with the popular uprising which, according to popular legend, ended French rule over Germany and culminated in the Battle of Leipzig on the same date in 1813. Despite the appeal for this last-ditch effort, the intended strength of &quot;six million&quot; members was never attained.

Joseph Goebbels and other propagandists depicted the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; as an outburst of enthusiasm and the will to resist. Historian Daniel Blatman writes that the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; was portrayed as the &quot;incarnation&quot; of the greater &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, whereby &quot;all differences in social status, origin, or age vanish and unite all people on the basis of race. It was the service framework for members of the local community, who had been raised together and lived side by side, and now bore arms together in order to defend the community.&quot; In some regards, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; was the culmination of Goebbels&#x27; &quot;total war&quot; speech of February 1943 and its formation was &quot;given a big build-up&quot; in the November 1944 newsreel episode of &quot;Die Deutsche Wochenschau&quot;. Consistent messages of final victory from various Nazi media outlets accompanying the &quot;Volkssturm&#x27;s&quot; creation provided a psychological rallying point for the civilian population. While it had some marginal effect on morale, it was undermined by the recruits&#x27; visible lack of uniforms and weaponry. Nazi themes of death, transcendence, and commemoration were given full play to encourage the fight. Many German civilians realised that this was a desperate attempt to turn the course of the war. Sardonic old men would remark, &quot;We old monkeys are the &quot;Führer&quot;’s newest weapon&quot; (in German this rhymes: &quot;Wir alten Affen sind des Führers neue Waffen&quot;). A popular joke about the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; went &quot;Why is the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; Germany&#x27;s most precious resource? Because its members have silver in their hair, gold in their mouths, and lead in their bones.&quot;

For these militia units to be effective, they needed not only strength in numbers, but also fanaticism. During the early stages of &quot;Volkssturm&quot; planning, it became apparent that units lacking morale would lack combat effectiveness. To generate fanaticism, &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units were placed under the direct command of local Nazi Party officials, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Kreisleiter&quot;. The new &quot;Volkssturm&quot; was also to become a nationwide organisation, with Heinrich Himmler as Replacement Army commander, responsible for armaments and training. Though nominally under party control, &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units were placed under &quot;Heer&quot; command when engaged in action. At the Reich level, the SS and the Party Chancellery agreed to share responsibility between them. Himmler retained responsibility for military equipment and training while Bormann, head of the Party Chancellery, was charged with oversight of administration and political indoctrination. Aware that a &quot;people&#x27;s army&quot; would not be able to withstand the onslaught of the modern army wielded by the Allies, Hitler issued the following order towards the end of 1944:
 Experience in the East has shown that &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, emergency and reserve units have little fighting value when left to themselves, and can be quickly destroyed. The fighting value of these units, which are for the most part strong in numbers, but weak in the armaments required for modern battle, is immeasurably higher when they go into action with troops of the regular army in the field. I, therefore, order: where &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, emergency, and reserve units are available, together with regular units, in any battle sector, mixed battle-groups (brigades) will be formed under unified command, so as to give the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, emergency, and reserve units stiffening and support.

With the Nazi Party in charge of organising the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, each &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, or Nazi Party District Leader, was charged with the leadership, enrollment, and organisation of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; in their district. The largest &quot;Volkssturm&quot; unit seems to have corresponded to the next smaller territorial subdivision of the Nazi Party organisation—the &quot;Kreis&quot;. The basic unit was a battalion of 642 men. Units were mostly composed of members of the Hitler Youth, invalids, the elderly, or men who had previously been considered unfit for military service. On 12 February 1945, the Nazis conscripted German women and girls into the auxiliaries of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Correspondingly, girls as young as 14 years were trained in the use of small arms, &quot;Panzerfausts&quot;, machine guns, and hand grenades from December 1944 through May 1945.

Municipal organisation:
* A &quot;Bataillon &quot; (battalion) in every &quot;Kreis&quot; (roughly equivalent to a U.S. county; there were 920 &quot;Kreise&quot; in Greater Germany)
* A &quot;Kompanie&quot; (company) in every &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (the &quot;local chapter&quot; of the Nazi Party). 
* A &quot;Zug&quot; (platoon) in every &quot;Zelle&quot; (literally a &quot;cell&quot; of Party members; roughly equivalent to a U.S. precinct) 
* A &quot;Gruppe&quot; (squad) in every &quot;Block&quot; (city block) 

Each &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Kreisleiter&quot; had a &quot;Volkssturm&quot; Chief of Staff.

From the militia&#x27;s inception until the spring of 1945, Himmler and Bormann engaged in a power-struggle over the jurisdictional control over the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; regarding security and police powers in Germany and the occupied territories; a contest which Himmler and the SS more or less won on one level (police and security), but lost to Bormann on another (mobilising reserve forces). Historian David Yelton described the situation as two ranking officers at the helm of a sinking ship fighting over command.

Benito Mussolini suggested, through his son Vittorio, then general secretary of the Republican Fascist Party&#x27;s German branch, that 30,000 Italians should be added to the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; in the defence of Germany. However, no evidence exists that this offer was implemented.

==Uniforms and insignia==

The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; &quot;uniform&quot; was only a black armband with the German words &quot;Deutscher Volkssturm Wehrmacht&quot; (&quot;German People&#x27;s Storm, (of the) Armed Forces&quot;). The German government tried to issue as many of its members as possible with military uniforms of all sorts, ranging from &quot;Feldgrau&quot; to camouflage types. An example of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;&#x27;s piecemeal outfitting occurred in the Rhineland, where one unit was provided with &quot;pre-war black SS uniforms, brown Organization Todt coats, blue Luftwaffe auxiliary caps, and French Adrian helmets.&quot; Most members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, especially elderly members, had no uniforms and were not supplied, so they generally wore either work uniforms (including railway workers, policemen, and firemen), Hitler Youth uniforms, old uniforms or parts of uniforms from the First World War, or their civilian clothing and usually carried with them their own personal rucksacks, blankets, cooking-equipment, etc.

==Ranks==
The simple paramilitary insignia of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; were as follows:
==Training and impact==
Typically, members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; received only very basic military training. It included a brief indoctrination and training on the use of basic weapons such as the Karabiner 98k rifle and &quot;Panzerfaust&quot;. Because of continuous fighting and weapon shortages, weapon training was often minimal. There was also a lack of instructors, meaning that weapons training was sometimes done by World War I veterans drafted into service themselves. Often &quot;Volkssturm&quot; members were only able to familiarise themselves with their weapons when in actual combat.

There was no standardisation of any kind and units were issued only what equipment was available. This was true of every form of equipment—&quot;Volkssturm&quot; members were required to bring their own uniforms and culinary equipment etc. This resulted in the units looking very ragged and, instead of boosting civilian morale, it often reminded people of Germany&#x27;s desperate state. Armament was equally haphazard: though some Karabiner 98ks were on hand, members were also issued older Gewehr 98s, Steyr-Mannlicher M1895s, 19th-century Gewehr 71s, and Steyr-Mannlicher M1888s, as well as Dreyse M1907 pistols. In addition there was a plethora of Soviet, British, Belgian, French, Italian, and other weapons that had been captured by German forces during the war. The Germans had also developed cheap &quot;Volkssturm&quot; weapons, such as MP 3008 machine pistols and &quot;Volkssturmgewehr&quot; rifles. These were completely stamped and machine-pressed constructions (in the 1940s, industrial processes were much cruder than today, so a firearm needed great amounts of semi-artisanal work to be actually reliable). The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; troops were nominally supplied when and where possible by both the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the SS. By the end of January 1945, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; had only accumulated 40,500 rifles and 2,900 machine guns amid this mish-mash of foreign and outdated assemblage of weapons.

When units had completed their training and received armament, members took a customary oath to Hitler and were then dispatched into combat. Teenagers and middle-aged men were sent to separate training camps, some of whom received as little as ten to fourteen days of training before being sent to fight. Unlike most English-speaking countries, Germany had universal military service for all young men for several generations, so many of the older members would have had at least basic military training from when they served in the German Army and many would have been veterans of the First World War. &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units were supposed to be used only in their own districts, but many were sent directly to the front lines. Ultimately, it was their charge to confront the overwhelming power of the British, Canadian, Soviet, American, and French armies alongside &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces to either turn the tide of the war or set a shining example for future generations of Germans and expunge the defeat of 1918 by fighting to the last, dying before surrendering. It was an apocalyptic goal which some of those assigned to the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; took to heart. Unremittingly fanatical members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; refused to abandon the Nazi ethos unto the dying days of Nazi Germany, and in a number of instances took brutal &quot;police actions&quot; against German civilians deemed defeatists or cowards.

Losses were high among the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; – Battalion 25/235 for instance, started out with 400 men but fought on until there were only 10 men remaining. Fighting at Küstrin between 30 January to 29 March 1945, militia units made up mostly of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; resisted for nearly two months. Losses were upwards of 60 percent for the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; at Kolberg, roughly 1,900 of them died at Breslau, and during the Battle of Königsberg, another 2,400 members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; were killed. At other times along the western front particularly, &quot;Volkssturm&quot; troops would cast their arms aside and disappear into the chaos.

Many units lost their enthusiasm for the fight when it became clear that the Allies had won, prompting them to lay down their weapons and surrender – they also feared being captured by Allied forces and tortured or executed as partisans. Duty to their communities also played a part in their capitulation, as did self-preservation.

==Battle of Berlin==

Their most extensive use was during the Battle of Berlin, where &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units fought in many parts of the city. This battle was particularly devastating to its formations; however, many members fought to the death out of fear of being captured by the Soviets. The &quot;Volkssturm&quot; had a strength of about 60,000 in the Berlin area, formed into 92 battalions, of which about 30 battalions of &quot;Volkssturm I&quot; (those with some weapons) were sent to forward positions, while those of &quot;Volkssturm II&quot; (those without weapons) remained in the inner city. One of the few substantive fighting units left to defend Berlin was the LVI Panzer Corps, which occupied the southeastern sector of the town, whereas the remaining parts of the city were being defended by what remained of the SS, the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, and the Hitler Youth formations. Nonetheless, a force of over 2.5 million Soviet troops, equipped with 6,250 tanks and over 40,000 artillery pieces, were assigned to capture the city, and the diminished remnants of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; were no match for them. Meanwhile, Hitler denounced every perceived &quot;betrayal&quot; to the inhabitants of the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Not eager to die what was thought to be a pointless death, many older members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; looked for places to hide from the approaching Soviet Army. 

One notable and unusual &quot;Volkssturm&quot; unit in the Battle for Berlin was the 3/115 Siemensstadt Battalion. It comprised 770 men, mostly World War I veterans in their 50s who were reasonably fit factory workers, with experienced officers. Unlike most &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units it was quite well equipped and trained. It was formed into three rifle companies, a support company (with two infantry support guns, four infantry mortars, and heavy machine guns), and a heavy weapons company (with four Soviet M-20 howitzers and a French De Bange 220mm mortar). The battalion first engaged Soviet troops at Friedrichsfelde on 21 April and saw the heaviest fighting over the following two days. It held out until 2 May, by which time it was down to just 50 rifles and two light machine guns. The survivors fell back to join other &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units. 26 men from the battalion were awarded the Iron Cross. Allied bombing and Soviet artillery had reduced Berlin to rubble; meanwhile the final stand in Berlin dwindled to fighting against highly trained, battle-hardened Soviet troops on the brink of final victory, who viewed resistance fighters like the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; as terrorists in much the same way the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; once had viewed potential partisans during Operation Barbarossa. Red Army soldiers called the Hitler Youth formations and members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; still fighting to the end in Berlin &quot;totals&quot; for being part of Germany&#x27;s total mobilisation effort.

==Role in atrocities==
On several occasions, members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; participated in atrocities. During January 1945, thousands of prisoners were evacuated and force-marched from several smaller concentration camps—which included Jesau, Seerappen, Schippenbeil, Gerdauen, and Helgenbeil—near Königsberg, many dying along the way. Upon reaching Palmnicken, some 2,500 to 3,000 prisoners of the 5,000 that originally began the journey were lodged in a factory. Mayor and local Nazi party chief, Kurt Friedrichs wanted the SS to send these prisoners on their way since the Red Army was not far away. When local &quot;Volkssturm&quot; leader Hans Feyerabend was ordered to transport the suffering prisoners out of the town, he refused to carry out the order and was heard exclaiming that he would not permit a massacre like the one at Katyń forest. Feyerabend even assigned &quot;Volkssturm&quot; guards to keep watch on the local Nazi party members, but this proved fruitless when Friedrich armed a group of Hitler Youth and likewise summoned the local SD elements, whose leaders then commanded the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; to help evacuate the prisoners. On 30 January 1945, after the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; left with Friedrich in charge, Feyerabend committed suicide; then between 30 January and 1 February the prisoners were murdered by the remaining assemblage of SS guards, Hitler Youth, and the local &quot;Volkssturm&quot; unit.

When prisoners fell sick with typhus in Reichsgau Steiermark during February–March 1945, SS men, Hitler Youth, and &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units systematically murdered them. Under the orders of Loeben-district Kreisleiter, Otto Christandl, &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units in nearby Graz and Eisenerz assisted the Gestapo and Ukrainian &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops in evacuating between 6,000 and 8,000 prisoners—being marched towards Mauthausen—from their region, many of whom were murdered during the journey when they collapsed from exhaustion.

Sometime in early April 1945 as Allied forces approached the Mittelwerk facilities—where V2 rockets were being produced—the slave labourers from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp were force-marched from the western Harz by a collection of guards drawn from the military, the Hitler Youth, and the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Approximately north of Magdeburg, in the village of Mieste, this motley assemblage of guards locked a thousand of these prisoners in a barn and burned them alive at the instruction of a local Nazi Party leader; this event came to be known as the Gardelegen massacre. At the town of Celle in Lower Saxony around the same time, members of the SS, SA, local police, Hitler Youth, and &quot;Volkssturm&quot; were aided by locals to &quot;hunt down and shoot&quot; prisoners who had fled into the local woodland after their transport train was bombed.

Interrogated members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;—when questioned as to where the regular forces had gone—revealed that German soldiers surrendered to the Americans and British instead of the Red Army for fear of reprisals related to the atrocities they had committed in the Soviet Union.

==Final phase==

While Iron Crosses were being handed out in places like Berlin, other cities and towns like Parchim and Mecklenburg witnessed old elites, acting as military commandants over the Hitler Youth and &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, asserting themselves and demanding that the defensive fighting stop so as to spare lives and property. Despite their efforts, the last four months of the war were an exercise in futility for the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;, and the Nazi leadership&#x27;s insistence to continue the fight to the bitter end contributed to an additional 1.23 million (approximated) deaths, half of them German military personnel and the other half from the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;.

In many small towns, when leading members of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; refused to fight on against the superior forces of the Allies—part of an attempt to circumvent the &quot;total destruction&quot; of their home regions—they were tried and &quot;summarily hanged&quot; by party activists. During the spring of 1945, thousands of &quot;Volkssturm&quot; members were killed like this by Nazi Party fanatics in Franken.

<text>In public use, a director&#x27;s cut is the director&#x27;s preferred version of a film (or video game, television episode, music video, commercial, &quot;etc.&quot;). It is generally considered a marketing term to represent the version of a film the director prefers, and is usually used as contrast to a theatrical release where the director did not have final cut privilege and did not agree with what was released. (&quot;Cut&quot; explicitly refers to the editing process.)

Most of the time, film directors do not have the &quot;final cut&quot; (final say on the version released to the public). Those with money invested in the film, such as the production companies, distributors, or studios, may make changes intended to make the film more profitable at the box office. In extreme cases that can sometimes mean a different ending, less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting rating, but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day.

With the rise of home video, the phrase became more generically used as a marketing term to communicate to consumers that this is the director&#x27;s preferred edit of a film, and it implies the director was not happy with the version that was originally released. Sometimes there are big disagreements between the director&#x27;s vision and the producer&#x27;s vision, and the director&#x27;s preferred edit is sought after by fans (for example Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil&quot;).

Not all films have separate &quot;director&#x27;s cuts&quot; (often the director is happy with the theatrical release, even if they didn&#x27;t have final cut privilege), and sometimes separate versions of films are released as &quot;director&#x27;s cuts&quot; even if the director doesn&#x27;t prefer them. Once such example is Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot;, which had a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; released in 2003, even though the director said it was purely for &quot;marketing purposes&quot; and didn&#x27;t represent his preferred vision for the film.

Sometimes alternate edits are released, which are not necessarily director&#x27;s preferred cuts, but which showcase different visions for the project for fans to enjoy. Examples include James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;, which was released as both a &quot;Special Edition&quot; and &quot;Extended&quot; cuts, and Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, which were released on home video as &quot;Extended Editions&quot;. These versions do not represent the director&#x27;s preferred visions.

The term since expanded to include media such as video games, comic books and music albums (the latter two of which don&#x27;t actually have directors).

== Original use of the phrase ==
Within the industry itself, a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; refers to a stage in the editing process, and is not usually what a director wants to release to the public, due to the fact it is unfinished. The editing process of a film is broken into stages: First is the assembly/rough cut, where all selected takes are put together in the order in which they should appear in the film. Next, the editor&#x27;s cut is reduced from the rough cut; the editor may be guided by their own choices or following notes from the director or producers. Eventually is the final cut, which actually gets released or broadcast. In between the editor&#x27;s cut and the final cut can come any number of fine cuts, including the director&#x27;s cut. The director&#x27;s cut may include unsatisfactory takes, a preliminary soundtrack, a lack of desired pick-up shots etc., which the director would not like to be shown but uses as a placeholder until satisfactory replacements can be inserted. This is still how the term is used within the film industry, as well as commercials, television, and music videos.

== Inception ==
The trend of releasing alternate cuts of films for artistic reasons became prominent in the 1970s; in 1974, the &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was shown theatrically in Los Angeles to sold-out audiences. The theatrical release of the film had cut 10 minutes to get an R rating, but this cut was hailed as superior and has now become the definitive one. Other early examples include George Lucas&#x27;s first two films being re-released following the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in cuts which more closely resembled his vision, or Peter Bogdanovich re-cutting &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; several times. Charlie Chaplin also re-released all of his films in the 1970s, several of which were re-cut (Chaplin&#x27;s re-release of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; in the 1940s is almost certainly the earliest prominent example of a director&#x27;s re-cut film being released to the public). A theatrical re-release of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; used the phrase &quot;Special Edition&quot; to describe a cut which was closer to Spielberg&#x27;s intent but had a compromised ending demanded by the studio.

As the home video industry rose in the early 1980s, video releases of director&#x27;s cuts were sometimes created for the small but dedicated cult fan market. Los Angeles cable station Z Channel is also cited as significant in the popularization of alternate cuts. Early examples of films released in this manner include Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, where a longer cut was recalled from theatres but subsequently shown on cable and eventually released to home video; James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot;, where a video release restored 20 minutes the studio had insisted on cutting; Cameron also voluntarily made cuts to the theatrical version of &quot;The Abyss&quot; for pacing but restored them for a video release, and most famously, Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, where an alternate workprint version was released to fan acclaim, ultimately resulting in the 1992 recut. Scott later recut the film once more, releasing a version dubbed &quot;The Final Cut&quot; in 2007. This was the final re-cut and the first in which Scott maintained creative control over the final product, leading to The Final Cut being considered the definitive version of the film.

== Criticism ==
Once distributors discovered that consumers would buy alternate versions of films, it became more common for films to have alternative versions released. And the original public meaning of a director&#x27;s preferred vision has become ignored, leading to so-called &quot;director&#x27;s cuts&quot; of films where the director prefers the theatrically released version (or when the director had actual final cut privilege in the first place). Such versions are often marketing ploys, assembled by simply restoring deleted scenes, sometimes adding as much as a half-hour to the length of the film without regard to pacing and storytelling.

As a result, the &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; is often considered a misnomer. Some directors deliberately try to avoid labelling alternate versions as such (e.g. Peter Jackson and James Cameron; each using the phrases &quot;Special Edition&quot; or &quot;Extended Edition&quot; for alternate versions of their films).

Sometimes the term is used a marketing ploy. For example, Ridley Scott states on the director&#x27;s commentary track of &quot;Alien&quot; that the original theatrical release was his &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;, and that the new version was released as a marketing ploy. Director Peter Bogdanovich, no stranger to director&#x27;s cuts himself, cites &quot;Red River&quot; as an example where 

Another way that released director&#x27;s cuts can be compromised is when directors were never allowed to even shoot their vision, and thus when the film is re-cut, they must make do with the footage that exists. Examples of this include Terry Zwigoff&#x27;s &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, Brian Helgeland&#x27;s &quot;Payback&quot;, and most notably the Richard Donner re-cut of &quot;Superman II&quot;. Donner completed about 75 per cent of the shooting of the sequel during the shooting of the first one but was fired from the project. His director&#x27;s cut of the film includes, among other things, screen test footage of stars Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, footage used in the first film, and entire scenes that were shot by replacement director Richard Lester which Donner dislikes but were required for story purposes.

On the other side, some critics (such as Roger Ebert) have approved of the use of the label in unsuccessful films that had been tampered with by studio executives, such as Sergio Leone&#x27;s original cut of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, and the moderately successful theatrical version of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, which were altered by studio interference for their theatrical release. Other well-received director&#x27;s cuts include Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine stating: &quot;The added 45 minutes in the Director’s Cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle&quot;), or Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;, where the restored 115-minute cut is closer to the director&#x27;s intent than the theatrical 105-minute cut (the actual director&#x27;s cut was 122 minutes; it was never completed to Peckinpah&#x27;s satisfaction, but was used as a guide for the restoration that was done after his death).

In some instances, such as Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot;, Robert Wise&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, John Cassavetes&#x27;s &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot;, Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Darling Lili&quot; and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Coda&quot;, changes made to a director&#x27;s cut resulted in a very similar runtime or a shorter, more compact cut. This generally happens when a distributor insists that a film be completed to meet a release date, but sometimes it is the result of removing scenes that the distributor insisted on inserting, as opposed to restoring scenes they insisted on cutting.

== Extended cuts and special editions ==
(See Changes in &quot;Star Wars&quot; re-releases and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial: The 20th Anniversary&quot;)

Separate to director&#x27;s cuts are alternate cuts released as &quot;special editions&quot; or &quot;extended cuts&quot;. These versions are often put together for home video for fans, and should not be confused with &#x27;director&#x27;s cuts&#x27;. For example, despite releasing extended versions of his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, Peter Jackson told IGN in 2019 that “the theatrical versions are the definitive versions, I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.”
James Cameron has shared similar sentiments regarding the special editions of his films, &quot;What I put into theaters is the Director&#x27;s Cut. Nothing was cut that I didn&#x27;t want cut. All the extra scenes we&#x27;ve added back in are just a bonus for the fans.&quot; Similar statements were made by Ridley Scott for the 2003 &#x27;director&#x27;s cut&#x27; of &quot;Alien&quot;.

Such alternate versions sometimes include changes to the special effects in addition to different editing, such as George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

Extended or special editions can also apply to films that have been extended for television or cut out to fill time slots and long advertisement breaks, against the explicit wishes of the director, such as the TV versions of &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

=== Examples of alternate cuts ===
&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series directed by Peter Jackson saw an &quot;Extended Edition&quot; release for each of the three films &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003) featuring an additional 30 minutes, 47 minutes and 51 minutes respectively of new scenes, special effects and music alongside fan-club credits. These versions of the films were not Jackson&#x27;s preferred edit, however, they were simply extended versions for fans to enjoy at home.

&quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; directed by Zack Snyder had an &quot;Ultimate Edition,&quot; which added back 31 minutes of footage cut for the theatrical release and received an R rating, released digitally on 28 June 2016, and on Blu-ray on 19 July 2016.

The film &quot;Justice League&quot; which suffered a very troubled production, was begun by Snyder, who completed a pre-postproduction director&#x27;s cut but had to step down before completing the project due to his daughter&#x27;s death. Joss Whedon was hired by the films&#x27; distributor Warner Bros. Pictures to complete the film, which was however heavily re-shot, re-edited and released in 2017 with Snyder retaining the directorial credit, to negative reception from general audience, fans and critics alike and a box office failure. Following a global fan campaign to which the director and members of the cast and crew showed support, Snyder was allowed to return and complete the project the way he intended it and a 4-hour version of the film dubbed &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; with some additionally shot scenes at the end was released on March 18, 2021, on HBO Max to more favorable reviews than the original version. Snyder originally teased a 214-minute cut of the film that was supposed to be the theatrical version released in 2017 if he did not step down from the project.
Snyder has also confirmed that his Netflix distributed sci-fi film &quot;Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire&quot; (2023) and its sequel &quot;Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver&quot; (2024) would receive R-rated director&#x27;s cuts with its new titles &quot;Rebel Moon – Chapter One: Chalice of Blood&quot;, and the sequel &quot;Rebel Moon – Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness&quot; (both 2024). The PG-13 initial versions of those films having been critically panned.

The film &quot;Caligula&quot; exists in at least 10 different officially released versions, ranging from a sub-90-minute television edit version of TV-14 (later TV-MA) for cable television to an unrated full pornographic version exceeding 3.5 hours. This is believed to be the largest amount of distinct versions of a single film. Among major studio films, the record is believed to be held by &quot;Blade Runner&quot;; the magazine &quot;Video Watchdog&quot; counted no less than seven distinct versions in a 1993 issue, before director Ridley Scott later released a &quot;Final Cut&quot; in 2007 to acclaim from critics including Roger Ebert who included it on his great movies list, The release of &quot;Blade Runner: The Final Cut&quot; brings the supposed grand total to eight differing versions of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

Upon its release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2019, &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; featured an extended cut with seven minutes of additional footage. This is the first time since &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; that a Wizarding World film has had one.

An animated example of an extended cut without the approval of the director was 1983&#x27;s &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, which was extended to have more profanity (supervised by co-writer and producer Bill Couturié) as opposed to co-director John Korty&#x27;s original.

The Coen Brothers&#x27; &quot;Blood Simple&quot; is one of few examples that demonstrate director&#x27;s cuts are not necessarily longer.

== Music videos ==

The music video for the 2006 Academy Award-nominated song &quot;Listen&quot;, performed by Beyoncé, received a director&#x27;s cut by Diane Martel. This version of the video was later included on Knowles&#x27; &quot;B&#x27;Day Anthology Video Album&quot; (2007). Linkin Park has a director&#x27;s cut version for their music video &quot;Faint&quot; (directed by Mark Romanek) in which one of the band members spray paints the words &quot;En Proceso&quot; on a wall, as well as Hoobastank also having one for 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Reason&quot; which omits the woman getting hit by the car. Britney Spears&#x27; music video for 2007&#x27;s &quot;Gimme More&quot; was first released as a director&#x27;s cut on iTunes, with the official video released 3 days later. Many other director&#x27;s cut music videos contain sexual content that can&#x27;t be shown on TV thus creating alternative scenes, such as Thirty Seconds to Mars&#x27;s &quot;Hurricane&quot;, and in some cases, alternative videos, such as in the case of Spears&#x27; 2008 video for &quot;Womanizer&quot;.

== Expanded usage in pop culture ==
As the trend became more widely recognized, the term &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; became increasingly used as a colloquialism to refer to an expanded version of other things, including video games, music, and comic books. This confusing usage only served to further reduce the artistic value of a director&#x27;s cut, and it is currently rarely used in those ways.

=== Video games ===

For video games, these expanded versions, also referred as &quot;complete editions&quot;, will have additions to the gameplay or additional game modes and features outside the main portion of the game.

As is the case with certain high-profile Japanese-produced games, the game designers may take the liberty to revise their product for the overseas market with additional features during the localization process. These features are later added back to the native market in a re-release of a game in what is often referred as the international version of the game. This was the case with the overseas versions of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Rogue Galaxy&quot;, which contained additional features (such as new difficulty settings for &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;), resulting in re-released versions of those respective games in Japan (&quot;Final Fantasy VII International&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Integral&quot; and &quot;Rogue Galaxy: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;). In the case of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, the American versions were released first, followed by the Japanese versions and then the European versions, with each regional release offering new content not found in the previous one. All of the added content from the Japanese and European versions of those games were included in the expanded editions titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence&quot;.

They also, similar to movies, will occasionally include extra, uncensored or alternate versions of cutscenes, as was the case with &quot;Resident Evil: Code Veronica X&quot;. In markets with strict censorship, a later relaxing of those laws occasional will result in the game being rereleased with the &quot;Special/Uncut Edition&quot; tag added to differentiate between the originally released censored version and the current uncensored edition.

Several of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games have also received director&#x27;s cuts and have used the term &quot;extension&quot;, though &quot;remake&quot; and &quot;third version&quot; are also often used by many fans. These include &quot;Pocket Monsters: Blue&quot; (Japan only), &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; (for &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;/&quot;Blue&quot;), &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot; (for &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;), &quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot; (for &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;), &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot; (for &quot;&quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;&quot;) and &quot;Pokémon Ultra Sun&quot; and &quot;Ultra Moon&quot;.

For their PlayStation 5 &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; releases of the PlayStation 4 games &quot;Ghost of Tsushima&quot; and &quot;Death Stranding&quot; both received expanded features on both games.

=== Music ===
&quot;Director&#x27;s cuts&quot; in music are rarely released. A few exceptions include Guided by Voices&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Bee Thousand&quot;, which was re-released as a three disc vinyl LP director&#x27;s cut in 2004, and Fall Out Boy&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Take This to Your Grave&quot;, which was re-released as a Director&#x27;s cut in 2005 with two extra tracks.

In 2011 British singer Kate Bush released the album titled &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. It is made up of songs from her earlier albums &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; which have been remixed and restructured, three of which were re-recorded completely.

<text>Digital video is an electronic representation of moving visual images (video) in the form of encoded digital data. This is in contrast to analog video, which represents moving visual images in the form of analog signals. Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession, usually at 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second. Digital video has many advantages such as easy copying, multicasting, sharing and storage.

Digital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard-definition component video signal in digital form. In addition to uncompressed formats, popular compressed digital video formats today include MPEG-2, H.264 and AV1. Modern interconnect standards used for playback of digital video include HDMI, DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI) and serial digital interface (SDI).

Digital video can be copied and reproduced with no degradation in quality. In contrast, when analog sources are copied, they experience generation loss. Digital video can be stored on digital media such as Blu-ray Disc, on computer data storage, or streamed over the Internet to end users who watch content on a personal computer or mobile device screen or a digital smart TV. Today, digital video content such as TV shows and movies also includes a digital audio soundtrack.

==History==
===Cameras===
The basis for digital video cameras is metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) image sensors. The first practical semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented in 1969 by Willard S. Boyle, who won a Nobel Prize for his work in physics. Following the commercialization of CCD sensors during the late 1970s to early 1980s, the entertainment industry slowly began transitioning to digital imaging and digital video from analog video over the next two decades. The CCD was followed by the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), developed in the 1990s.

Major films shot on digital video overtook those shot on film in 2013. Since 2016 over 90% of major films were shot on digital video. , 92% of films are shot on digital. Only 24 major films released in 2018 were shot on 35mm. Today, cameras from companies like Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Canon offer a variety of choices for shooting high-definition video. At the high end of the market, there has been an emergence of cameras aimed specifically at the digital cinema market. These cameras from Sony, Vision Research, Arri, Blackmagic Design, Panavision, Grass Valley and Red offer resolution and dynamic range that exceeds that of traditional video cameras, which are designed for the limited needs of broadcast television.
===Coding===
In the 1970s, pulse-code modulation (PCM) induced the birth of digital video coding, demanding high bit rates of 45-140 Mbit/s for standard-definition (SD) content. By the 1980s, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) became the standard for digital video compression.

The first digital video coding standard was H.120, created by the (International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee) or CCITT (now ITU-T) in 1984. H.120 was not practical due to weak performance. H.120 was based on differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), a compression algorithm that was inefficient for video coding. During the late 1980s, a number of companies began experimenting with DCT, a much more efficient form of compression for video coding. The CCITT received 14 proposals for DCT-based video compression formats, in contrast to a single proposal based on vector quantization (VQ) compression. The H.261 standard was developed based on DCT compression, becoming first practical video coding standard. Since H.261, DCT compression has been adopted by all the major video coding standards that followed.

MPEG-1, developed by the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG), followed in 1991, and it was designed to compress VHS-quality video. It was succeeded in 1994 by MPEG-2/H.262, which became the standard video format for DVD and SD digital television. It was followed by MPEG-4 in 1999, and then in 2003 it was followed by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which has become the most widely used video coding standard.

The current-generation video coding format is HEVC (H.265), introduced in 2013. While AVC uses the integer DCT with 4x4 and 8x8 block sizes, HEVC uses integer DCT and DST transforms with varied block sizes between 4x4 and 32x32. HEVC is heavily patented, with the majority of patents belonging to Samsung Electronics, GE, NTT and JVC Kenwood. It is currently being challenged by the aiming-to-be-freely-licensed AV1 format. , AVC is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video developers, followed by HEVC which is used by 43% of developers.

===Production===
Starting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, video production equipment that was digital in its internal workings was introduced. These included time base correctors (TBC) and digital video effects (DVE) units. They operated by taking a standard analog composite video input and digitizing it internally. This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.

Later on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as Bosch (through their Fernseh division) and Ampex developed prototype digital videotape recorders (VTR) in their research and development labs. Bosch&#x27;s machine used a modified 1-inch type B videotape transport and recorded an early form of CCIR 601 digital video. Ampex&#x27;s prototype digital video recorder used a modified 2-inch quadruplex videotape VTR (an Ampex AVR-3) fitted with custom digital video electronics and a special &quot;octaplex&quot; 8-head headwheel (regular analog 2&quot; quad machines only used 4 heads). Like standard 2&quot; quad, the audio on the Ampex prototype digital machine, nicknamed &quot;Annie&quot; by its developers, still recorded the audio in analog as linear tracks on the tape. None of these machines from these manufacturers were ever marketed commercially.

Digital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form. Component video connections required 3 cables, but most television facilities were wired for composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable. Due to this incompatibility the cost of the recorder, D1 was used primarily by large television networks and other component-video capable video studios.

In 1988, Sony and Ampex co-developed and released the D2 digital videocassette format, which recorded video digitally without compression in ITU-601 format, much like D1. In comparison, D2 had the major difference of encoding the video in composite form to the NTSC standard, thereby only requiring single-cable composite video connections to and from a D2 VCR. This made it a perfect fit for the majority of television facilities at the time. D2 was a successful format in the television broadcast industry throughout the late &#x27;80s and the &#x27;90s. D2 was also widely used in that era as the master tape format for mastering laserdiscs.

D1 &amp; D2 would eventually be replaced by cheaper systems using video compression, most notably Sony&#x27;s Digital Betacam, that were introduced into the network&#x27;s television studios. Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex&#x27;s DCT (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard DV and MiniDV and its professional variations, Sony&#x27;s DVCAM and Panasonic&#x27;s DVCPRO, and Betacam SX, a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using MPEG-2 compression.

One of the first digital video products to run on personal computers was &quot;PACo: The PICS Animation Compiler&quot; from The Company of Science &amp; Art in Providence, RI. It was developed starting in 1990 and first shipped in May 1991. PACo could stream unlimited-length video with synchronized sound from a single file (with the &quot;.CAV&quot; file extension) on CD-ROM. Creation required a Mac, and playback was possible on Macs, PCs, and Sun SPARCstations.

QuickTime, Apple Computer&#x27;s multimedia framework, was released in June 1991. Audio Video Interleave from Microsoft followed in 1992. Initial consumer-level content creation tools were crude, requiring an analog video source to be digitized to a computer-readable format. While low-quality at first, consumer digital video increased rapidly in quality, first with the introduction of playback standards such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (adopted for use in television transmission and DVD media), and the introduction of the DV tape format allowing recordings in the format to be transferred directly to digital video files using a FireWire port on an editing computer. This simplified the process, allowing non-linear editing systems (NLE) to be deployed cheaply and widely on desktop computers with no external playback or recording equipment needed.

The widespread adoption of digital video and accompanying compression formats has reduced the bandwidth needed for a high-definition video signal (with HDV and AVCHD, as well as several professional formats such as XDCAM, all using less bandwidth than a standard definition analog signal). These savings have increased the number of channels available on cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems, created opportunities for spectrum reallocation of terrestrial television broadcast frequencies, and made tapeless camcorders based on flash memory possible, among other innovations and efficiencies.

=== Culture ===
Culturally, digital video has allowed video and film to become widely available and popular, beneficial to entertainment, education, and research. Digital video is increasingly common in schools, with students and teachers taking an interest in learning how to use it in relevant ways. Digital video also has healthcare applications, allowing doctors to track infant heart rates and oxygen levels.

In addition, the switch from analog to digital video impacted media in various ways, such as in how businesses use cameras for surveillance. Closed circuit television (CCTV) switched to using digital video recorders (DVR), presenting the issue of how to store recordings for evidence collection. Today, digital video is able to be compressed in order to save storage space.

=== Digital television ===
Digital television (DTV) is the production and transmission of digital video from networks to consumers. This technique uses digital encoding instead of analog signals used prior to the 1950s. As compared to analog methods, DTV is faster and provides more capabilities and options for data to be transmitted and shared.

Digital television&#x27;s roots are tied to the availability of inexpensive, high-performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility. Digital television was previously not practically feasible due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video, requiring around 200Mbit/s for a standard-definition television (SDTV) signal, and over 1Gbit/s for high-definition television (HDTV).

==Overview ==
Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession. In the context of video, these images are called frames. The rate at which frames are displayed is known as the frame rate and is measured in frames per second. Every frame is a digital image and so comprises a formation of pixels. The color of a pixel is represented by a fixed number of bits of that color where the information of the color is stored within the image. For example, 8-bit captures 256 levels per channel, and 10-bit captures 1,024 levels per channel. The more bits, the more subtle variations of colors can be reproduced. This is called the color depth, or bit depth, of the video.

===Interlacing===
In interlaced video each &quot;frame&quot; is composed of two halves of an image. The first half contains only the odd-numbered lines of a full frame. The second half contains only the even-numbered lines. These halves are referred to individually as &quot;fields&quot;. Two consecutive fields compose a full frame. If an interlaced video has a frame rate of 30 frames per second the field rate is 60 fields per second, though both part of interlaced video, frames per second and fields per second are separate numbers.
===Bit rate and BPP===
By definition, bit rate is a measurement of the rate of information content from the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, bit rate corresponds directly to the quality of the video because bit rate is proportional to every property that affects the video quality. Bit rate is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that bit rate. Bit rate is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the bit rate and the duration. Video compression is used to greatly reduce the bit rate while having little effect on quality.

Bits per pixel (BPP) is a measure of the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. Chroma subsampling can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying JPEG compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4 allows for fractional BPP values to exist.

====Constant bit rate versus variable bit rate====
BPP represents the &quot;average&quot; bits per pixel. There are compression algorithms that keep the BPP almost constant throughout the entire duration of the video. In this case, we also get video output with a constant bitrate (CBR). This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). Since not all frames can be compressed at the same level, because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity, some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep the BPP high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way, it provides the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size, accordingly). This method produces a variable bitrate because it tracks the variations of the BPP.

==Technical overview==
Standard film stocks typically record at 24 frames per second. For video, there are two frame rate standards: NTSC, at 30/1.001 (about 29.97) frames per second (about 59.94 fields per second), and PAL, 25 frames per second (50 fields per second). Digital video cameras come in two different image capture formats: interlaced and progressive scan. Interlaced cameras record the image in alternating sets of lines: the odd-numbered lines are scanned, and then the even-numbered lines are scanned, then the odd-numbered lines are scanned again, and so on.

One set of odd or even lines is referred to as a &quot;field&quot;, and a consecutive pairing of two fields of opposite parity is called a &quot;frame&quot;. Progressive scan cameras record all lines in each frame as a single unit. Thus, interlaced video captures the scene motion twice as often as progressive video does for the same frame rate. Progressive scan generally produces a slightly sharper image, however, motion may not be as smooth as interlaced video.

Digital video can be copied with no generation loss; which degrades quality in analog systems. However, a change in parameters like frame size, or a change of the digital format can decrease the quality of the video due to image scaling and transcoding losses. Digital video can be manipulated and edited on non-linear editing systems.

Digital video has a significantly lower cost than 35 mm film. In comparison to the high cost of film stock, the digital media used for digital video recording, such as flash memory or hard disk drive is very inexpensive. Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive and time-consuming chemical processing required by film. Network transfer of digital video makes physical deliveries of tapes and film reels unnecessary. 
Digital television (including higher quality HDTV) was introduced in most developed countries in early 2000s. Today, digital video is used in modern mobile phones and video conferencing systems. Digital video is used for Internet distribution of media, including streaming video and peer-to-peer movie distribution.

Many types of video compression exist for serving digital video over the internet and on optical disks. The file sizes of digital video used for professional editing are generally not practical for these purposes, and the video requires further compression with codecs to be used for recreational purposes.

, the highest image resolution demonstrated for digital video generation is 132.7 megapixels (15360 x 8640 pixels). The highest speed is attained in industrial and scientific high-speed cameras that are capable of filming 1024x1024 video at up to 1 million frames per second for brief periods of recording.

== Technical properties ==
Live digital video consumes bandwidth. Recorded digital video consumes data storage. The amount of bandwidth or storage required is determined by the frame size, color depth and frame rate. Each pixel consumes a number of bits determined by the color depth. The data required to represent a frame of data is determined by multiplying by the number of pixels in the image. The bandwidth is determined by multiplying the storage requirement for a frame by the frame rate. The overall storage requirements for a program can then be determined by multiplying bandwidth by the duration of the program.

These calculations are accurate for uncompressed video, but due to the relatively high bit rate of uncompressed video, video compression is extensively used. In the case of compressed video, each frame requires only a small percentage of the original bits. This reduces the data or bandwidth consumption by a factor of 5 to 12 times when using lossless compression, but more commonly, lossy compression is used due to its reduction of data consumption by factors of 20 to 200. Note that it is not necessary that all frames are equally compressed by the same percentage. Instead, consider the &quot;average&quot; factor of compression for &quot;all&quot; the frames taken together.

<doc id="8735" wikidata="Q41540" url="?curid=8735" title="BIND">
<text>BIND () is a suite of software for interacting with the Domain Name System (DNS). Its most prominent component, named (pronounced &quot;name-dee&quot;: , short for &quot;name daemon&quot;), performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for DNS zones and as a recursive resolver in the network. As of 2015, it is the most widely used domain name server software, and is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard on Unix-like operating systems. Also contained in the suite are various administration tools such as nsupdate and dig, and a DNS resolver interface library.

The software was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of &quot;Berkeley Internet Name Domain&quot;, reflecting the application&#x27;s use within UC Berkeley. The current version is BIND 9, first released in 2000 and still actively maintained by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) with new releases issued several times a year.

==Key features==
BIND 9 is intended to be fully compliant with the IETF DNS standards and draft standards. Important features of BIND 9 include: TSIG, nsupdate, IPv6, RNDC (remote name daemon control), views, multiprocessor support, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), DNSSEC, and broad portability. RNDC enables remote configuration updates, using a shared secret to provide encryption for local and remote terminals during each session.

==Database support==
While earlier versions of BIND offered no mechanism to store and retrieve zone data in anything other than flat text files, in 2007 BIND 9.4 DLZ provided a compile-time option for zone storage in a variety of database formats including LDAP, Berkeley DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ODBC.

BIND 10 planned to make the data store modular, so that a variety of databases may be connected.
In 2016 ISC added support for the &#x27;dyndb&#x27; interface, contributed by RedHat, with BIND version 9.11.0.

==Security==
Security issues that are discovered in BIND 9 are patched and publicly disclosed in keeping with common principles of open source software. A complete list of security defects that have been discovered and disclosed in BIND9 is maintained by Internet Systems Consortium, the current authors of the software.

The BIND 4 and BIND 8 releases both had serious security vulnerabilities. Use of these ancient versions, or any un-maintained, non-supported version is strongly discouraged. BIND 9 was a complete rewrite, in part to mitigate these ongoing security issues. The downloads page on the ISC web site clearly shows which versions are currently maintained and which are end of life.

==History==
BIND was originally written by four graduate students at the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou, in the early 1980s as a result of a DARPA grant. The acronym &quot;BIND&quot; is for &quot;Berkeley Internet Name Domain&quot;, from a technical paper published in 1984. It was first released with Berkeley Software Distribution 4.3BSD.

Versions of BIND through 4.8.3 were maintained by the CSRG.

Paul Vixie of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) took over BIND development in 1988, releasing versions 4.9 and 4.9.1. Vixie continued to work on BIND after leaving DEC. BIND Version 4.9.2 was sponsored by Vixie Enterprises. Vixie eventually founded the Internet Software Consortium (ISC), which became the entity responsible for BIND versions starting with 4.9.3.

BIND 8 was released by ISC in May 1997.

Version 9 was developed by Nominum, Inc. under an ISC outsourcing contract, and the first version was released 9 October 2000. It was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with auditing the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). The development of BIND 9 took place under a combination of commercial and military contracts. Most of the features of BIND 9 were funded by UNIX vendors who wanted to ensure that BIND stayed competitive with Microsoft&#x27;s DNS offerings; the DNSSEC features were funded by the US military, which regarded DNS security as important. BIND 9 was released in September 2000.

In 2009, ISC started an effort to develop a new version of the software suite, initially called BIND10. In addition to DNS service, the BIND10 suite also included IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP server components. In April 2014, with BIND10 release 1.2.0 the ISC concluded its involvement in the project and renamed it to &quot;Bundy&quot;, moving the source code repository to GitHub for further development by outside public efforts. ISC discontinued its involvement in the project due to cost-cutting measures. The development of DHCP components was split off to become a new Kea project.

<doc id="8736" wikidata="Q286413" url="?curid=8736" title="Djbdns">
<text>The djbdns software package is a DNS implementation. It was created by Daniel J. Bernstein in response to his frustrations with repeated security holes in the widely used BIND DNS software. As a challenge, Bernstein offered a $1000 prize for the first person to find a security hole in djbdns, which was awarded in March 2009 to Matthew Dempsky.

, djbdns&#x27;s tinydns component was the second most popular DNS server in terms of the number of domains for which it was the authoritative server, and third most popular in terms of the number of DNS hosts running it.

djbdns has never been vulnerable to the widespread cache poisoning vulnerability reported in July 2008, but it has been discovered that it is vulnerable to a related attack.

The source code has not been centrally managed since its release in 2001, and was released into the public domain in 2007. As of March 2009, there are a number of forks, one of which is dbndns (part of the Debian Project), and more than a dozen patches to modify the released version.

While djbdns does not directly support DNSSEC, there are third party patches to add DNSSEC support to djbdns&#x27; authoritative-only tinydns component.

==Components==
The djbdns software consists of servers, clients, and miscellaneous configuration tools.

===Servers===
* dnscache — the DNS resolver and cache.
* tinydns — a database-driven DNS server.
* walldns — a &quot;reverse DNS wall&quot;, providing IP address-to-domain name lookup only.
* rbldns — a server designed for DNS blacklisting service.
* pickdns — a database-driven server that chooses from matching records depending on the requestor&#x27;s location. (This feature is now a standard part of tinydns.)
* axfrdns — a zone transfer server.

===Client tools===
* axfr-get — a zone-transfer client.
* dnsip — simple address from name lookup.
* dnsipq — address from name lookup with rewriting rules.
* dnsname — simple name from address lookup.
* dnstxt — simple text record from name lookup.
* dnsmx — mail exchanger lookup.
* dnsfilter — looks up names for addresses read from stdin, in parallel.
* dnsqr — recursive general record lookup.
* dnsq — non-recursive general record lookup, useful for debugging.
* dnstrace (and dnstracesort) — comprehensive testing of the chains of authority over DNS servers and their names.

==Design==
In djbdns, different features and services are split off into separate programs. For example, zone transfers, zone file parsing, caching, and recursive resolving are implemented as separate programs. The result of these design decisions is a reduction in code size and complexity of the daemon program that provides the core function of answering lookup requests. Bernstein asserts that this is true to the spirit of the Unix operating system, and makes security verification much simpler.

==Copyright status==
On December 28, 2007, Bernstein released djbdns into the public domain. Previously the package was distributed free of charge as license-free software. However this did not permit the distribution of modified versions of djbdns, which was one of the core principles of open-source software. Consequently, it was not included in those Linux distributions which required all components to be open-source.

<doc id="8741" wikidata="Q1268744" url="?curid=8741" title="Dylan (programming language)">
<text>Dylan is a multi-paradigm programming language that includes support for functional and object-oriented programming (OOP), and is dynamic and reflective while providing a programming model designed to support generating efficient machine code, including fine-grained control over dynamic and static behaviors. It was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer.

Dylan derives from Scheme and Common Lisp and adds an integrated object system derived from the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). In Dylan, all values (including numbers, characters, functions, and classes) are first-class objects. Dylan supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object introspection, pattern-based syntax extension macros, and many other advanced features. Programs can express fine-grained control over dynamism, admitting programs that occupy a continuum between dynamic and static programming and supporting evolutionary development (allowing for rapid prototyping followed by incremental refinement and optimization).

Dylan&#x27;s main design goal is to be a dynamic language well-suited for developing commercial software. Dylan attempts to address potential performance issues by introducing &quot;natural&quot; limits to the full flexibility of Lisp systems, allowing the compiler to clearly understand compilable units, such as libraries.

Dylan derives much of its semantics from Scheme and other Lisps; some Dylan implementations were initially built within extant Lisp systems. However, Dylan has an ALGOL-like syntax instead of a Lisp-like prefix syntax.

==History==
Dylan was created in the early 1990s by a group led by Apple Computer. At one time in its development, it was intended for use with the Apple Newton computer, but the Dylan implementation did not reach sufficient maturity in time, and Newton instead used a mix of C and the NewtonScript developed by Walter Smith. Apple ended their Dylan development effort in 1995, though they made a &quot;technology release&quot; version available (Apple Dylan TR1) that included an advanced integrated development environment (IDE).

Two other groups contributed to the design of the language and developed implementations: Harlequin released a commercial IDE for Microsoft Windows and Carnegie Mellon University released an open source compiler for Unix systems called Gwydion Dylan. Both of these implementations are now open source. The Harlequin implementation is now named Open Dylan and is maintained by a group of volunteers, the Dylan Hackers.

The Dylan language was code-named Ralph. James Joaquin chose the name Dylan for &quot;DYnamic LANguage.&quot;

==Syntax==
Many of Dylan&#x27;s syntax features come from its Lisp heritage. Originally, Dylan used a Lisp-like prefix syntax, which was based on s-expressions. By the time the language design was completed, the syntax was changed to an ALGOL-like syntax, with the expectation that it would be more familiar to a wider audience of programmers. The syntax was designed by Michael Kahl. It is described in great detail in the Dylan Reference Manual.

===Lexical syntax===
Dylan is not case sensitive. Dylan&#x27;s lexical syntax allows the use of a naming convention where hyphen (minus) signs are used to connect the parts of multiple-word identifiers (sometimes called &quot;lisp-case&quot; or &quot;kebab case&quot;). This convention is common in Lisp languages.

Besides alphanumeric characters and hyphen-minus signs, Dylan allows a variety of non-alphanumeric characters as part of identifiers. Identifiers may not consist of these non-alphanumeric characters alone. If there is any ambiguity, whitespace is used.

===Example code===
A simple class with several slots:
define class &lt;point&gt; (&lt;object&gt;)
 slot point-x :: &lt;integer&gt;,
 required-init-keyword: x:;
 slot point-y :: &lt;integer&gt;,
 required-init-keyword: y:;
end class &lt;point&gt;;
By convention, classes are named with less-than and greater-than signs used as angle brackets, e.g. the class named codice_1 in the code example.

In codice_2 both codice_3 and codice_1 are optional. This is true for all codice_5 clauses. For example, you may write codice_6 or just codice_5 to terminate an codice_8 statement.

To make an instance of codice_1:
make(&lt;point&gt;, x: 100, y: 200)

The same class, rewritten in the most minimal way possible:
define class &lt;point&gt; (&lt;object&gt;)
 slot point-x;
 slot point-y;
end;
The slots are now both typed as codice_10. The slots must be initialized manually:
let p = make(&lt;point&gt;);
point-x(p) := 100; // or p.point-x := 100;
point-y(p) := 200; // or p.point-y := 200;
By convention, constant names begin with &quot;$&quot;:
define constant $pi :: &lt;double-float&gt; = 3.1415927d0;
A factorial function:

define function factorial (n :: &lt;integer&gt;) =&gt; (n! :: &lt;integer&gt;)
 case
 n &lt; 0 =&gt; error(&quot;Can&#x27;t take factorial of negative integer: %d\n&quot;, n);
 n = 0 =&gt; 1;
 otherwise =&gt; n * factorial(n - 1);
 end
end;
Here, codice_11 and codice_12 are just normal identifiers.

There is no explicit return statement. The result of a method or function is the last expression evaluated. It is a common style to leave off the semicolon after an expression in return position.

==Modules vs. namespace==
In many object-oriented languages, classes are the main means of encapsulation and modularity; each class defines a namespace and controls which definitions are externally visible. Further, classes in many languages define an indivisible unit that must be used as a whole. For example, using a codice_13 concatenation function requires importing and compiling against all of codice_13.

Some languages, including Dylan, also include a separate, explicit namespace or module system that performs encapsulation in a more general way.

In Dylan, the concepts of compile-unit and import-unit are separated, and classes have nothing specifically to do with either. A &quot;library&quot; defines items that should be compiled and handled together, while a &quot;module&quot; defines a namespace. Classes can be placed together in modules, or cut across them, as the programmer wishes. Often the complete definition for a class does not exist in a single module, but is spread across several that are optionally collected together. Different programs can have different definitions of the same class, including only what they need.

For example, consider an add-on library for regex support on codice_13. In some languages, for the functionality to be included in strings, the functionality must be added to the codice_13 namespace. As soon as this occurs, the codice_13 class becomes larger, and functions that don&#x27;t need to use regex still must &quot;pay&quot; for it in increased library size. For this reason, these sorts of add-ons are typically placed in their own namespaces and objects. The downside to this approach is that the new functions are no longer a &quot;part of&quot; codice_13; instead, it is isolated in its own set of functions that must be called separately. Instead of codice_19, which would be the natural organization from an OO viewpoint, something like codice_20 is used, which effectively reverses the ordering.

Under Dylan, many interfaces can be defined for the same code, for instance the String concatenation method could be placed in both the String interface, and the &quot;concat&quot; interface which collects together all of the different concatenation functions from various classes. This is more commonly used in math libraries, where functions tend to be applicable to widely differing object types.

A more practical use of the interface construct is to build public and private versions of a module, something that other languages include as a &quot;bolt on&quot; feature that invariably causes problems and adds syntax. Under Dylan, every function call can be simply placed in the &quot;Private&quot; or &quot;Development&quot; interface, and collect up publicly accessible functions in codice_21. Under Java or C++ the visibility of an object is defined in the code, meaning that to support a similar change, a programmer would be forced to rewrite the definitions fully, and could not have two versions at the same time.

==Classes==
Classes in Dylan describe codice_22 (data members, fields, ivars, etc.) of objects in a fashion similar to most OO languages. All access to slots is via methods, as in Smalltalk. Default getter and setter methods are automatically generated based on the slot names. In contrast with most other OO languages, other methods applicable to the class are often defined outside of the class, and thus class definitions in Dylan typically include the definition of the storage only. For instance:
define class &lt;window&gt; (&lt;view&gt;)
 slot title :: &lt;string&gt; = &quot;untitled&quot;, init-keyword: title:;
 slot position :: &lt;point&gt;, required-init-keyword: position:;
end class;
In this example, the class &quot;codice_23&quot; is defined. The &lt;class name&gt; syntax is convention only, to make the class names stand out—the angle brackets are merely part of the class name. In contrast, in some languages the convention is to capitalize the first letter of the class name or to prefix the name with a &quot;C&quot; or &quot;T&quot; (for example). codice_23 inherits from a single class, codice_25, and contains two slots, codice_26 holding a string for the window title, and codice_27 holding an X-Y point for a corner of the window. In this example, the title has been given a default value, while the position has not. The optional &quot;init-keyword&quot; syntax allows the programmer to specify the initial value of the slot when instantiating an object of the class.

In languages such as C++ or Java, the class would also define its interface. In this case the definition above has no explicit instructions, so in both languages access to the slots and methods is considered codice_28, meaning they can be used only by subclasses. To allow unrelated code to use the window instances, they must be declared codice_29.

In Dylan, these sorts of visibility rules are not considered part of the code, but of the module/interface system. This adds considerable flexibility. For instance, one interface used during early development could declare everything public, whereas one used in testing and deployment could limit this. With C++ or Java these changes would require changes to the source code, so people won&#x27;t do it, whereas in Dylan this is a fully unrelated concept.

Although this example does not use it, Dylan also supports multiple inheritance.

==Methods and generic functions==
In Dylan, methods are not intrinsically associated with any specific class; methods can be thought of as existing outside of classes. Like CLOS, Dylan is based on multiple dispatch (multimethods), where the specific method to be called is chosen based on the types of all its arguments. The method need not be known at compile time, the understanding being that the required function may be available, or not, based on a user&#x27;s preferences.

Under Java the same methods would be isolated in a specific class. To use that functionality the programmer is forced to &quot;import&quot; that class and refer to it explicitly to call the method. If that class is unavailable, or unknown at compile time, the application simply won&#x27;t compile.

In Dylan, code is isolated from storage in &quot;functions&quot;. Many classes have methods that call their own functions, thereby looking and feeling like most other OO languages. However code may also be located in &quot;generic functions&quot;, meaning they are not attached to a specific class, and can be called natively by anyone. Linking a specific generic function to a method in a class is accomplished thusly:
define method turn-blue (w :: &lt;window&gt;)
 w.color := $blue;
end method;
This definition is similar to those in other languages, and would likely be encapsulated within the codice_23 class. Note the := setter call, which is syntactic sugar for codice_31.

The utility of generic methods comes into its own when you consider more &quot;generic&quot; examples. For instance, one common function in most languages is the codice_32, which returns some human-readable form for the object. For instance, a window might return its title and its position in parens, while a string would return itself. In Dylan these methods could all be collected into a single module called &quot;codice_32&quot;, thereby removing this code from the definition of the class itself. If a specific object did not support a codice_32, it could be easily added in the codice_32 module.

==Extensibility==
This whole concept might strike some readers as very odd. The code to handle codice_32 for a window isn&#x27;t defined in codice_23? This might not make any sense until you consider how Dylan handles the call of the codice_32. In most languages when the program is compiled the codice_32 for codice_23 is looked up and replaced with a pointer (more or less) to the method. In Dylan this occurs when the program is first run; the runtime builds a table of method-name/parameters details and looks up methods dynamically via this table. That means that a function for a specific method can be located anywhere, not just in the compile-time unit. In the end the programmer is given considerable flexibility in terms of where to place their code, collecting it along class lines where appropriate, and functional lines where it&#x27;s not.

The implication here is that a programmer can add functionality to existing classes by defining functions in a separate file. For instance, you might wish to add spell checking to all codice_41s, which in C++ or Java would require access to the source code of the string class—and such basic classes are rarely given out in source form. In Dylan (and other &quot;extensible languages&quot;) the spell checking method could be added in the codice_42 module, defining all of the classes on which it can be applied via the codice_43 construct. In this case the actual functionality might be defined in a single generic function, which takes a string and returns the errors. When the codice_42 module is compiled into your program, all strings (and other objects) will get the added functionality.

<text>The Dublin Core vocabulary, also known as the Dublin Core Metadata Terms (DCMT), is a general purpose metadata vocabulary for describing resources of any type. It was first developed for describing web content in the early days of the World Wide Web. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is responsible for maintaining the Dublin 
Core vocabulary.

Initially developed as fifteen terms in 1998 the set of elements has grown over time and in 2008 was redefined as an Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary.

Designed with minimal constraints, each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements.

==Milestones==
* 1995 - In 1995 an invitational meeting hosted by the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) takes place at Dublin, Ohio, the headquarters of OCLC.
* 1998, September - RFC 2413 &quot;Dublin Core Metadata for Resource Discovery&quot; details the original 15-element vocabulary.
* 2000 - Issuance of Qualified Dublin Core.
* 2001 - Publication of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set as ANSI/NISO Z39.85.
* 2008 - Publication of Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Terms in RDF.

==Evolution of the Dublin Core vocabulary==
The Dublin Core Element Set was a response to concern about accurate finding of resources on the Web, with some early assumptions that this would be a library function. In particular it anticipated a future in which scholarly materials would be searchable on the World Wide Web. Whereas HTML was being used to mark-up the structure of documents, metadata was needed to mark-up the contents of documents. Given the great number of documents on, and soon to be on, the World Wide Web, it was proposed that &quot;self-identifying&quot; documents would be necessary.

To this end, the Dublin Core Metadata Workshop met beginning in 1995 to develop a vocabulary that could be used to insert consistent metadata into Web documents. Originally defined as 15 metadata elements, the Dublin Core Element Set allowed authors of web pages a vocabulary and method for creating simple metadata for their works. It provided a simple, flat element set that could be used

Qualified Dublin Core was developed in the late 1990s to provide an extension mechanism to the vocabulary of 15 elements. This was a response to communities whose metadata needs required additional detail.

In 2012, the &quot;DCMI Metadata Terms&quot; was created using a RDF data model. This expanded element set incorporates the original 15 elements and many of the qualifiers of the qualified Dublin Core as RDF properties. The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. There is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.

=== Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, 1995===

The Dublin Core vocabulary published in 1999 consisted of 15 terms:

The vocabulary was commonly expressed in HTML &#x27;meta&#x27; tagging in the &quot;&lt;head&gt;&quot; section of an HTML-encoded page. 
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta name=&quot;DC.title&quot; content=&quot;Services to Government&quot; &gt;
 &lt;meta name=&quot;DC.date&quot; content=&quot;1997-07&quot; &gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
The vocabulary could be used in any metadata serialization including key/value pairs and XML.

===Qualified Dublin Core, 2000===

Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, Qualified Dublin Core was developed to provide an extension mechanism to be used when the primary 15 terms were not sufficient. A set of common refinements was provided in the documentation. These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. Qualified Dublin Core was not limited to these specific refinements, allowing communities to create extended metadata terms to meet their needs.

The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the &quot;Dumb-Down Principle&quot;, states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.

Qualified Dublin Core added qualifiers to these elements:

And added three elements not in the base 15:
* Audience
* Provenance
* RightsHolder

Qualified Dublin Core is often used with a &quot;dot syntax&quot;, with a period separating the element and the qualifier(s). This is shown in this excerpted example provided by Chan and Hodges:

===DCMI Metadata Terms, 2008===

The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary. This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in &quot;italic&quot;), as well as many of the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as RDF properties.

It also includes these RDF classes which are used as domains and ranges of some properties:

==Maintenance of the standard==

Changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy. This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.

==Dublin Core as standards==

The Dublin Core Metadata Terms vocabulary has been formally standardized internationally as ISO 15836 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and as IETF RFC 5013 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
as well as in the U.S. as ANSI/NISO Z39.85 by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO).

==Syntax==
Syntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and apply to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both machines and people.

==Notable applications==
One Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification. OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server.

PBCore is also based on Dublin Core. The Zope CMF&#x27;s Metadata products, used by the Plone, ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file. Qualified Dublin Core is used in the DSpace archival management software.

The Australian Government Locator Service (AGLS) metadata standard is an application profile of Dublin Core.

<text>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers (also known as event listeners) attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

In HTML DOM (Document Object Model), every element is a node:

* A document is a document node.
* All HTML elements are element nodes.
* All HTML attributes are attribute nodes.
* Text inserted into HTML elements are text nodes.
* Comments are comment nodes.

==History==
The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the &quot;browser wars&quot; of the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as with that of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the JavaScript engines of web browsers.

JavaScript was released by Netscape Communications in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0. Netscape&#x27;s competitor, Microsoft, released Internet Explorer 3.0 the following year with a reimplementation of JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let web developers create web pages with client-side interactivity. The limited facilities for detecting user-generated events and modifying the HTML document in the first generation of these languages eventually became known as &quot;DOM Level 0&quot; or &quot;Legacy DOM.&quot; No independent standard was developed for DOM Level 0, but it was partly described in the specifications for HTML 4.

Legacy DOM was limited in the kinds of elements that could be accessed. Form, link and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a form input element could be accessed as either codice_1 or codice_2.

The Legacy DOM enabled client-side form validation and simple interface interactivity like creating tooltips.

In 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer respectively, adding support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded HTML document. DHTML required extensions to the rudimentary document object that was available in the Legacy DOM implementations. Although the Legacy DOM implementations were largely compatible since JScript was based on JavaScript, the DHTML DOM extensions were developed in parallel by each browser maker and remained incompatible. These versions of the DOM became known as the &quot;Intermediate DOM&quot;.

After the standardization of ECMAScript, the W3C DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM specification. The completed specification, known as &quot;DOM Level 1&quot;, became a W3C Recommendation in late 1998. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Internet Explorer 6 (from 2001), Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).

==Standards==

The W3C DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. Development efforts migrated to the WHATWG, which continues to maintain a living standard. In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C. In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of HTML5, the DOM Level 4 specification was reassigned to the HTML Working Group to expedite its completion. Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web Platform group. Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

* DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.
* DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the codice_3 function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.
* DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.
* HTML5 was published in October 2014. Part of HTML5 had replaced DOM Level 2 HTML module.
* DOM Level 4 was published in 2015 and retired in November 2020.
* DOM 2020-06 was published in September 2021 as a W3C Recommendation. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.

==Applications==
===Web browsers===
To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the &quot;DOM tree&quot;, with the topmost node named as &quot;Document object&quot;. When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen. However, the DOM does not necessarily need to be represented as a tree, and some browsers have used other internal models.

===JavaScript===
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic web pages, because within a page JavaScript can:

* add, change, and remove any of the HTML elements and attributes
* change any of the CSS styles
* react to all the existing events
* create new events

== DOM tree structure ==
A Document Object Model (DOM) tree is a hierarchical representation of an HTML or XML document. It consists of a root node, which is the document itself, and a series of child nodes that represent the elements, attributes, and text content of the document. Each node in the tree has a parent node, except for the root node, and can have multiple child nodes.

=== Elements as nodes ===
Elements in an HTML or XML document are represented as nodes in the DOM tree. Each element node has a tag name and attributes, and can contain other element nodes or text nodes as children. For example, an HTML document with the following structure:
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to DOM&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is my website.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
will be represented in the DOM tree as:
- Document (root)
 - html
 - head
 - title
 - &quot;My Website&quot;
 - body
 - h1
 - &quot;Welcome&quot;
 - p
 - &quot;This is my website.&quot;

=== Text nodes ===
Text content within an element is represented as a text node in the DOM tree. Text nodes do not have attributes or child nodes, and are always leaf nodes in the tree. For example, the text content &quot;My Website&quot; in the title element and &quot;Welcome&quot; in the h1 element in the above example are both represented as text nodes.

=== Attributes as properties ===
Attributes of an element are represented as properties of the element node in the DOM tree. For example, an element with the following HTML:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
will be represented in the DOM tree as:
- a
 - href: &quot;https://example.com&quot;
 - &quot;Link&quot;

== Manipulating the DOM tree ==
The DOM tree can be manipulated using JavaScript or other programming languages. Common tasks include navigating the tree, adding, removing, and modifying nodes, and getting and setting the properties of nodes. The DOM API provides a set of methods and properties to perform these operations, such as codice_3, codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7.
// Create the root element
var root = document.createElement(&quot;root&quot;);

// Create a child element
var child = document.createElement(&quot;child&quot;);

// Add the child element to the root element
root.appendChild(child);

Another way to create a DOM structure is using the innerHTML property to insert HTML code as a string, creating the elements and children in the process. For example:
document.getElementById(&quot;root&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;&lt;child&gt;&lt;/child&gt;&quot;;
Another method is to use a JavaScript library or framework such as jQuery, AngularJS, React, Vue.js, etc. These libraries provide a more convenient, eloquent and efficient way to create, manipulate and interact with the DOM.

It is also possible to create a DOM structure from an XML or JSON data, using JavaScript methods to parse the data and create the nodes accordingly.

Creating a DOM structure does not necessarily mean that it will be displayed in the web page, it only exists in memory and should be appended to the document body or a specific container to be rendered.

In summary, creating a DOM structure involves creating individual nodes and organizing them in a hierarchical structure using JavaScript or other programming languages, and it can be done using several methods depending on the use case and the developer&#x27;s preference.

==Implementations==
Because the DOM supports navigation in any direction (e.g., parent and previous sibling) and allows for arbitrary modifications, implementations typically buffer the document. However, a DOM need not originate in a serialized document at all, but can be created in place with the DOM API. And even before the idea of the DOM originated, there were implementations of equivalent structure with persistent disk representation and rapid access, for example DynaText&#x27;s model disclosed in and various database approaches.

===Layout engines===

Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as Trident/MSHTML, are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. Others, including Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared by a number of browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. The different layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance.

===Libraries===
DOM implementations:

* libxml2
* MSXML
* Xerces is a collection of DOM implementations written in C++, Java and Perl
* xml.dom for Python 
* XML for &lt;SCRIPT&gt; is a JavaScript-based DOM implementation
* PHP.Gt DOM is a server-side DOM implementation based on libxml2 and brings DOM level 4 compatibility to the PHP programming language
* Domino is a Server-side (Node.js) DOM implementation based on Mozilla&#x27;s dom.js. Domino is used in the MediaWiki stack with Visual Editor.
* SimpleHtmlDom is a simple HTML document object model in C#, which can generate HTML string programmatically.

APIs that expose DOM implementations:

* JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) is an API for accessing DOM providers
* Lazarus (Free Pascal IDE) contains two variants of the DOM - with UTF-8 and ANSI format

Inspection tools:

* DOM Inspector is a web developer tool

<doc id="8745" wikidata="Q5253831" url="?curid=8745" title="Design pattern">
<text>A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. The idea was introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander and has been adapted for various other disciplines, particularly software engineering.

== Details ==
An organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is called a pattern language. This language gives a common terminology for discussing the situations designers are faced with.

Documenting a pattern requires explaining why a particular situation causes problems, and how the components of the pattern relate to each other to give the solution. Christopher Alexander describes common design problems as arising from &quot;conflicting forces&quot;—such as the conflict between wanting a room to be sunny and wanting it not to overheat on summer afternoons. A pattern would not tell the designer how many windows to put in the room; instead, it would propose a set of values to guide the designer toward a decision that is best for their particular application. Alexander, for example, suggests that enough windows should be included to direct light all around the room. He considers this a good solution because he believes it increases the enjoyment of the room by its occupants. Other authors might come to different conclusions, if they place higher value on heating costs, or material costs. These values, used by the pattern&#x27;s author to determine which solution is &quot;best&quot;, must also be documented within the pattern.

Pattern documentation should also explain when it is applicable. Since two houses may be very different from one another, a design pattern for houses must be broad enough to apply to both of them, but not so vague that it doesn&#x27;t help the designer make decisions. The range of situations in which a pattern can be used is called its context. Some examples might be &quot;all houses&quot;, &quot;all two-story houses&quot;, or &quot;all places where people spend time&quot;.

For instance, in Christopher Alexander&#x27;s work, bus stops and waiting rooms in a surgery center are both within the context for the pattern &quot;A PLACE TO WAIT&quot;.

== Examples ==

* Software design pattern, in software design
* Architectural pattern, for software architecture
* Interaction design pattern, used in interaction design / human–computer interaction
* Pedagogical patterns, in teaching
* Pattern gardening, in gardening

Business models also have design patterns. See .

<doc id="8748" wikidata="Q407217" url="?curid=8748" title="N,N-Dimethyltryptamine">
<text>N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethyltryptamine(DMTor N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-DMT) is a substituted tryptamine that occurs in many plants and animals, including humans, and which is both a derivative and a structural analog of tryptamine. DMT is used as a psychedelic drug and prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen. 

DMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the &quot;businessman&#x27;s trip&quot; during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. DMT can be inhaled or injected and its effects depend on the dose, as well as the mode of administration. When inhaled or injected, the effects last about five to fifteen minutes. Effects can last three hours or more when orally ingested along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as the ayahuasca brew of many native Amazonian tribes. DMT can produce vivid &quot;projections&quot; of mystical experiences involving euphoria and dynamic pseudohallucinations of geometric forms.

DMT is a functional analog and structural analog of other psychedelic tryptamines such as &quot;O&quot;-acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT), psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), psilocin (4-HO-DMT), NB-DMT, &quot;O&quot;-methylbufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), and bufotenin (5-HO-DMT). Parts of the structure of DMT occur within some important biomolecules like serotonin and melatonin, making them structural analogs of DMT.

==Human consumption==
DMT is produced in many species of plants often in conjunction with its close chemical relatives 5-methoxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and bufotenin (5-OH-DMT). DMT-containing plants are commonly used in indigenous Amazonian shamanic practices. It is usually one of the main active constituents of the drink ayahuasca; however, ayahuasca is sometimes brewed with plants that do not produce DMT. It occurs as the primary psychoactive alkaloid in several plants including &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot;, &quot;Diplopterys cabrerana&quot;, and &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot;. DMT is found as a minor alkaloid in snuff made from &quot;Virola&quot; bark resin in which 5-MeO-DMT is the main active alkaloid. DMT is also found as a minor alkaloid in bark, pods, and beans of &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; and &quot;Anadenanthera colubrina&quot; used to make Yopo and Vilca snuff, in which bufotenin is the main active alkaloid. Psilocin and psilocybin, the main psychoactive compounds in psilocybin mushrooms, are structurally similar to DMT.

The psychotropic effects of DMT were first studied scientifically by the Hungarian chemist and psychologist Stephen Szára, who performed research with volunteers in the mid-1950s. Szára, who later worked for the United States National Institutes of Health, had turned his attention to DMT after his order for LSD from the Swiss company Sandoz Laboratories was rejected on the grounds that the powerful psychotropic could be dangerous in the hands of a communist country.

DMT is generally not active orally unless it is combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), for example, harmaline. Without a MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes orally administered DMT, and it therefore has no hallucinogenic effect unless the dose exceeds the body&#x27;s monoamine oxidase&#x27;s metabolic capacity. Other means of consumption such as vaporizing, injecting, or insufflating the drug can produce powerful hallucinations for a short time (usually less than half an hour), as the DMT reaches the brain before it can be metabolized by the body&#x27;s natural monoamine oxidase. Taking an MAOI prior to vaporizing or injecting DMT prolongs and enhances the effects.

===Clinical use research===
Existing research on clinical use of DMT mostly focuses on its effects when exogenously administered as a drug. Although the scientific consensus is that DMT is a naturally occurring molecule in humans, the effects of endogenous DMT in humans (and more broadly in mammals) is still not well understood. 

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous ligand of sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1Rs), acts against systemic hypoxia. Research demonstrates DMT reduces the number of apoptotic and ferroptotic cells in mammalian forebrain and supports astrocyte survival in an ischemic environment. According to these data, DMT may be considered as adjuvant pharmacological therapy in the management of acute cerebral ischemia.

DMT is studied as a potential treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.

SPL026 (DMT fumarate) is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials investigating its use alongside supportive psychotherapy as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder. Additionally, a safety study is underway to investigate the effects of combining SSRIs with SPL026.

===Neuropharmacology===
Recently, researchers discovered that &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine is a potent psychoplastogen, a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity that may have wide-ranging therapeutic benefit. 

Quantities of dimethyltryptamine and &quot;O&quot;-methylbufotenin were found present in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans in a psychiatric study.

==Effects==
===Subjective psychedelic experiences===
Subjective experiences of DMT includes profound time-dilatory, visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive distortions and hallucinations, and other experiences that, by most firsthand accounts, defy verbal or visual description. Examples include perceiving hyperbolic geometry or seeing Escher-like impossible objects.

Several scientific experimental studies have tried to measure subjective experiences of altered states of consciousness induced by drugs under highly controlled and safe conditions.

Rick Strassman and his colleagues conducted a five-year-long DMT study at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s. The results provided insight about the quality of subjective psychedelic experiences. In this study participants received the DMT dosage via intravenous injection and the findings suggested that different psychedelic experiences can occur, depending on the level of dosage. Lower doses (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg) produced some aesthetic and emotional responses, but not hallucinogenic experiences (e.g., 0.05 mg/kg had mild mood elevating and calming properties). In contrast, responses produced by higher doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) researchers labeled as &quot;hallucinogenic&quot; that elicited &quot;intensely colored, rapidly moving display of visual images, formed, abstract or both&quot;. Comparing to other sensory modalities, the most affected was the visual. Participants reported visual hallucinations, fewer auditory hallucinations and specific physical sensations progressing to a sense of bodily dissociation, as well as experiences of euphoria, calm, fear, and anxiety. These dose-dependent effects match well with anonymously posted &quot;trip reports&quot; online, where users report &quot;breakthroughs&quot; above certain doses.

Strassman also highlighted the importance of the context where the drug has been taken. He claimed that DMT has no beneficial effects of itself, rather the context when and where people take it plays an important role.

It appears that DMT can induce a state or feeling wherein the person believes to &quot;communicate with other intelligent lifeforms&quot; (see &quot;machine elves&quot;). High doses of DMT produce a state that involves a sense of &quot;another intelligence&quot; that people sometimes describe as &quot;super-intelligent&quot;, but &quot;emotionally detached&quot;.

A 1995 study by Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter found that the DMT-induced altered state of consciousness (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual rather than situative factors. In the study, researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to examine ASC. The first dimension, oceanic boundlessness (OB), refers to dissolution of ego boundaries and is mostly associated with positive emotions. The second dimension, anxious ego-dissolution (AED), represents a disordering of thoughts and decreases in autonomy and self-control. Last, visionary restructuralization (VR) refers to auditory/visual illusions and hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within the first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially with DMT, and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales.

====Reported encounters with external entities====
Entities perceived during DMT inebriation have been represented in diverse forms of psychedelic art. The term &quot;machine elf&quot; was coined by ethnobotanist Terence McKenna for the entities he encountered in DMT &quot;hyperspace&quot;, also using terms like &quot;fractal elves&quot;, or &quot;self-transforming machine elves&quot;. McKenna first encountered the &quot;machine elves&quot; after smoking DMT in Berkeley in 1965. His subsequent speculations regarding the hyperdimensional space in which they were encountered have inspired a great many artists and musicians, and the meaning of DMT entities has been a subject of considerable debate among participants in a networked cultural underground, enthused by McKenna&#x27;s effusive accounts of DMT hyperspace. Cliff Pickover has also written about the &quot;machine elf&quot; experience, in the book &quot;Sex, Drugs, Einstein, &amp; Elves&quot;. Strassman noted similarities between self-reports of his DMT study participants&#x27; encounters with these &quot;entities&quot;, and mythological descriptions of figures such as Ḥayyot haq-Qodesh in ancient religions, including both angels and demons. Strassman also argues for a similarity in his study participants&#x27; descriptions of mechanized wheels, gears and machinery in these encounters, with those described in visions of encounters with the Living Creatures and Ophanim of the Hebrew Bible, noting they may stem from a common neuropsychopharmacological experience.

Strassman argues that the more positive of the &quot;external entities&quot; encountered in DMT experiences should be understood as analogous to certain forms of angels: 
Strassman&#x27;s experimental participants also note that some other entities can subjectively resemble creatures more like insects and aliens. As a result, Strassman writes these experiences among his experimental participants &quot;also left me feeling confused and concerned about where the spirit molecule was leading us. It was at this point that I began to wonder if I was getting in over my head with this research.&quot;

Hallucinations of strange creatures had been reported by Stephen Szara in a 1958 study in psychotic patients, in which he described how one of his subjects under the influence of DMT had experienced &quot;strange creatures, dwarves or something&quot; at the beginning of a DMT trip.

Other researchers of the entities seemingly encountered by DMT users describe them as &quot;entities&quot; or &quot;beings&quot; in humanoid as well as animal form, with descriptions of &quot;little people&quot; being common (non-human gnomes, elves, imps, etc.). Strassman and others have speculated that this form of hallucination may be the cause of alien abduction and extraterrestrial encounter experiences, which may occur through endogenously-occurring DMT.

Likening them to descriptions of rattling and chattering auditory phenomena described in encounters with the Hayyoth in the Book of Ezekiel, Rick Strassman notes that participants in his studies, when reporting encounters with the alleged entities, have also described loud auditory hallucinations, such as one subject reporting typically &quot;the elves laughing or talking at high volume, chattering, twittering&quot;.

====Near-death experience====
A 2018 study found significant relationships between a DMT experience and a near-death experience (NDE). A 2019 large-scale study pointed that ketamine, &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, and DMT (and other classical psychedelic substances) may be linked to near-death experiences due to the semantic similarity of reports associated with the use of psychoactive compounds and NDE narratives, but the study concluded that with the current data it is neither possible to corroborate nor refute the hypothesis that the release of an endogenous ketamine-like neuroprotective agent underlies NDE phenomenology.

===Physiological response===
According to a dose-response study in human subjects, dimethyltryptamine administered intravenously slightly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of &quot;beta&quot;-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin; growth hormone blood levels rise equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected.&quot;

===Conjecture regarding endogenous production and effects===
In the 1950s, the endogenous production of psychoactive agents was considered to be a potential explanation for the hallucinatory symptoms of some psychiatric diseases; this is known as the transmethylation hypothesis. Several speculative and yet untested hypotheses suggest that endogenous DMT is produced in the human brain and is involved in certain psychological and neurological states. DMT is naturally occurring in small amounts in rat brains, human cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues of humans and other mammals. Further, mRNA for the enzyme necessary for the production of DMT, INMT, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland, suggesting an endogenous role in the human brain. In 2011, Nicholas Cozzi of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, and three other researchers, concluded that INMT, an enzyme that is associated with the biosynthesis of DMT and endogenous hallucinogens is present in the non-human primate (rhesus macaque) pineal gland, retinal ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. Neurobiologist Andrew Gallimore (2013) suggested that while DMT might not have a modern neural function, it may have been an ancestral neuromodulator once secreted in psychedelic concentrations during REM sleep, a function now lost.

==Adverse effects==

===Acute adverse psychological reaction===
DMT may trigger psychological reactions, known colloquially as a &quot;bad trip&quot;, such as intense fear, paranoia, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance-induced psychosis, particularly in predisposed individuals.

===Addiction and dependence liability===
DMT, like other serotonergic psychedelics, is considered to be non-addictive with low abuse potential. A study examining substance use disorder for DSM-IV reported that almost no hallucinogens produced dependence, unlike psychoactive drugs of other classes such as stimulants and depressants. At present, there have been no studies that report drug withdrawal syndrome with termination of DMT, and dependence potential of DMT and the risk of sustained psychological disturbance may be minimal when used infrequently; however, the physiological dependence potential of DMT and ayahuasca has not yet been documented convincingly.

===Tolerance===
Unlike other classical psychedelics, tolerance does not seem to develop to the subjective effects of DMT. Studies report that DMT did not exhibit tolerance upon repeated administration of twice a day sessions, separated by 5hours, for 5consecutive days; field reports suggests a refractory period of only 15 to 30minutes, while the plasma levels of DMT was nearly undetectable 30minutes after intravenous administration. Another study of four closely spaced DMT infusion sessions with 30minute intervals also suggests no tolerance buildup to the psychological effects of the compound, while heart rate responses and neuroendocrine effects were diminished with repeated administration. Similarly to DMT by itself, tolerance does not appear to develop to ayahuasca. A fully hallucinogenic dose of DMT did not demonstrate cross-tolerance to human subjects who are highly tolerant to LSD; hence, research suggests that DMT exhibits unique pharmacological properties compared to other classical psychedelics.

===Long-term use===
There have been no serious adverse effects reported on long-term use of DMT, apart from acute cardiovascular events. Repeated and one-time administration of DMT produces marked changes in the cardiovascular system, with an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure; although the changes were not statistically significant, a robust trend towards significance was observed for systolic blood pressure at high doses.

===Drug-interactions===
DMT is inactive when ingested orally due to metabolism by MAO, and DMT-containing drinks such as ayahuasca have been found to contain MAOIs, in particular, harmine and harmaline. Life-threatening lethalities such as serotonin syndrome (SS) may occur when MAOIs are combined with certain serotonergic medications such as SSRI antidepressants. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported with tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, analgesic, and antimigraine drugs; it is advised to exercise caution when an individual had used dextromethorphan (DXM), MDMA, ginseng, or &quot;St. John&#x27;s wort&quot; recently.

Chronic use of SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs diminish subjective effects of psychedelics due to presumed SSRI-induced 5-HT2A receptors downregulation and MAOI-induced 5-HT2A receptor desensitization. The interaction between psychedelics and antipsychotics and anticonvulsant are not well documented, however reports reveal that co-use of psychedelics with mood stabilizers such as lithium may provoke seizure and dissociative effects in individuals with bipolar disorder.

==Routes of administration==
===Inhalation===
A standard dose for vaporized DMT is 20–60 milligrams, depending highly on the efficiency of vaporization as well as body weight and personal variation. In general, this is inhaled in a few successive breaths, but lower doses can be used if the user can inhale it in fewer breaths (ideally one). The effects last for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, dependent on the dose. The onset after inhalation is very fast (less than 45 seconds) and peak effects are reached within a minute. In the 1960s, DMT was known as a &quot;businessman&#x27;s trip&quot; in the US because of the relatively short duration (and rapid onset) of action when inhaled. DMT can be inhaled using a bong, typically when sandwiched between layers of plant matter, using a specially designed pipe, or by using an e-cigarette once it has been dissolved in propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin. Some users have also started using vaporizers meant for cannabis extracts (&quot;wax pens&quot;) for ease of temperature control when vaporizing crystals. A DMT-infused smoking blend is called Changa, and is typically used in pipes or other utensils meant for smoking dried plant matter.

===Intravenous injection===
In a study conducted from 1990 through 1995, University of New Mexico psychiatrist Rick Strassman found that some volunteers injected with high doses of DMT reported experiences with perceived alien entities. Usually, the reported entities were experienced as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality that the subjects reported visiting while under the influence of DMT.

In 2023, a study investigated a novel method of DMT administration involving a bolus injection paired with a constant-rate infusion, with the goal of extending the DMT experience.

===Oral===

DMT is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase through a process called deamination, and is quickly inactivated orally unless combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The traditional South American beverage ayahuasca is derived by boiling &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; with leaves of one or more plants containing DMT, such as &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot;, &quot;Psychotria carthagenensis&quot;, or &quot;Diplopterys cabrerana&quot;. The &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; contains harmala alkaloids, a highly active reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), rendering the DMT orally active by protecting it from deamination. A variety of different recipes are used to make the brew depending on the purpose of the ayahuasca session, or local availability of ingredients. Two common sources of DMT in the western US are reed canary grass (&quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot;) and Harding grass (&quot;Phalaris aquatica&quot;). These invasive grasses contain low levels of DMT and other alkaloids but also contain gramine, which is toxic and difficult to separate. In addition, Jurema (&quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot;) shows evidence of DMT content: the pink layer in the inner rootbark of this small tree contains a high concentration of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-DMT.

Taken orally with an RIMA, DMT produces a long-lasting (over three hours), slow, deep metaphysical experience similar to that of psilocybin mushrooms, but more intense.

The intensity of orally administered DMT depends on the type and dose of MAOI administered alongside it. When ingested with 120 mg of harmine (a RIMA and member of the harmala alkaloids), 20 mg of DMT was reported to have psychoactive effects by author and ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott. Ott reported that to produce a visionary state, the threshold oral dose was 30 mg DMT alongside 120 mg harmine. This is not necessarily indicative of a standard dose, as dose-dependent effects may vary due to individual variations in drug metabolism.

==History==
Naturally occurring substances (of both vegetable and animal origin) containing DMT have been used in South America since pre-Columbian times.

DMT was first synthesized in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske. In general, its discovery as a natural product is credited to Brazilian chemist and microbiologist Oswaldo Gonçalves de Lima, who isolated an alkaloid he named &quot;nigerina&quot; (nigerine) from the root bark of &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot; in 1946. However, in a careful review of the case Jonathan Ott shows that the empirical formula for nigerine determined by Gonçalves de Lima, which notably contains an atom of oxygen, can match only a partial, &quot;impure&quot; or &quot;contaminated&quot; form of DMT. It was only in 1959, when Gonçalves de Lima provided American chemists a sample of &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot; roots, that DMT was unequivocally identified in this plant material. Less ambiguous is the case of isolation and formal identification of DMT in 1955 in seeds and pods of &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; by a team of American chemists led by Evan Horning (1916–1993). Since 1955, DMT has been found in a number of organisms: in at least fifty plant species belonging to ten families, and in at least four animal species, including one gorgonian and three mammalian species (including humans).

In terms of a scientific understanding, the hallucinogenic properties of DMT were not uncovered until 1956 by Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist Stephen Szara. In his paper &quot;Dimethyltryptamin: Its Metabolism in Man; the Relation of its Psychotic Effect to the Serotonin Metabolism&quot;, Szara employed synthetic DMT, synthesized by the method of Speeter and Anthony, which was then administered to 20 volunteers by intramuscular injection. Urine samples were collected from these volunteers for the identification of DMT metabolites. This is considered to be the converging link between the chemical structure DMT to its cultural consumption as a psychoactive and religious sacrament.

Another historical milestone is the discovery of DMT in plants frequently used by Amazonian natives as additive to the vine &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; to make ayahuasca decoctions. In 1957, American chemists Francis Hochstein and Anita Paradies identified DMT in an &quot;aqueous extract&quot; of leaves of a plant they named &quot;Prestonia amazonicum&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] and described as &quot;commonly mixed&quot; with &quot;B. caapi&quot;. The lack of a proper botanical identification of &quot;Prestonia amazonica&quot; in this study led American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2001) and other scientists to raise serious doubts about the claimed plant identity. The mistake likely led the writer William Burroughs to regard the DMT he experimented with in Tangier in 1961 as &quot;Prestonia&quot;. Better evidence was produced in 1965 by French pharmacologist Jacques Poisson, who isolated DMT as a sole alkaloid from leaves, provided and used by Aguaruna Indians, identified as having come from the vine &quot;Diplopterys cabrerana&quot; (then known as &quot;Banisteriopsis rusbyana&quot;). Published in 1970, the first identification of DMT in the plant &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot;, another common additive of ayahuasca, was made by a team of American researchers led by pharmacologist Ara der Marderosian. Not only did they detect DMT in leaves of &quot;P. viridis&quot; obtained from Kaxinawá indigenous people, but they also were the first to identify it in a sample of an ayahuasca decoction, prepared by the same indigenous people.

==Chemistry==
=== Appearance and form ===
DMT is commonly handled and stored as a hemifumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic and will not readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT hemifumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point.

DMT is a lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 2.57.

=== Synthesis ===

==== Biosynthesis ====
Dimethyltryptamine is an indole alkaloid derived from the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid -tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals -tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of -tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-&quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into &quot;S&quot;-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product &quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown &quot;ex vivo&quot; to be among the most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.

This transmethylation mechanism has been repeatedly and consistently proven by radiolabeling of SAM methyl group with carbon-14 ((14C-CH3)SAM).

==== Laboratory synthesis ====
DMT can be synthesized through several possible pathways from different starting materials. The two most commonly encountered synthetic routes are through the reaction of indole with oxalyl chloride followed by reaction with dimethylamine and reduction of the carbonyl functionalities with lithium aluminium hydride to form DMT. The second commonly encountered route is through the &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylation of tryptamine using formaldehyde followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Sodium borohydride can be used but requires a larger excess of reagents and lower temperatures due to it having a higher selectivity for carbonyl groups as opposed to imines. Procedures using sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (presumably created &quot;in situ&quot; from cyanoborohydride though this may not be the case due to the presence of water or methanol) also result in the creation of cyanated tryptamine and &quot;beta&quot;-carboline byproducts of unknown toxicity while using sodium borohydride in absence of acid does not. Bufotenine, a plant extract, can also be synthesized into DMT. 

Alternatively, an excess of methyl iodide or methyl &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonate and sodium carbonate can be used to over-methylate tryptamine, resulting in the creation of a quaternary ammonium salt, which is then dequaternized (demethylated) in ethanolamine to yield DMT. The same two-step procedure is used to synthesize other &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylated compounds, such as 5-MeO-DMT.

===Clandestine manufacture===
In a clandestine setting, DMT is not typically synthesized due to the lack of availability of the starting materials, namely tryptamine and oxalyl chloride. Instead, it is more often extracted from plant sources using a nonpolar hydrocarbon solvent such as naphtha or heptane, and a base such as sodium hydroxide.

Alternatively, an acid–base extraction is sometimes used instead.

A variety of plants contain DMT at sufficient levels for being viable sources, but specific plants such as &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora, Acacia acuminata&quot; and &quot;Acacia confusa&quot; are most often used.

The chemicals involved in the extraction are commonly available. The plant material may be illegal to procure in some countries. The end product (DMT) is illegal in most countries.

===Evidence in mammals===
Published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1961, Julius Axelrod found an &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase enzyme capable of mediating biotransformation of tryptamine into DMT in a rabbit&#x27;s lung. This finding initiated a still ongoing scientific interest in endogenous DMT production in humans and other mammals. From then on, two major complementary lines of evidence have been investigated: localization and further characterization of the &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase enzyme, and analytical studies looking for endogenously produced DMT in body fluids and tissues.

In 2013, researchers reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.

A study published in 2014 reported the biosynthesis of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the human melanoma cell line SK-Mel-147 including details on its metabolism by peroxidases.
It is assumed that more than half of the amount of DMT produced by the acidophilic cells of the pineal gland is secreted before and during death, the amount being 2.5–3.4 mg/kg. However, this claim by Strassman has been criticized by David Nichols who notes that DMT does not appear to be produced in any meaningful amount by the pineal gland. Removal or calcification of the pineal gland does not induce any of the symptoms caused by removal of DMT. The symptoms presented are consistent solely with reduction in melatonin, which is the pineal gland&#x27;s known function. Nichols instead suggests that dynorphin and other endorphins are responsible for the reported euphoria experienced by patients during a near-death experience.
In 2014, researchers demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT through the Sigma-1 receptor of human immune cells. This immunomodulatory activity may contribute to significant anti-inflammatory effects and tissue regeneration.

====Endogenous DMT====
&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic compound identified endogenously in mammals, is biosynthesized by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and indolethylamine-&quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT). Studies have investigated brain expression of INMT transcript in rats and humans, coexpression of INMT and AADC mRNA in rat brain and periphery, and brain concentrations of DMT in rats. INMT transcripts were identified in the cerebral cortex, pineal gland, and choroid plexus of both rats and humans via &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization. Notably, INMT mRNA was colocalized with AADC transcript in rat brain tissues, in contrast to rat peripheral tissues where there existed little overlapping expression of INMT with AADC transcripts. Additionally, extracellular concentrations of DMT in the cerebral cortex of normal behaving rats, with or without the pineal gland, were similar to those of canonical monoamine neurotransmitters including serotonin. A significant increase of DMT levels in the rat visual cortex was observed following induction of experimental cardiac arrest, a finding independent of an intact pineal gland. These results show for the first time that the rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT at concentrations comparable to known monoamine neurotransmitters and raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.

The first claimed detection of endogenous DMT in mammals was published in June 1965: German researchers F. Franzen and H. Gross report to have evidenced and quantified DMT, along with its structural analog bufotenin (5-HO-DMT), in human blood and urine. In an article published four months later, the method used in their study was strongly criticized, and the credibility of their results challenged.

Few of the analytical methods used prior to 2001 to measure levels of endogenously formed DMT had enough sensitivity and selectivity to produce reliable results. Gas chromatography, preferably coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is considered a minimum requirement. A study published in 2005 implements the most sensitive and selective method ever used to measure endogenous DMT: liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) allows for reaching limits of detection (LODs) 12 to 200 fold lower than those attained by the best methods employed in the 1970s. The data summarized in the table below are from studies conforming to the abovementioned requirements (abbreviations used: CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; LOD = limit of detection; &quot;n&quot; = number of samples; ng/L and ng/kg = nanograms (10−9 g) per litre, and nanograms per kilogram, respectively):

A 2013 study found DMT in microdialysate obtained from a rat&#x27;s pineal gland, providing evidence of endogenous DMT in the mammalian brain. In 2019 experiments showed that the rat brain is capable of synthesizing and releasing DMT. These results raise the possibility that this phenomenon may occur similarly in human brains.

===Detection in human body fluids===
DMT may be measured in blood, plasma or urine using chromatographic techniques as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. In general, blood or plasma DMT levels in recreational users of the drug are in the 10–30 μg/L range during the first several hours post-ingestion. Less than 0.1% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans.

====INMT====
Before techniques of molecular biology were used to localize indolethylamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like tryptamine are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays are not required to be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT. The essentially qualitative method thin layer chromatography (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies. Also, robust evidence that INMT can catalyze transmethylation of tryptamine into NMT and DMT could be provided with reverse isotope dilution analysis coupled to mass spectrometry for rabbit and human lung during the early 1970s.

Selectivity rather than sensitivity proved to be a challenge for some TLC methods with the discovery in 1974–1975 that incubating rat blood cells or brain tissue with (14C-CH3)SAM and NMT as substrate mostly yields tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives, and negligible amounts of DMT in brain tissue. It is indeed simultaneously realized that the TLC methods used thus far in almost all published studies on INMT and DMT biosynthesis are incapable to resolve DMT from those tetrahydro-β-carbolines. These findings are a blow for all previous claims of evidence of INMT activity and DMT biosynthesis in avian and mammalian brain, including in vivo, as they all relied upon use of the problematic TLC methods: their validity is doubted in replication studies that make use of improved TLC methods, and fail to evidence DMT-producing INMT activity in rat and human brain tissues. Published in 1978, the last study attempting to evidence in vivo INMT activity and DMT production in brain (rat) with TLC methods finds biotransformation of radiolabeled tryptamine into DMT to be real but &quot;insignificant&quot;. Capability of the method used in this latter study to resolve DMT from tetrahydro-β-carbolines is questioned later.

To localize INMT, a qualitative leap is accomplished with use of modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from seven specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT to be present in large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland. A 2020 study using in-situ hybridization, a far more accurate tool than the northern blot analysis, found mRNA coding for INMT expressed in the human cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and pineal gland.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
DMT binds non-selectively with affinities below 0.6 μmol/L to the following serotonin receptors: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. An agonist action has been determined at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. Its efficacies at other serotonin receptors remain to be determined. Of special interest will be the determination of its efficacy at human 5-HT2B receptor as two &quot;in vitro&quot; assays evidenced DMT&#x27;s high affinity for this receptor: 0.108 μmol/L and 0.184 μmol/L. This may be of importance because chronic or frequent uses of serotonergic drugs showing preferential high affinity and clear agonism at 5-HT2B receptor have been causally linked to valvular heart disease.

It has also been shown to possess affinity for the dopamine D1, α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, imidazoline-1, and σ1 receptors. Converging lines of evidence established activation of the σ1 receptor at concentrations of 50–100 μmol/L. Its efficacies at the other receptor binding sites are unclear. It has also been shown &quot;in vitro&quot; to be a substrate for the cell-surface serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in human platelets, and the rat vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which was transiently expressed in fall armyworm Sf9 cells. DMT inhibited SERT-mediated serotonin uptake into platelets at an average concentration of 4.00 ± 0.70 μmol/L and VMAT2-mediated serotonin uptake at an average concentration of 93 ± 6.8 μmol/L. In addition, DMT is a potent serotonin releasing agent with an value of 81 to 114nM.

As with other so-called &quot;classical hallucinogens&quot;, a large part of DMT psychedelic effects can be attributed to a functionally selective activation of the 5-HT2A receptor. DMT concentrations eliciting 50% of its maximal effect (half maximal effective concentration = EC50) at the human 5-HT2A receptor &quot;in vitro&quot; are in the 0.118–0.983 μmol/L range. This range of values coincides well with the range of concentrations measured in blood and plasma after administration of a fully psychedelic dose (see Pharmacokinetics).

DMT is one of the only psychedelics that isn&#x27;t known to produce tolerance to its hallucinogenic effects. The lack of tolerance with DMT may be related to the fact that, unlike other psychedelics such as LSD and DOI, DMT does not desensitize serotonin 5-HT2A receptors &quot;in vitro&quot;. This may be due to the fact that DMT is a biased agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. More specifically, DMT activates the Gq signaling pathway of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor without significantly recruiting β-arrestin2. Activation of β-arrestin2 is linked to receptor downregulation and tachyphylaxis. Similarly to DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is a biased agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, with minimal β-arrestin2 recruitment, and likewise has been associated with little tolerance to its hallucinogenic effects.

As DMT has been shown to have slightly better efficacy (EC50) at human serotonin 2C receptor than at the 2A receptor, 5-HT2C is also likely implicated in DMT&#x27;s overall effects. Other receptors such as 5-HT1A and σ1 may also play a role.

In 2009, it was hypothesized that DMT may be an endogenous ligand for the σ1 receptor. The concentration of DMT needed for σ1 activation &quot;in vitro&quot; (50–100 μmol/L) is similar to the behaviorally active concentration measured in mouse brain of approximately 106 μmol/L This is minimally 4 orders of magnitude higher than the average concentrations measured in rat brain tissue or human plasma under basal conditions (see Endogenous DMT), so σ1 receptors are likely to be activated only under conditions of high local DMT concentrations. If DMT is stored in synaptic vesicles, such concentrations might occur during vesicular release. To illustrate, while the &quot;average&quot; concentration of serotonin in brain tissue is in the 1.5–4 μmol/L range, the concentration of serotonin in synaptic vesicles was measured at 270 mM. Following vesicular release, the resulting concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, to which serotonin receptors are exposed, is estimated to be about 300 μmol/L. Thus, while &quot;in vitro&quot; receptor binding affinities, efficacies, and average concentrations in tissue or plasma are useful, they are not likely to predict DMT concentrations in the vesicles or at synaptic or intracellular receptors. Under these conditions, notions of receptor selectivity are moot, and it seems probable that most of the receptors identified as targets for DMT (see above) participate in producing its psychedelic effects.

In September 2020, an &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; study found that DMT present in the ayahuasca infusion promotes neurogenesis, meaning it helps with generating neurons.

===Pharmacokinetics===
DMT peak level concentrations (&quot;C&quot;max) measured in whole blood after intramuscular (IM) injection (0.7 mg/kg, &quot;n&quot; = 11) and in plasma following intravenous (IV) administration (0.4 mg/kg, &quot;n&quot; = 10) of fully psychedelic doses are in the range of around 14 to 154 μg/L and 32 to 204 μg/L, respectively.

The corresponding molar concentrations of DMT are therefore in the range of 0.074–0.818 μmol/L in whole blood and 0.170–1.08 μmol in plasma. However, several studies have described active transport and accumulation of DMT into rat and dog brains following peripheral administration.

Similar active transport, and accumulation processes likely occur in human brains and may concentrate DMT in brain by several-fold or more (relatively to blood), resulting in local concentrations in the micromolar or higher range. Such concentrations would be commensurate with serotonin brain tissue concentrations, which have been consistently determined to be in the 1.5–4 μmol/L range.

Closely coextending with peak psychedelic effects, mean time to reach peak concentrations (&quot;T&quot;max) was determined to be 10–15 minutes in whole blood after IM injection, and 2 minutes in plasma after IV administration. When taken orally mixed in an ayahuasca decoction, and in freeze-dried ayahuasca gel caps, DMT &quot;T&quot;max is considerably delayed: 107.59 ± 32.5 minutes, and 90–120 minutes, respectively.

The pharmacokinetics for vaporizing DMT have not been studied or reported.

Due to its lipophilicity, DMT easily crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the central nervous system.

==Interactions==
A clinical study of people with depression found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) did not diminish the effects of DMT and instead resulted in greater mystical experience, emotional breakthrough, and ego dissolution scores with DMT than in people with depression not on antidepressants. This was in contrast to previous research finding that SSRIs diminished the effects of serotonergic psychedelics.

==Society and culture==

=== Legal status ===

==== International law ====

Internationally DMT is illegal to possess without authorisation, exemption or license, but ayahuasca and DMT brews and preparations are lawful. DMT is controlled by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances at the international level. The Convention makes it illegal to possess, buy, purchase, sell, to retail and to dispense without a licence.

==== By continent and country ====

In some countries, ayahuasca is a forbidden or controlled or regulated substance, while in other countries it is not a controlled substance or its production, consumption, and sale, is allowed to various degrees.

===== Asia =====
* Israel – DMT is an illegal substance; production, trade and possession are prosecuted as crimes.
* India – DMT is illegal to produce, transport, trade in or possess with a minimum prison or jail punishment of ten years.

===== Europe =====
* France – DMT, along with most of its plant sources, is classified as a &quot;stupéfiant&quot; (narcotic).
* Germany – DMT is prohibited as a class I drug.
*Republic of Ireland – DMT is an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. An attempt in 2014 by a member of the Santo Daime church to gain a religious exemption to import the drug failed.
* Latvia — DMT is prohibited as a Schedule I drug.
* Netherlands – The drug is banned as it is classified as a List 1 Drug per the Opium Law. Production, trade and possession of DMT are prohibited.
* Russia – Classified as a Schedule I narcotic, including its derivatives (see sumatriptan and zolmitriptan).
* Serbia – DMT, along with stereoisomers and salts is classified as List 4 (Psychotropic substances) substance according to Act on Control of Psychoactive Substances.
* Sweden – DMT is considered a Schedule 1 drug. The Swedish supreme court concluded in 2018 that possession of processed plant material containing a significant amount of DMT is illegal. However, possession of unprocessed such plant material was ruled legal. 
* United Kingdom – DMT is classified as a Class A drug.
* Belgium – DMT cannot be possessed, sold, purchased or imported. Usage is not specifically prohibited, but since usage implies possession one could be prosecuted that way.

===== North America =====
* Canada – DMT is classified as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but is legal for religious groups to use. In 2017 the Santo Daime Church Céu do Montréal received religious exemption to use ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.

*United States – DMT is classified in the United States as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

In December 2004, the Supreme Court lifted a stay, thereby allowing the Brazil-based União do Vegetal (UDV) church to use a decoction containing DMT in their Christmas services that year. This decoction is a tea made from boiled leaves and vines, known as hoasca within the UDV, and ayahuasca in different cultures. In &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal&quot;, the Supreme Court heard arguments on 1 November 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the UDV to import and consume the tea for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

In September 2008, the three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea. The case, &quot;Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey&quot;, presided over by U.S. District Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. As of 21 March 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. Panner issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of &quot;Daime tea&quot;. Panner&#x27;s order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order.

===== Oceania =====
* New Zealand – DMT is classified as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.
* Australia – DMT is listed as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as &quot;Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO.&quot; Between 2011 and 2012, the Australian federal government was considering changes to the Australian Criminal Code that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as &quot;controlled plants&quot;. DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing mescaline or ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official Floral Emblem of Australia, Acacia pycnantha (Golden Wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious people). Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 6.0 g (3/16 oz) of DMT is considered enough to determine a court of trial and 2.0 g (1/16 oz) is considered intent to sell and supply.

===Black market===
Electronic cigarette cartridges or vape pens filled with DMT started to be sold on the black market in 2018.

<doc id="8750" wikidata="Q1138573" url="?curid=8750" title="Da capo">
<text>Da capo ( , , ; often abbreviated as D.C.) is an Italian musical term that means &quot;from the beginning&quot; (literally, &quot;from the head&quot;). The term is a directive to repeat the previous part of music, often used to save space, and thus is an easier way of saying to repeat the music from the beginning.

In small pieces, this might be the same thing as a repeat. But in larger works, D.C. might occur after one or more repeats of small sections, indicating a return to the very beginning. The resulting structure of the piece is generally in ternary form. Sometimes, the composer describes the part to be repeated, for example: &quot;Menuet da capo&quot;. In opera, where an aria of this structure is called a &quot;da capo aria&quot;, the repeated section is often adorned with grace notes.

The word &quot;Fine&quot; (Ital. &#x27;end&#x27;) is generally placed above the stave at the point where the movement ceases after a &#x27;Da capo&#x27; repetition. Its place is occasionally taken by a pause (see fermata).&quot;

==Variations==

* Da Capo al Fine (often abbreviated as D.C. al Fine): Repeat from beginning to the end, or up to the word &quot;Fine&quot; (should that appear at the end of the passage)—the word &quot;Fine&quot; itself signifying the end.

* Da Capo al Coda (often abbreviated as D.C. al Coda): Repeat from beginning to an indicated place and then play the tail part (the &quot;Coda&quot;). It directs the musician to go back and repeat the music from the beginning (&quot;Capo&quot;), and to continue playing until one reaches the first coda symbol. Upon reaching the first coda symbol, skip to the second coda symbol and continue playing until the end. The portion of the piece from the second coda to the end is often referred to as the &quot;coda&quot; of the piece, or quite literally as &quot;the tail&quot;. This may also be instructed by simply using the words &quot;al Coda&quot; after which the musician is to skip to the written word &quot;Coda&quot;.
* Da Capo al Segno (often abbreviated as D.C. al Segno): It means &quot;From the beginning to the sign (𝄋)&quot;.

== See also ==
* Coda (music)
* Repeat sign
* Dal segno (DS al coda)

<doc id="8751" wikidata="Q540391" url="?curid=8751" title="Dominatrix">
<text>A dominatrix ( ; or dominatrices ), or domme, is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. The BDSM practice is called female dominance, or femdom. A dominatrix can be of any sexual orientation, but this does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. Dominatrices are popularly known for inflicting physical pain on their submissive subjects, but this is not done in every case. In some instances erotic humiliation is used, such as verbal humiliation or the assignment of humiliating tasks. Dominatrices also make use of other forms of servitude. Practices of domination common to many BDSM and other various sexual relationships are also prevalent. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (&quot;pro-domme&quot;) as the term &quot;dominatrix&quot; is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.

==Terminology and etymology==
&quot;Dominatrix&quot; is the feminine form of the Latin &quot;dominator&quot;, a ruler or lord, and was originally used in a non-sexual sense. Its use in English dates back to at least 1561. Its earliest recorded use in the prevalent modern sense, as a female dominant in sadomasochism, dates to 1961. It was initially coined to describe a woman who provides punishment-for-pay as one of the case studies within Bruce Roger&#x27;s pulp paperback &quot;The Bizarre Lovemakers&quot;. The term was taken up shortly after by the Myron Kosloff title &quot;Dominatrix&quot; (with art by Eric Stanton) in 1968, and entered more popular mainstream knowledge following the 1976 film &quot;Dominatrix Without Mercy&quot;.

The term &quot;domme&quot; is likely a coined pseudo-French feminine inflection of the slang &quot;dom&quot; (short for &quot;dominant&quot;). The use of &quot;domme&quot;, &quot;dominatrix&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, or &quot;dominant&quot; by any woman in a dominant role is chosen mostly by personal preference and the conventions of the local BDSM scene. The term mistress or dominant mistress is sometimes also used. Female dominance (also known as female domination or femdom) is a BDSM activity in which the dominant partner is female. However, while the term &quot;mistress&quot; is often used in the media, members of the BDSM community often avoid it, as it can be confused with &quot;mistress&quot; in the sense of a woman who has an illicit relationship with a married man, a term which has the negative implication of cheating on a partner. Since there is a large overlap between the BDSM and polyamory communities, where ethical conduct is a prime concern, any such relationship is a source of disapproval.

Although the term &quot;dominatrix&quot; was not used, the classic example in literature of the female dominant-male submissive relationship is portrayed in the 1870 novella &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; by Austrian writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The term &quot;masochism&quot; was later derived from the author&#x27;s name by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in the latter&#x27;s 1886 forensic study &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;.

==History==
The history of the dominatrix is argued to date back to rituals of the goddess Inanna (or Ishtar as she was known in Akkadian), in ancient Mesopotamia. Ancient cuneiform texts consisting of &quot;Hymns to Inanna&quot; have been cited as examples of the archetype of powerful, sexual female displaying dominating behaviors and forcing gods and men into submission to her. The pseudonymous archaeologist and BDSM historian Anne O. Nomis notes that Inanna&#x27;s rituals included cross-dressing of cult personnel, and rituals &quot;imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves with weeping and grief.&quot;

The fictional tale of Phyllis and Aristotle, which became popular and gained numerous versions from the 12th century onwards, tells the story of a dominant woman who seduced and dominated the male intellect of the greatest philosopher. In the story, Phyllis forces Aristotle to kneel on the ground so that she rides on his back while whipping and verbally humiliating him.

The profession appears to have originated as a specialization within brothels, before becoming its own unique craft. As far back as the 1590s, flagellation within an erotic setting is recorded. The profession features in erotic prints of the era, such as the British Museum mezzotint &quot;The Cully Flaug&#x27;d&quot; (c. 1674–1702), and in accounts of forbidden books which record the flogging schools and the activities practised.

Within the 18th century, female &quot;Birch Disciplinarians&quot; advertised their services in a book masked as a collection of lectures or theatrical plays, entitled &quot;Fashionable Lectures&quot; (c. 1761). This included the names of 57 women, some actresses and courtesans, who catered to birch discipline fantasies, keeping a room with rods and cat o&#x27; nine tails, and charging their clients a Guinea for a &quot;lecture&quot;.

The 19th century is characterised by what Nomis characterises as the &quot;Golden Age of the Governess&quot;. No fewer than twenty establishments were documented as having existed by the 1840s, supported entirely by flagellation practices and known as &quot;Houses of Discipline&quot; distinct from brothels. Amongst the well-known &quot;dominatrix governesses&quot; were Mrs Chalmers, Mrs Noyeau, the late Mrs Jones of Hertford Street and London Street, the late Mrs Theresa Berkley, Bessy Burgess of York Square and Mrs Pyree of Burton Crescent. The most famous of these Governess &quot;female flagellants&quot; was Theresa Berkley, who operated her establishment on Charlotte Street in the central London district of Marylebone. She is recorded to have used implements such as whips, canes and birches, to chastise and punish her male clients, as well as the Berkley Horse, a specially designed flogging machine, and a pulley suspension system for lifting them off the floor. Such historical use of corporal punishment and suspension, in a setting of domination roleplay, connects very closely to the practices of modern-day professional dominatrices.

The &quot;bizarre style&quot; (as it came to be called) of leather catsuits, claws, tail whips, and latex rubber only came about in the 20th century, initially within commercial fetish photography, and taken up by dominatrices. Within the mid-20th century, dominatrices operated in a very discreet and underground manner, which has made them difficult to trace within the historical record. A few photographs still exist of the women who ran their domination businesses in London, New York, The Hague and Hamburg&#x27;s Herbertstraße, predominantly in sepia and black-and-white photographs, and scans from magazine articles, copied and re-copied. Amongst these were Miss Doreen of London who was acquainted with John Sutcliffe of &quot;AtomAge&quot; fame, whose clients reportedly included Britain&#x27;s top politicians and businessmen. In New York, the dominatrix Anne Laurence was known within the underground circle of acquaintances during the 1950s, with Monique Von Cleef arriving in the early 1960s, and hitting national headlines when her home was raided by police detectives on 22 December 1965. Von Cleef went on to set up her &quot;House of Pain&quot; in The Hague in the 1970s, which became one of the world capitals for dominatrices, reportedly with visiting lawyers, ambassadors, diplomats and politicians. Domenica Niehoff worked as a dominatrix in Hamburg and appeared on talk shows on German television from the 1970s onwards, campaigning for sex workers&#x27; rights. Mistress Raven, founder and manager of Pandora&#x27;s Box, one of New York&#x27;s best known BDSM studios, was featured in Nick Broomfield&#x27;s 1996 documentary film &quot;Fetishes&quot;.

==Professional dominatrices==

The term &quot;dominatrix&quot; is mostly used to describe a female professional dominant (or &quot;pro-domme&quot;) who is paid to engage in BDSM play with a submissive. Professional dominatrices are not prostitutes, despite the sensual and erotic interactions they have. An appointment or roleplay is referred to as a &quot;session&quot;, and is often conducted in a dedicated professional play space which has been set up with specialist equipment, known as a &quot;dungeon&quot;. Sessions may also be conducted remotely by letter or telephone, or in the contemporary era of technological connectivity by email, online chat or platforms such as OnlyFans. Most, but not all, clients of female professional dominants are men. Male professional dominants also exist, catering predominantly to the gay male market.

Women who engage in female domination typically promote and title themselves under the terms &quot;dominatrix&quot;, &quot;mistress&quot;, &quot;lady&quot;, &quot;madame&quot;, &quot;&quot; (German for &quot;mistress&quot;) or &quot;goddess&quot;. In a study of German dominatrices, Andrew Wilson said that the trend for dominatrices choosing names aimed at creating and maintaining an atmosphere in which class, femininity and mystery are key elements of their self-constructed identity.

Some professional dominatrices set minimum age limits for their clients. Popular requests from clients are for dungeon play including bondage, spanking and cock and ball torture, or for medical play using hoods, gas masks and urethral sounding. Verbal erotic humiliation, such as small penis humiliation, is also popular. There are some professional dominatrices that engage in sexual contact activities such as facesitting, handjobs or fellatio but others disapprove of this. Other BDSM activities can include various forms of body worship, such as foot worship, ass worship, breast worship and pussy worship; tease and denial; corporal punishment including breast torture, caning, whipping; orgasm denial; and as well as face slapping, hair pulling, dripping hot wax on the genitals, spitting, golden showers, &quot;forced&quot; chastity, cock and ball torture, and pussy torture.

It is not unusual for a dominatrix to consider her profession different from that of an escort and not perform tie and tease or &quot;happy endings&quot;. Typically professional dominatrices do not have sexual intercourse with their clients, do not become naked with their clients and do not allow their clients to touch them. The Canadian dominatrix Terri-Jean Bedford, who was one of three women who initiated an application in the Ontario Superior Court seeking invalidation of Canada&#x27;s laws regarding brothels, sought to differentiate for clarity her occupation as a dominatrix rather than a prostitute to the media, due to frequent misunderstanding and conflation by the public of the two terms.

That being said, it is now generally accepted that a professional dominatrix is a sex worker, and many of the acts conducted during a session may be interpreted as equally sexual to the participants.

While dominatrices come from many different backgrounds, it has been shown that a considerable number are well-educated. Research into US dominatrices published in 2012 indicated that 39% of the sample studied had received some sort of graduate training.

A 1985 study suggested that about 30 percent of participants in BDSM subculture were female. A 1994 report indicated that around a quarter of the women who took part in BDSM subculture did so professionally. In a 1995 study of Internet discussion group messages, the preference for the dominant-initiator role was expressed by 11% of messages by heterosexual women, compared to 71% of messages by heterosexual men.

Professional dominatrices can be seen advertising their services online and in print publications which carry erotic services advertising, such as contact magazines and fetish magazines that specialise in female domination. The precise number of women actively offering professional domination services is unknown. Most professional dominatrices practice in large metropolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and London, with as many as 200 women working as dominatrices in Los Angeles.

Professional dominatrices may take pride or differentiation in their psychological insight into their clients&#x27; fetishes and desires, as well as their technical ability to perform complex BDSM practices, such as Japanese shibari, head-scissoring, and other forms of bondage, suspension, torture roleplay, and corporal punishment, and other such practices which require a high degree of knowledge and competency to safely oversee. From a sociological point of view, Danielle Lindemann has stated the &quot;embattled purity regime&quot; in which many pro-dommes emphasise their specialist knowledge and professional skills, while distancing themselves from economic criteria for success, in a way which is comparable to avant-garde artists.

Some dominatrices practice financial domination, or findom, a fetish in which a submissive is aroused by sending money or gifts to a dominatrix at her instruction. In some cases the dominatrix is given control of the submissive&#x27;s finances or a &quot;blackmail&quot; scenario is acted out. In the majority of cases the dominatrix and the submissive do not physically meet. The interactions are typically performed using the Internet, which is also where such services are advertised. Findom was originally a niche service that a traditional dominatrix would offer, but it has become popular with less-experienced online practitioners.

To differentiate women who identify as a dominatrix but do not offer paid services, non-professional dominants are occasionally referred to as a &quot;lifestyle&quot; dominatrix or Mistress. The term &quot;lifestyle&quot; to signify BDSM is occasionally a contention topic in the BDSM community and that some dominatrices may dislike the term. Some professional dominatrices are also &quot;lifestyle&quot; dominatrices—i.e., in addition to paid sessions with submissive clients they engage in unpaid recreational sessions or may incorporate power exchange within their own private lives and relationships. However, the term has fallen out of general usage with respect to women who are dominant in their private relationships, and has taken on more and more the connotation of &quot;professional&quot;. Nathalie Lugand in her 2023 book &quot;A Psychodynamic Approach to Female Domination in BDSM Relationships&quot; describes this strict separation as artificial.

== Notable dominatrices ==
Catherine Robbe-Grillet is a lifestyle dominatrix. Born in Paris on September 24, 1930, she then became France&#x27;s most famous lifestyle dominatrix. She is also a writer and actress, the widow of nouveau roman pioneer and sadist Alain Robbe-Grillet. She currently lives with Beverly Charpentier, a 51-year-old South African woman who is her submissive companion. Although being such a famous dominatrix, she has never accepted payment for her &quot;ceremonies&quot;. She&#x27;s quoted as saying &quot;If someone pays, then they are in charge. I need to remain free. It is important that everyone involved knows that I do it solely for my pleasure.&quot; &quot;Catherine is my secret garden,&quot; Charpentier says. &quot;I have given myself to her, body and soul. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with either or both, according to her pleasure—and her pleasure is also my pleasure.&quot; Robbe-Grillet has been criticised for writing about S/M stories. She identifies as a &quot;pro-sex feminist&quot; and &quot;the kind of feminist who supports the right of any man or woman to work as a prostitute, if it is their free choice.&quot;

==Imagery==
The dominatrix is a symbolic female archetype. In popular culture, the conception of the dominatrix is generally associated with specialized clothing and props used to signify her role as a strong, dominant, sexualised woman. This role is linked to but distinct from images of sexual fetish. During the twentieth century, dominatrix imagery was developed by the work of a number of artists including the costume designer and photographer Charles Guyette, the publisher and film director Irving Klaw, and the illustrators Eric Stanton and Gene Bilbrew who drew for the fetish magazine &quot;Exotique&quot;.

One of the garments associated with the dominatrix is the catsuit. The black leather female catsuit entered dominant fetish culture in the 1950s with the &quot;AtomAge&quot; magazine and its connections to fetish fashion designer John Sutcliffe. Its appearance in mainstream culture began when catsuits were worn by strong female protagonists in popular 1960s TV programs like &quot;The Avengers&quot; and by comic super-heroines such as Catwoman. The catsuit represented the independence of a woman capable of &quot;kick-ass&quot; moves and action, giving complete freedom of movement. At the same time, the one-piece catsuit accentuated and exaggerated the sexualized female form, providing visual access to a woman&#x27;s body, while simultaneously obstructing physical penetrative access. &quot;You can look but you can&#x27;t touch&quot; is the message, which plays upon the BDSM practice known as &quot;tease and denial&quot;.

Another common image is that of a dominatrix wearing thigh-high boots in leather or shiny PVC, which have long held a fetishistic status and are sometimes called kinky boots, along with very high stiletto heels. Fishnet stockings, seamed hosiery, stockings and garter belts (suspenders) are also used in the representation and attire of dominatrices, to emphasize the form and length of the legs with erotic connotation.

Tight leather corsets are another popular dominatrix garment. Gloves, whether long opera gloves or fingerless gloves, are often a further accessory to emphasize the feminine role. Neck corsets are also sometimes worn.

Dominatrices frequently wear clothing made from fetish fashion materials. Examples include PVC clothing, latex clothing and garments drawn from the leather subculture. In some cases elements of dominatrix attire, such as leather boots and peaked cap, are drawn from Nazi chic, particularly the black SS officer&#x27;s uniform which has been widely adopted and fetishized by underground gay and BDSM lifestyle groups to satisfy a uniform fetish.

A dominatrix often uses strong, dominant body language which is comparable to dominant posturing in the animal world. The props she brandishes signify her role as dominatrix, such as a flogger, whip or riding crop as illustrated in the artwork of Bruno Zach in the early 20th century.

Another often-depicted characteristic of the dominatrix character is of smoking, either of tobacco cigarettes or cannabis products. While smoking tobacco has been in rapid decline worldwide, depiction of it in BDSM literature and media is increasing, as the negative image of smoking reinforces the &quot;bad girl&quot; stereotype associated with a dominatrix.
Practicing professional dominatrices may draw their attire from the conventional imagery associated with the role, or adapt it to create their own individual style. There is a potential conflict between meeting conventional expectations and a desire for dominant independent self-expression. Some contemporary dominatrices draw upon an eclectic range of strong female archetypes, including the goddess, the female superheroine, the femme fatale, the priestess, the empress, the queen, the governess and the KGB secret agent.

== In literature ==
Themes associated with the dominatrix character have appeared in literature since the 10th century. Canoness Hroswitha, in her manuscript &quot;Maria,&quot; uses the word &quot;Dominatrix&quot; for the main character. She is portrayed as an unattainable woman who is too good for any of the men who are in love with her. The theme of &quot;the unattainable woman&quot; has been used thoroughly in medieval literature as well, although it differs from a dominatrix. Medieval themes surrounding the unattainable woman concerned issues of social classes and structure, with chivalry being a prime part of a relationship between a man and woman. There are some exceptions to this trend during medieval times. In Cervantes’ &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605), Celadon is imprisoned by Galatea. Celadon complains that his &quot;mistress . . . Galatea keeps me on such a short leash&quot;. In Robert Herrick&#x27;s &quot;Hesperides&quot;, a book of poems published in 1648, there were three revealing poems &quot;An Hymne to Love&quot;, &quot;The Dream&quot;, and &quot;To Love&quot; which showcase masculine longing for domination, restraint, discipline. In &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce, the character Leopold Bloom has many fantasies of submission to a lady and of receiving whippings from her.

== In popular culture ==
There have been a number of depictions of dominatrices in film and television, almost always featuring a professional dominatrix. Depictions of dominatrices in popular culture include:

* &quot;Euphoria&quot; is a TV series in which Kat Hernandez, portrayed by Barbie Ferreira, moonlights as a dominatrix. She has to hide this part of her life from her friends and family due to societal shame.
* &quot;Bonding&quot; is a TV series in which Tiffany &quot;Tiff&quot; Chester, portrayed by Zoe Levin, is a psychology student by day, and dominatrix &quot;Mistress May&quot; by night. Many viewers have not liked the depictions of a dominatrix in the first season, often citing it as &quot;inaccurate&quot;. However, they hired a consultant who worked as dominatrix for 15 years to assist them in the script for the second season and fix the inaccuracies.
* &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; is a film based on a novel of the same name with a dominatrix-based plot.

<text>The flag of [[Denmark]] (, ) is red with a white Nordic cross, which means that the cross extends to the edges of the flag and that the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side.

A banner with a white-on-red cross is attested as having been used by the kings of Denmark since the 14th century. An origin legend with considerable impact on Danish national historiography connects the introduction of the flag to the Battle of Lindanise of 1219.

The elongated Nordic cross, which represents Christianity, reflects its use as a maritime flag in the 18th century. The flag became popular as a national flag in the early 16th century. Its private use was outlawed in 1834 but again permitted by a regulation of 1854. The flag holds the Guinness world record of being the oldest continuously used national flag, that is since 1625.

==Description==
A 1748 regulation, which is still in force, defines the flag as constructed of two squares of , with a white cross the height of the flag and the two rectangular fields as . Multiplying the proportions by three to get whole numbers gives the proportions in the construction sheet below (28 divided by 4 being 7 for the white cross).

=== Colour ===
No official definition of &quot;Dannebrog rød&quot; exists. The private company &quot;Dansk Standard&quot;, regulation number 359 (2005), defines the red colour of the flag as Pantone 186c.

=== Construction sheet ===
== History ==
=== 1219 origin legend ===
A tradition recorded in the 16th century traces the origin of the flag to the campaigns of Valdemar II of Denmark (r. 1202–1241). The oldest of them is in Christiern Pedersen&#x27;s &quot;Danske Krønike&quot;, which is a sequel to Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s , which was written in 1520 to 1523. Here, the flag falls from the sky during one of Valdemar&#x27;s military campaigns overseas. Pedersen also states that the very same flag was taken into exile by Eric of Pomerania in 1440.

The second source is the writing of the Franciscan friar Petrus Olai (Peder Olsen) of Roskilde (died ). This record describes a battle in 1208 near Fellin during the Estonia campaign of King Valdemar II. The Danes were all but defeated when a lamb-skin banner depicting a white cross fell from the sky and miraculously led to a Danish victory. In a third account, also by Petrus Olai, in &quot;Danmarks Tolv Herligheder&quot; (&quot;Twelve Splendours of Denmark&quot;), in splendour number nine, the same story is retold almost verbatim, with a paragraph inserted correcting the year to 1219. Now, the flag is falling from the sky in the Battle of Lindanise, also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: &quot;Volmerslaget&quot;), near Lindanise (Tallinn) in Estonia, of 15 June 1219.

It is this third account that has been the most influential, and some historians have treated it as the primary account taken from a (lost) source dating to the first half of the 15th century.

In Olai&#x27;s account, the battle was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish bishop, Anders Sunesen, was on top of a hill overlooking the battle and prayed to God with his arms raised. The Danes moved closer to victory as prayed. When he raised his arms, the Danes surged forward, but when his arms grew tired, and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again, and the Danes again surged forward, but for a second time he grew so tired that he dropped his arms, and the Danes again lost the advantage and became closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up (which might be a copycat of Exodus 17:11-12). When the Danes were about to lose, the &quot;Dannebrog&quot; miraculously fell from the sky. The King took it and showed it to the troops, their hearts were filled with courage, and the Danes won the battle.

The possible historical nucleus behind this origin legend was extensively discussed by Danish historians in the 19th to 20th centuries. One such example is Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen, who argued that Bishop Theoderich was the original instigator of the 1218 inquiry from Bishop Albert of Buxhoeveden to King Valdemar II which led to the Danish participation in the Baltic crusades. Jørgensen speculates that Bishop Theoderich might have carried the Knight Hospitaller&#x27;s banner in the 1219 battle and that &quot;the enemy thought this was the King&#x27;s symbol and mistakenly stormed Bishop Theoderich tent. He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle&quot;.

The Danish church-historian L. P. Fabricius (1934) ascribes the origin to the 1208 Battle of Fellin, not the Battle of Lindanise in 1219, based on the earliest source available about the story. Fabricius speculated that it might have been Archbishop Andreas Sunesøn&#x27;s personal ecclesiastical banner or perhaps even the flag of Archbishop Absalon under whose initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in Estonia. The banner would then already be known in Estonia. Fabricius repeats Jørgensen&#x27;s idea about the flag being planted in front of Bishop Theodorik&#x27;s tent, which the enemy mistakenly attacked believing it to be the tent of the King.

A different theory is briefly discussed by Fabricius and elaborated more by Helge Bruhn (1949). Bruhn interprets the story in the context of the widespread tradition of the miraculous appearance of crosses in the sky in Christian legend, specifically comparing such an event attributed to a battle of 10 September 1217 near Alcazar in which it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky and brought victory to the Christians.

In Swedish national historiography of the 18th century, there is a tale paralleling the Danish legend, in which 
a golden cross appears in the blue sky during a Swedish battle in Finland in 1157.

=== Middle Ages ===

The white-on-red cross emblem originates in the age of the Crusades. In the 12th century, it was also used as war flag by the Holy Roman Empire.

In the &quot;Gelre Armorial&quot;, dated 1340–1370, such a banner is shown alongside the coat of arms of the king of Denmark. This is the earliest known undisputed colour rendering of the Dannebrog. About the same time, Valdemar IV of Denmark displays a cross in his coat of arms on his &quot;Danælog&quot; seal (&quot;Rettertingsseglet&quot;, dated 1356). The image from the Armorial Gelre is nearly identical to an image found in a 15th-century coat of arms book now located in the National Archives of Sweden (&quot;Riksarkivet&quot;). The seal of Eric of Pomerania (1398) as king of the Kalmar Union displays the arms of Denmark&#x27;s chief dexter, three lions. In this version, the lions hold a Dannebrog banner.

The reason that the kings of Denmark in the 14th century began displaying the cross banner in their coats of arms is unknown. Caspar Paludan-Müller (1873) suggested that it may reflect a banner sent by the pope to support the king during the Livonian Crusade. Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen (1875) identifies the banner as that of the Knights Hospitaller, an order that had a presence in Denmark from the later 12th century.

Several coins, seals and images exist, both foreign and domestic, from the 13th to the 15th centuries and even earlier and show similar heraldic designs similar, alongside the royal coat of arms (three blue lions on a golden shield.)

There is a record suggesting that the Danish Army had a &quot;chief banner&quot; (&quot;hoffuitbanner&quot;) in the early 16th century. Such a banner is mentioned in 1570 by Niels Hemmingsøn in the context of a 1520 battle between Danes and Swedes near Uppsala as nearly captured by the Swedes but saved by the heroic actions of the banner-carrier Mogens Gyldenstierne and Peder Skram. The legend attributing the miraculous origin of the flag to the campaigns of Valdemar II of Denmark (r. 1202-1241) was recorded by Christiern Pedersen and Petrus Olai in the 1520s.

Hans Svaning&#x27;s &quot;History of King Hans&quot; from 1558 to 1559 and Johan Rantzau&#x27;s &quot;History about the Last Dithmarschen War&quot;, from 1569, record the further fate of the Danish &quot;hoffuitbanner&quot;: According to the tradition, the original flag from the Battle of Lindanise was used in the small campaign of 1500, when King Hans tried to conquer Dithmarschen (in western Holstein in northern Germany). The flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the Battle of Hemmingstedt, on 17 February 1500. In 1559, King Frederik II recaptured it during his own Dithmarschen campaign.

In 1576, the son of Johan Rantzau, Henrik Rantzau, also writes about the war and the fate of the flag, noting that the flag was in a poor condition when returned. He records that the flag after its return to Denmark was placed in the cathedral in Slesvig. Slesvig historian Ulrik Petersen (1656–1735) confirms the presence of such a banner in the cathedral in the early 17th century and records that it had crumbled away by about 1660.

Contemporary records describing the battle of Hemmingstedt make no reference to the loss of the original Dannebrog, although the capitulation state that all Danish banners lost in 1500 was to be returned. In a letter dated 22 February 1500 to Oluf Stigsøn, King John describes the battle but does not mention the loss of an important flag. In fact, the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was of limited importance. In 1598, Neocorus wrote that the banner captured in 1500 was brought to the church in Wöhrden and hung there for the next 59 years until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559.

===Modern period ===

Used as a maritime flag since the 16th century, the Dannebrog was introduced as a regimental flag in the Danish army in 1785, and for the militia (landeværn) in 1801. From 1842, it was used as the flag of the entire army.

During the first half of the 19th century, in parallel to the development of Romantic nationalism in other European countries, the military flag increasingly came to be seen as representing the nation itself. Poems of the period invoking the &quot;Dannebrog&quot; were written by B.S. Ingemann, N.F.S. Grundtvig, Oehlenschläger, Chr. Winther and H.C. Andersen. By the 1830s, the military flag had become popular as an unofficial national flag, and its use by private citizens was outlawed in a circular enacted on 7 January 1834.

In the national enthusiasm sparked by the First Schleswig War from 1848 to 1850, the flag was still very widely displayed, and the prohibition of private use was repealed in a regulation of 7 July 1854 that for the first time allowed Danish citizens to display the Dannebrog (but not the swallow-tailed &quot;Splitflag&quot; variant. Special permission to use the &quot;Splitflag&quot; was given to individual institutions and private companies, especially after 1870. In 1886, the war ministry introduced a regulation indicating that the flag should be flown from military buildings on thirteen specified days, including royal birthdays, the date of the signing of the Constitution of 5 June 1849 and days of remembrance for military battles. In 1913, the naval ministry issued its own list of flag days. On 10 April 1915, the hoisting of any other flag on Danish soil was prohibited. The prohibition was lifted on 24 June 2023, after a Supreme Court ruling. From 1939 to 2012, the yearbook &quot;Hvem-Hvad-Hvor&quot; included a list of flag days. As of 2019, flag days can be viewed at the &quot;Ministry of Justice (Justitsministeriet)&quot; as well as &quot;The Denmark Society (Danmarks-Samfundet)&quot;.

=== Maritime flag and corresponding Kingdom flag ===


The size and shape of the civil ensign (&quot;Koffardiflaget&quot;) for merchant ships is given in the regulation of 11 June 1748, which says: &quot;A red flag with a white cross with no split end. The white cross must be of the flag&#x27;s height. The two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be lengths of those&quot;. The proportions are thus: 3:1:3 vertically and 3:1:4.5 horizontally. This definition are the absolute proportions for the Danish national flag to this day, for both the civil version of the flag (&quot;Stutflaget&quot;), as well as the merchant flag (&quot;Handelsflaget&quot;). The civil flag and the merchant flag are identical in colour and design.

A regulation passed in 1758 required Danish ships sailing in the Mediterranean to carry the royal cypher in the center of the flag to distinguish them from Maltese ships because of its similarity of the flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

According to the regulation of 11 June 1748, the colour was simply red, which is common known today as &quot;Dannebrog rød&quot; (&quot;Dannebrog red&quot;). The only red fabric dye then available was made of madder root, which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye and was used historically for British and Danish and soldiers&#x27; jackets. A regulation of 4 May 1927 once again stated that Danish merchant ships had to fly flags according to the regulation of 1748.

The first regulation regarding the &quot;Splitflag&quot; dates from 27 March 1630, in which King Christian IV ordered that Norwegian &quot;Defensionskibe&quot; (armed merchants ships) were allowed to use only the &quot;Splitflag&quot; if they were in Danish war service. In 1685, an order was distributed to a number of cities in Slesvig and stated that all ships had to carry the Danish flag, and in 1690, all merchant ships were forbidden to use the &quot;Splitflag&quot; except for ships sailing in the East Indies, the West Indies or along the coast of Africa. In 1741, it was confirmed that the regulation of 1690 was still very much in effect that merchant ships were not allowed to use the &quot;Splitflag&quot;. At the same time, the Danish East India Company was allowed to fly the &quot;Splitflag&quot; past the equator.

Some confusion must have existed regarding the &quot;Splitflag&quot;. In 1696 the Admiralty, presented the King with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the &quot;Splitflag&quot;. In the same year, a royal resolution defined the proportions of the &quot;Splitflag&quot;, which was called &quot;Kongeflaget&quot; (the King&#x27;s flag), as follows: &quot;The cross must be of the flags height. The two first fields ,ist be square in form with the sides three times the cross width. The two outer fields are rectangular and the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the flag&quot;.

Those numbers are still the base for the &quot;Splitflag&quot; and the &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; though the numbers have been slightly altered. The term &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; dates from 1806 and denotes its use in the Danish Navy.

From about 1750 to the early 19th century, a number of ships and companies in which the government has interests received approval to use the &quot;Splitflag&quot;.

In the royal resolution of 25 October 1939 for the Danish Navy, it was stated that the &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; is a &quot;Splitflag&quot; with a deep red (&quot;dybrød&quot;) or madder red (&quot;kraprød&quot;) colour. As for the national flag, no shade was given, but it is now stated as 195U. Furthermore, the size and the shape were corrected in the new resolution: &quot;The cross must be of the flag&#x27;s height. The two first fields must be square in form with the height of of the flag&#x27;s height. The two outer fields are rectangular and the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the rectangular fields&quot;. Thus, if compared to the standard of 1696, both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size.

The &quot;Splitflag&quot; and &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; have similar shapes but different sizes and shades of red. Legally, they are two different flags. The &quot;Splitflag&quot; is a Danish flag ending in a swallow-tail, it is &quot;Dannebrog red&quot; and is used on land. The &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; is an elongated &quot;Splitflag&quot; with a deeper red colour and is used only at sea.

The &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; with no markings may be used only by the Royal Danish Navy, but there are a few exceptions. A few institutions have been allowed to fly the clean &quot;Orlogsflag&quot;. The same flag with markings has been approved for a few dozen companies and institutions over the years.

Furthermore, the &quot;Orlogsflag&quot; is described as such only if it has no additional markings. Any swallow-tail flag, no matter the colour, is called a &quot;Splitflag&quot; provided it bears additional markings.

=== Royal standards ===
===Monarch===
The current version of the royal standard was introduced on 1 January 2025. after King Frederik X adopted a new version of his personal coat of arms on 20 December 2024. The royal standard is the flag of Denmark with a swallow-tail and charged with the monarch&#x27;s coat of arms set in a white square. The centre square is 32 parts in a flag with the ratio 56:107.

===Other members of the royal family===
== Other flags in the Kingdom of Denmark ==
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are autonomous territories within the Kingdom of Denmark. They have their own official flags.

Some areas in Denmark have unofficial flags. While they have no legal recognition or regulation, they can be used freely.

The regional flags of Bornholm and Ærø are occasionally used by locals of those islands and in tourist-related businesses.

The proposal for a flag of Jutland has hardly found any actual use, maybe in part because of its peculiar design.

The flag of Vendsyssel (Vendelbrog) is seen infrequently, but locals recognise it. According to an article in the newspaper &quot;Nordjyske&quot;, the flag had been used in the former insignia of Flight Eskadrille 723 of Aalborg Air Base, in the 1980s.

<doc id="8753" wikidata="Q134293" url="?curid=8753" title="Dharma">
<text>Dharma (; , ) is a key concept in the Indian religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The term &quot;dharma&quot; is understood to refer to behaviours which are in harmony with the &quot;order and custom&quot; that sustains life; &quot;virtue&quot;, righteousness or &quot;religious and moral duties&quot;. The antonym of &quot;dharma&quot; is adharma.

The concept of &quot;dharma&quot; was in use in the historical Vedic religion (1500–500 BCE), and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia. In Hinduism, &quot;dharma&quot; denotes behaviours that are considered to be in accord with &quot;Ṛta&quot;—the &quot;order and custom&quot; that makes life and universe possible. This includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and &quot;right way of living&quot;. &quot;Dharma&quot; is believed to have a transtemporal validity, and is one of the Puruṣārtha.

In Buddhism, &quot;dharma&quot; () refers to the teachings of the Buddha. In Buddhist philosophy, &quot;dhamma/dharma&quot; is also the term for &quot;phenomena&quot;. &quot;Dharma&quot; in Jainism refers to the teachings of Tirthankara (Jina) and the body of doctrine pertaining to the purification and moral transformation of humans. In Sikhism, &quot;dharma&quot; indicates the path of righteousness, proper religious practices, and performing one&#x27;s own moral duties.

As with the other components of the Puruṣārtha, the concept of &quot;dharma&quot; is pan-Indian. The ancient Tamil text &quot;Tirukkuṟaḷ&quot;, despite being a collection of aphoristic teachings on dharma (&quot;aram&quot;), artha (&quot;porul&quot;), and kama (&quot;inpam&quot;), is completely and exclusively based on &quot;aṟam&quot;—the Tamil term for &quot;dharma&quot;.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;dharma&quot; () has roots in the Sanskrit &quot;dhr-&quot;, which means &quot;to hold&quot; or &quot;to support&quot;, and is related to Latin &quot;firmus&quot; (firm, stable). From this, it takes the meaning of &quot;what is established or firm&quot;, and hence &quot;law&quot;. It is derived from an older Vedic Sanskrit &quot;n&quot;-stem &quot;dharman-&quot;, with a literal meaning of &quot;bearer, supporter&quot;, in a religious sense conceived as an aspect of Rta.

In the Rigveda, the word appears as an &quot;n&quot;-stem, &quot;&quot;, with a range of meanings encompassing &quot;something established or firm&quot; (in the literal sense of prods or poles). Figuratively, it means &quot;sustainer&quot; and &quot;supporter&quot; (of deities). It is semantically similar to the Greek &quot;themis&quot; (&quot;fixed decree, statute, law&quot;).

In Classical Sanskrit, and in the Vedic Sanskrit of the Atharvaveda, the stem is thematic: &quot;&quot; (Devanagari: धर्म). In Prakrit and Pali, it is rendered &quot;dhamma&quot;. In some contemporary Indian languages and dialects it alternatively occurs as &quot;dharm&quot;.

In the 3rd century BCE the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka translated &quot;dharma&quot; into Greek and Aramaic and he used the Greek word &quot;eusebeia&quot; (εὐσέβεια, piety, spiritual maturity, or godliness) in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription and the Kandahar Greek Edicts. In the former, he used the Aramaic word (&quot;&quot;; truth, rectitude).

==Definition==
Dharma is a concept of central importance in Indian philosophy and Indian religions. It has multiple meanings in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. It is difficult to provide a single concise definition for &quot;dharma&quot;, as the word has a long and varied history and straddles a complex set of meanings and interpretations. There is no equivalent single-word synonym for &quot;dharma&quot; in western languages.

There have been numerous, conflicting attempts to translate ancient Sanskrit literature with the word &quot;dharma&quot; into German, English and French. The concept, claims Paul Horsch, has caused exceptional difficulties for modern commentators and translators. For example, while Grassmann&#x27;s translation of Rig-Veda identifies seven different meanings of dharma, Karl Friedrich Geldner in his translation of the Rig-Veda employs 20 different translations for dharma, including meanings such as &quot;law&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;duty&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, and &quot;model&quot;, among others. However, the word &quot;dharma&quot; has become a widely accepted loanword in English, and is included in all modern unabridged English dictionaries.

The root of the word &quot;dharma&quot; is &quot;dhr̥&quot;, which means &quot;to support, hold, or bear&quot;. It is the thing that regulates the course of change by not participating in change, but that principle which remains constant. &quot;Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary&quot;, the widely cited resource for definitions and explanation of Sanskrit words and concepts of Hinduism, offers numerous definitions of the word &quot;dharma&quot;, such as that which is established or firm, steadfast decree, statute, law, practice, custom, duty, right, justice, virtue, morality, ethics, religion, religious merit, good works, nature, character, quality, property. Yet, each of these definitions is incomplete, while the combination of these translations does not convey the total sense of the word. In common parlance, &quot;dharma&quot; means &quot;right way of living&quot; and &quot;path of rightness&quot;. Dharma also has connotations of order, and when combined with the word &quot;sanatana&quot;, it can also be described as eternal truth.

The meaning of the word &quot;dharma&quot; depends on the context, and its meaning has evolved as ideas of Hinduism have developed through history. In the earliest texts and ancient myths of Hinduism, &quot;dharma&quot; meant cosmic law, the rules that created the universe from chaos, as well as rituals; in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas and the Epics, the meaning became refined, richer, and more complex, and the word was applied to diverse contexts.
In certain contexts, &quot;dharma&quot; designates human behaviours considered necessary for order of things in the universe, principles that prevent chaos, behaviours and action necessary to all life in nature, society, family as well as at the individual level. &quot;Dharma&quot; encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or morally upright. For further context, the word &quot;varnasramdharma&quot; is often used in its place, defined as dharma specifically related to the stage of life one is in. The concept of &quot;Dharma&quot; is believed to have a transtemporal validity.

The antonym of &quot;dharma&quot; is &quot;adharma&quot; (Sanskrit: अधर्म), meaning that which is &quot;not dharma&quot;. As with &quot;dharma&quot;, the word &quot;adharma&quot; includes and implies many ideas; in common parlance, adharma means that which is against nature, immoral, unethical, wrong or unlawful.

In Buddhism, &quot;dharma&quot; incorporates the teachings and doctrines of the founder of Buddhism, the Buddha.

==History==
According to Pandurang Vaman Kane, author of the book &quot;History of Dharmaśāstra&quot;, the word &quot;dharma&quot; appears at least fifty-six times in the hymns of the Rigveda, as an adjective or noun. According to Paul Horsch, the word &quot;dharma&quot; has its origin in Vedic Hinduism. The hymns of the Rigveda claim Brahman created the universe from chaos, they hold (dhar-) the earth and sun and stars apart, they support (dhar-) the sky away and distinct from earth, and they stabilise (dhar-) the quaking mountains and plains. 

The Deities, mainly Indra, then deliver and hold order from disorder, harmony from chaos, stability from instability – actions recited in the Veda with the root of word dharma. In hymns composed after the mythological verses, the word dharma takes expanded meaning as a cosmic principle and appears in verses independent of deities. It evolves into a concept, claims Paul Horsch, that has a dynamic functional sense in Atharvaveda for example, where it becomes the cosmic law that links cause and effect through a subject. Dharma, in these ancient texts, also takes a ritual meaning. The ritual is connected to the cosmic, and &quot;dharmani&quot; is equated to ceremonial devotion to the principles that deities used to create order from disorder, the world from chaos.

Past the ritual and cosmic sense of dharma that link the current world to mythical universe, the concept extends to an ethical-social sense that links human beings to each other and to other life forms. It is here that dharma as a concept of law emerges in Hinduism.

Dharma and related words are found in the oldest Vedic literature of Hinduism, in later Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and the Epics; the word dharma also plays a central role in the literature of other Indian religions founded later, such as Buddhism and Jainism. According to Brereton, &quot;Dharman&quot; occurs 63 times in Rig-veda; in addition, words related to Dharman also appear in Rig-veda, for example once as dharmakrt, 6 times as &quot;satyadharman&quot;, and once as &quot;dharmavant&quot;, 4 times as &quot;dharman&quot; and twice as &quot;dhariman&quot;.

Indo-European parallels for &quot;dharma&quot; are known, but the only Iranian equivalent is Old Persian &quot;darmān&quot;, meaning &quot;remedy&quot;. This meaning is different from the Indo-Aryan &quot;dhárman&quot;, suggesting that the word &quot;dharma&quot; did not play a major role in the Indo-Iranian period. Instead, it was primarily developed more recently under the Vedic tradition. 

It is thought that the &quot;Daena&quot; of Zoroastrianism, also meaning the &quot;eternal Law&quot; or &quot;religion&quot;, is related to Sanskrit &quot;dharma&quot;. Ideas in parts overlapping to &quot;Dharma&quot; are found in other ancient cultures: such as Chinese Tao, Egyptian Maat, Sumerian Me.

===Eusebeia and dharma===
In the mid-20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BCE was discovered in Afghanistan, the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription. This rock inscription contains Greek and Aramaic text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia.

Scholars of Hellenistic Greece explain eusebeia as a complex concept. Eusebia means not only to venerate deities, but also spiritual maturity, a reverential attitude toward life, and includes the right conduct toward one&#x27;s parents, siblings and children, the right conduct between husband and wife, and the conduct between biologically unrelated people. This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker, suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of right, of good, of one&#x27;s duty toward the human community.

===Rta, maya and dharma===
The evolving literature of Hinduism linked &quot;dharma&quot; to two other important concepts: &quot;Ṛta&quot; and &quot;Māyā&quot;. Ṛta in Vedas is the truth and cosmic principle which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. Māyā in Rig-veda and later literature means illusion, fraud, deception, magic that misleads and creates disorder, thus is contrary to reality, laws and rules that establish order, predictability and harmony. Paul Horsch suggests Ṛta and &quot;dharma&quot; are parallel concepts, the former being a cosmic principle, the latter being of moral social sphere; while Māyā and &quot;dharma&quot; are also correlative concepts, the former being that which corrupts law and moral life, the later being that which strengthens law and moral life.

Day proposes &quot;dharma&quot; is a manifestation of Ṛta, but suggests Ṛta may have been subsumed into a more complex concept of &quot;dharma&quot;, as the idea developed in ancient India over time in a nonlinear manner. The following verse from the Rigveda is an example where &quot;rta&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot; are linked:
==Hinduism==

&quot;Dharma&quot; is an organising principle in Hinduism that applies to human beings in solitude, in their interaction with human beings and nature, as well as between inanimate objects, to all of cosmos and its parts. It refers to the order and customs which make life and universe possible, and includes behaviours, rituals, rules that govern society, and ethics. Hindu &quot;dharma&quot; includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous. &quot;Dharma&quot;, according to Van Buitenen, is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is neither the act nor the result, but the natural laws that guide the act and create the result to prevent chaos in the world. It is innate characteristic, that makes the being what it is. It is, claims Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one&#x27;s nature and true calling, thus playing one&#x27;s role in cosmic concert. In Hinduism, it is the &quot;dharma&quot; of the bee to make honey, of cow to give milk, of sun to radiate sunshine, of river to flow. In terms of humanity, &quot;dharma&quot; is the need for, the effect of and essence of service and interconnectedness of all life. This includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and &quot;right way of living&quot;.

In its true essence, &quot;dharma&quot; means for a Hindu to &quot;expand the mind&quot;. Furthermore, it represents the direct connection between the individual and the societal phenomena that bind the society together. In the way societal phenomena affect the conscience of the individual, similarly may the actions of an individual alter the course of the society, for better or for worse. This has been subtly echoed by the credo धर्मो धारयति प्रजा: meaning &quot;dharma&quot; is that which holds and provides support to the social construct.

In Hinduism, &quot;dharma&quot; generally includes various aspects:
* Sanātana Dharma, the eternal and unchanging principals of &quot;dharma&quot;.
* Varṇ āśramā dharma, one&#x27;s duty at specific stages of life or inherent duties. 
* Svadharma, one&#x27;s own individual or personal duty.

===In Vedas and Upanishads===
The history section of this article discusses the development of &quot;dharma&quot; concept in Vedas. This development continued in the Upanishads and later ancient scripts of Hinduism. In Upanishads, the concept of &quot;dharma&quot; continues as universal principle of law, order, harmony, and truth. It acts as the regulatory moral principle of the Universe. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to &quot;satya&quot; (, truth), in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

=== Dharma and Mimamsa ===
&quot;Mimamsa&quot;, developed through commentaries on its foundational texts, particularly the &quot;Mimamsa Sutras&quot; attributed to Jaimini, emphasizes &quot;the desire to know dharma&quot; as the central concern, defining dharma as what connects a person with the highest good, always yet to be realized. While some schools associate dharma with post-mortem existence, &quot;Mimamsakas&quot; focus on the continual renewal and realization of a ritual world through adherence to Vedic injunctions. They assert that the ultimate good is essentially inaccessible to perception and can only be understood through language, reflecting confidence in Vedic injunctions and the reality of language as a means of knowing.

&quot;Mimamsa&quot; addresses the delayed results of actions (like wealth or heaven) through the concept of apurva or adrsta, an unseen force that preserves the connection between actions and their outcomes. This ensures that Vedic sacrifices, though their results are delayed, are effective and reliable in guiding toward dharma.

===In the Epics===
The Hindu religion and philosophy, claims Daniel Ingalls, places major emphasis on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent. In Hindu Epics, the good, morally upright, law-abiding king is referred to as &quot;dharmaraja&quot;.

&quot;Dharma&quot; is at the centre of all major events in the life of Dasharatha, Rama, Sita, and Lakshman in Ramayana. In the Ramayana, Dasharatha upholds his dharma by honoring a promise to Kaikeyi, resulting in his beloved son Rama&#x27;s exile, even though it brings him immense personal suffering. 

In the Mahabharata&quot;, dharma&quot; is central, and it is presented through symbolism and metaphors. Near the end of the epic, Yama referred to as &quot;dharma&quot; in the text, is portrayed as taking the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudhishthira, who is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal. Yudhishthira refuses to abandon his companion, for which he is then praised by &quot;dharma&quot;. The value and appeal of the Mahabharata, according to Ingalls, is not as much in its complex and rushed presentation of metaphysics in the 12th book. Indian metaphysics, he argues, is more eloquently presented in other Sanskrit scriptures. Instead, the appeal of Mahabharata, like Ramayana, lies in its presentation of a series of moral problems and life situations, where there are usually three answers: one answer is of Bhima, which represents brute force, an individual angle representing materialism, egoism, and self; the second answer is of Yudhishthira, which appeals to piety, deities, social virtue, and tradition; the third answer is of introspective Arjuna, which falls between the two extremes, and who, claims Ingalls, symbolically reveals the finest moral qualities of man. The Epics of Hinduism are a symbolic treatise about life, virtues, customs, morals, ethics, law, and other aspects of &quot;dharma&quot;. There is extensive discussion of &quot;dharma&quot; at the individual level in the Epics of Hinduism; for example, on free will versus destiny, when and why human beings believe in either, the strong and prosperous naturally uphold free will, while those facing grief or frustration naturally lean towards destiny. The Epics of Hinduism illustrate various aspects of &quot;dharma&quot; with metaphors.

===According to 4th-century Vatsyayana===
According to Klaus Klostermaier, 4th-century CE Hindu scholar Vātsyāyana explained &quot;dharma&quot; by contrasting it with adharma. Vātsyāyana suggested that &quot;dharma&quot; is not merely in one&#x27;s actions, but also in words one speaks or writes, and in thought. According to Vātsyāyana:

# Adharma of body: hinsa (violence), steya (steal, theft), pratisiddha maithuna (sexual indulgence with someone other than one&#x27;s partner)
# Dharma of body: dana (charity), paritrana (succor of the distressed) and paricarana (rendering service to others)
# Adharma from words one speaks or writes: mithya (falsehood), parusa (caustic talk), sucana (calumny) and asambaddha (absurd talk)
# Dharma from words one speaks or writes: satya (truth and facts), hitavacana (talking with good intention), priyavacana (gentle, kind talk), svadhyaya (self-study)
# Adharma of mind: paradroha (ill will to anyone), paradravyabhipsa (covetousness), nastikya (denial of the existence of morals and religiosity)
# Dharma of mind: daya (compassion), asprha (disinterestedness), and sraddha (faith in others)

===According to Patanjali Yoga===

In the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; of Patanjali the &quot;dharma&quot; is real; in the Vedanta it is unreal.
&quot;Dharma&quot; is part of yoga, suggests Patanjali; the elements of Hindu dharma are the attributes, qualities and aspects of yoga. Patanjali explained &quot;dharma&quot; in two categories: &quot;yamas&quot; (restraints) and &quot;niyamas&quot; (observances).

The five yamas, according to Patanjali, are: abstain from injury to all living creatures, abstain from falsehood (satya), abstain from unauthorised appropriation of things-of-value from another (acastrapurvaka), abstain from coveting or sexually cheating on your partner, and abstain from expecting or accepting gifts from others. The five yama apply in action, speech and mind. In explaining yama, Patanjali clarifies that certain professions and situations may require qualification in conduct. For example, a fisherman must injure a fish, but he must attempt to do this with least trauma to fish and the fisherman must try to injure no other creature as he fishes.

The five niyamas (observances) are cleanliness by eating pure food and removing impure thoughts (such as arrogance or jealousy or pride), contentment in one&#x27;s means, meditation and silent reflection regardless of circumstances one faces, study and pursuit of historic knowledge, and devotion of all actions to the Supreme Teacher to achieve perfection of concentration.

===Sources===
&quot;Dharma&quot; is an empirical and experiential inquiry for every man and woman, according to some texts of Hinduism. For example, Apastamba Dharmasutra states:

In other texts, three sources and means to discover &quot;dharma&quot; in Hinduism are described. These, according to Paul Hacker, are: First, learning historical knowledge such as Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics and other Sanskrit literature with the help of one&#x27;s teacher. Second, observing the behaviour and example of good people. The third source applies when neither one&#x27;s education nor example exemplary conduct is known. In this case, &quot;atmatusti&quot; is the source of &quot;dharma&quot; in Hinduism, that is the good person reflects and follows what satisfies his heart, his own inner feeling, what he feels driven to.

===Dharma, life stages and social stratification===

Some texts of Hinduism outline &quot;dharma&quot; for society and at the individual level. Of these, the most cited one is &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, which describes the four &quot;Varnas&quot;, their rights and duties. Most texts of Hinduism, however, discuss &quot;dharma&quot; with no mention of &quot;Varna&quot; (caste). Other &quot;dharma&quot; texts and Smritis differ from Manusmriti on the nature and structure of Varnas. Yet, other texts question the very existence of varna. Bhrigu, in the Epics, for example, presents the theory that &quot;dharma&quot; does not require any varnas. In practice, medieval India is widely believed to be a socially stratified society, with each social strata inheriting a profession and being endogamous. Varna was not absolute in Hindu dharma; individuals had the right to renounce and leave their Varna, as well as their asramas of life, in search of moksa. While neither Manusmriti nor succeeding Smritis of Hinduism ever use the word varnadharma (that is, the &quot;dharma&quot; of varnas), or varnasramadharma (that is, the &quot;dharma&quot; of varnas and asramas), the scholarly commentary on Manusmriti use these words, and thus associate &quot;dharma&quot; with varna system of India. In 6th century India, even Buddhist kings called themselves &quot;protectors of varnasramadharma&quot; – that is, &quot;dharma&quot; of varna and asramas of life.

At the individual level, some texts of Hinduism outline four āśramas, or stages of life as individual&#x27;s &quot;dharma&quot;. These are: (1) brahmacārya, the life of preparation as a student, (2) gṛhastha, the life of the householder with family and other social roles, (3) vānprastha or aranyaka, the life of the forest-dweller, transitioning from worldly occupations to reflection and renunciation, and (4) sannyāsa, the life of giving away all property, becoming a recluse and devotion to moksa, spiritual matters. Patrick Olivelle suggests that &quot;ashramas represented life choices rather than sequential steps in the life of a single individual&quot; and the vanaprastha stage was added before renunciation over time, thus forming life stages.

The four stages of life complete the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism. &quot;Dharma&quot; enables the individual to satisfy the striving for stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving to do the right thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are Artha – the striving for means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, and so forth; Kama – the striving for sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfilment, and so forth; and Moksa – the striving for spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, and so forth. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu &quot;dharma&quot;.

===Dharma and poverty===
&quot;Dharma&quot; being necessary for individual and society, is dependent on poverty and prosperity in a society, according to Hindu dharma scriptures. For example, according to Adam Bowles, Shatapatha Brahmana 11.1.6.24 links social prosperity and &quot;dharma&quot; through water. Waters come from rains, it claims; when rains are abundant there is prosperity on the earth, and this prosperity enables people to follow &quot;Dharma&quot; – moral and lawful life. In times of distress, of drought, of poverty, everything suffers including relations between human beings and the human ability to live according to &quot;dharma&quot;.

In Rajadharmaparvan 91.34-8, the relationship between poverty and &quot;dharma&quot; reaches a full circle. A land with less moral and lawful life suffers distress, and as distress rises it causes more immoral and unlawful life, which further increases distress. Those in power must follow the raja dharma (that is, dharma of rulers), because this enables the society and the individual to follow dharma and achieve prosperity.

===Dharma and law===

The notion of &quot;dharma&quot; as duty or propriety is found in India&#x27;s ancient legal and religious texts. Common examples of such use are pitri dharma (meaning a person&#x27;s duty as a father), putra dharma (a person&#x27;s duty as a son), raj dharma (a person&#x27;s duty as a king) and so forth. In Hindu philosophy, justice, social harmony, and happiness requires that people live per &quot;dharma&quot;. The Dharmashastra is a record of these guidelines and rules. The available evidence suggest India once had a large collection of &quot;dharma&quot; related literature (sutras, shastras); four of the sutras survive and these are now referred to as Dharmasutras. Along with laws of Manu in Dharmasutras, exist parallel and different compendium of laws, such as the laws of Narada and other ancient scholars. These different and conflicting law books are neither exclusive, nor do they supersede other sources of &quot;dharma&quot; in Hinduism. These Dharmasutras include instructions on education of the young, their rites of passage, customs, religious rites and rituals, marital rights and obligations, death and ancestral rites, laws and administration of justice, crimes, punishments, rules and types of evidence, duties of a king, as well as morality.

==Buddhism==

Buddhism held the Hindu view of &quot;Dharma&quot; as &quot;cosmic law&quot;, as in the working of Karma. The term Dharma () later came to refer to the teachings of the Buddha (&quot;pariyatti&quot;); the practice (&quot;paṭipatti&quot;) of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings is then comprehended as Dharma. In Buddhist philosophy, &quot;dhamma/dharma&quot; is also the term for &quot;phenomena&quot;.

===Buddha&#x27;s teachings===

For practising Buddhists, references to &quot;dharma&quot; (&quot;dhamma&quot; in Pali) particularly as &quot;the dharma&quot;, generally means the teachings of the Buddha, commonly known throughout the East as Buddhadharma. It includes especially the discourses on the fundamental principles (such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path), as opposed to the parables and to the poems. The Buddha&#x27;s teachings explain that in order to end suffering, &quot;dharma&quot;, or the right thoughts, understanding, actions and livelihood, should be cultivated.

The status of &quot;dharma&quot; is regarded variably by different Buddhist traditions. Some regard it as an ultimate truth, or as the fount of all things which lie beyond the &quot;three realms&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;tridhatu&quot;) and the &quot;wheel of becoming&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;bhavachakra&quot;). Others, who regard the Buddha as simply an enlightened human being, see the &quot;dharma&quot; as the essence of the &quot;84,000 different aspects of the teaching&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;chos-sgo brgyad-khri bzhi strong&quot;) that the Buddha gave to various types of people, based upon their individual propensities and capabilities.

Dharma refers not only to the sayings of the Buddha, but also to the later traditions of interpretation and addition that the various schools of Buddhism have developed to help explain and to expand upon the Buddha&#x27;s teachings. For others still, they see the &quot;dharma&quot; as referring to the &quot;truth&quot;, or the ultimate reality of &quot;the way that things really are&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;Chö&quot;).

The &quot;dharma&quot; is one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism in which practitioners of Buddhism seek refuge, or that upon which one relies for his or her lasting happiness. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the Buddha, meaning the mind&#x27;s perfection of enlightenment, the &quot;dharma&quot;, meaning the teachings and the methods of the Buddha, and the Sangha, meaning the community of practitioners who provide one another guidance and support.

===Chan Buddhism===
Dharma is employed in Chan Buddhism in a specific context in relation to transmission of authentic doctrine, understanding and bodhi; recognised in dharma transmission.

===Theravada Buddhism===
In Theravada Buddhism obtaining ultimate realisation of the dhamma is achieved in three phases; learning, practising and realising.

In Pali:
#Pariyatti – the learning of the theory of &quot;dharma&quot; as contained within the suttas of the Pali canon
#Patipatti – putting the theory into practice and 
#Pativedha – when one penetrates the &quot;dharma&quot; or through experience realises the truth of it.

==Jainism==
The word &quot;dharma&quot; in Jainism is found in all its key texts. It has a contextual meaning and refers to a number of ideas. In the broadest sense, it means the teachings of the Jinas, or teachings of any competing spiritual school, a supreme path, socio-religious duty, and that which is the highest (holy).

The &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot;, a major Jain text, mentions () with referring to ten righteous virtues: forbearance, modesty, straightforwardness, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation, non-attachment, and celibacy. , author of the Jain text, writes:
===&quot;Dharmāstikāya&quot;===

The term () also has a specific ontological and soteriological meaning in Jainism, as a part of its theory of six (substance or a reality). In the Jain tradition, existence consists of (soul, ) and (non-soul, ), the latter consisting of five categories: inert non-sentient atomic matter (), space (), time (), principle of motion (), and principle of rest (). The use of the term to mean motion and to refer to an ontological sub-category is peculiar to Jainism, and not found in the metaphysics of Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism.

==Sikhism==
For Sikhs, the word &quot;dharam&quot; () means the path of righteousness and proper religious practice. Guru Granth Sahib connotes &quot;dharma&quot; as duty and moral values. The 3HO movement in Western culture, which has incorporated certain Sikh beliefs, defines Sikh Dharma broadly as all that constitutes religion, moral duty and way of life.

==In Sangam literature==

Several works of the Sangam and post-Sangam period, many of which are of Hindu or Jain origin, emphasizes on &quot;dharma&quot;. Most of these texts are based on &quot;aṟam&quot;, the Tamil term for &quot;dharma&quot;. The ancient Tamil moral text of the &quot;Tirukkuṟaḷ&quot; or &quot;Kural&quot;, a text probably of Jain or Hindu origin, despite being a collection of aphoristic teachings on &quot;dharma&quot; (&quot;aram&quot;), artha (&quot;porul&quot;), and kama (&quot;inpam&quot;), is completely and exclusively based on &quot;aṟam&quot;. The Naladiyar, a Jain text of the post-Sangam period, follows a similar pattern as that of the Kural in emphasizing &quot;aṟam&quot; or &quot;dharma&quot;.

==Dharma in symbols==

The importance of &quot;dharma&quot; to Indian civilization is illustrated by India&#x27;s decision in 1947 to include the Ashoka Chakra, a depiction of the &quot;dharmachakra&quot; (the &quot;wheel of &quot;dharma&quot;&quot;), as the central motif on its flag.

<text>Daniel Clement Dennett III (March 28, 1942 – April 19, 2024) was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist. His research centered on the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of biology, particularly as those fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science.

Dennett was the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies and the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Dennett was a member of the editorial board for &quot;The Rutherford Journal&quot; and a co-founder of The Clergy Project.

A vocal atheist and secularist, Dennett has been described as &quot;one of the most widely read and debated American philosophers&quot;. He was referred to as one of the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; of New Atheism, along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens.

==Early life and education==

Daniel Clement Dennett III was born on March 28, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck; 1903–1971) and Daniel Clement Dennett Jr. (1910–1947). 

Dennett spent part of his childhood in Lebanon, where, during World War II, his father, who had a PhD in Islamic studies from Harvard University, was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attaché to the American Embassy in Beirut. His mother, an English major at Carleton College, went for a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Minnesota before becoming an English teacher at the American Community School in Beirut. In 1947, his father was killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. Shortly after, his mother took him back to Massachusetts. Dennett&#x27;s sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. 

Dennett said that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending Camp Mowglis in Hebron, New Hampshire, at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, &quot;You know what you are, Daniel? You&#x27;re a philosopher.&quot;

Dennett graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1959, and spent one year at Wesleyan University before receiving his BA degree in philosophy at Harvard University in 1963. There, he was a student of Willard Van Orman Quine. He had decided to transfer to Harvard after reading Quine&#x27;s &quot;From a Logical Point of View&quot; and, thinking that Quine was wrong about some things, decided, as he said &quot;as only a freshman could, that I had to go to Harvard and confront this man with my corrections to his errors!&quot;

==Academic career==
In 1965, Dennett received his DPhil in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he studied under Gilbert Ryle and was a member of Hertford College. His doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality&quot;.

From 1965 to 1971, Dennett taught at the University of California, Irvine, before moving to Tufts University where he taught for many decades. He also spent periods visiting at Harvard University and several other universities. Dennett described himself as &quot;an autodidact—or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world&#x27;s leading scientists&quot;.

Throughout his career, he was an interdisciplinarian who argued for &quot;breaking the silos of knowledge&quot;, and he collaborated widely with computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and biologists.

Dennett was the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship and two Guggenheim Fellowships.

==Philosophical views==

===Free will vs Determinism===
While he was a confirmed compatibilist on free will, in &quot;On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want&quot;—chapter 15 of his 1978 book &quot;Brainstorms&quot;—Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to libertarian views.

While other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including William James, Henri Poincaré, Arthur Compton, and Henry Margenau, Dennett defended this model for the following reasons:

Leading libertarian philosophers such as Robert Kane have rejected Dennett&#x27;s model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent&#x27;s motives and reasons, character and values, and feelings and desires. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:


===Mind===

Dennett is a proponent of materialism in the philosophy of mind. He argues that mental states, including consciousness, are entirely the result of physical processes in the brain. In his book &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; (1991), Dennett presents his arguments for a materialist understanding of consciousness, rejecting Cartesian dualism in favor of a physicalist perspective.

Dennett remarked in several places (such as &quot;Self-portrait&quot;, in &quot;Brainchildren&quot;) that his overall philosophical project remained largely the same from his time at Oxford onwards. He was primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in empirical research. In his original dissertation, &quot;Content and Consciousness&quot;, he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project also stayed true to this distinction. Just as &quot;Content and Consciousness&quot; has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided &quot;Brainstorms&quot; into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in &quot;The Intentional Stance&quot; and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.

In chapter 5 of &quot;Consciousness Explained,&quot; Dennett described his multiple drafts model of consciousness. He stated that, &quot;all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous &#x27;editorial revision.&#x27;&quot; (p. 111). Later he asserts, &quot;These yield, over the course of time, something &quot;rather like&quot; a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...&quot; (p. 135, emphasis in the original).

In this work, Dennett&#x27;s interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this later became an integral part of his program. He stated his view is materialist and scientific, and he presents an argument against qualia; he argued that the concept of qualia is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism.

This view is rejected by neuroscientists Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, and Rodolfo Llinás, all of whom state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.

Dennett&#x27;s strategy mirrored his teacher Ryle&#x27;s approach of redefining first-person phenomena in third-person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.

Dennett self-identified with a few terms:
In &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, he affirmed &quot;I am a sort of &#x27;teleofunctionalist&#x27;, of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of verificationist.&quot; (pp. 460–61).

Dennett was credited with inspiring false belief tasks used in developmental psychology. He noted that when four-year-olds watch the Punch and Judy puppet show, they laugh because they know that they know more about what&#x27;s going on than one of the characters does:

===Evolutionary debate===
Much of Dennett&#x27;s work from the 1990s onwards was concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (&quot;Kinds of Minds&quot;), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot;).

Dennett saw evolution by natural selection as an algorithmic process (though he spelt out that algorithms as simple as long division often incorporate a significant degree of randomness). This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who preferred to stress the &quot;pluralism&quot; of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).

Dennett&#x27;s views on evolution are identified as being strongly adaptationist, in line with his theory of the intentional stance, and the evolutionary views of biologist Richard Dawkins. In &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould&#x27;s long-running public debate with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology, which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker. Gould argued that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould&#x27;s, to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett&#x27;s &quot;Darwinian fundamentalism&quot;.

Dennett&#x27;s theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller.

===Religion and morality===
Dennett was a vocal atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board, and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. Dennett was referred to as one of the &quot;Four Horsemen of New Atheism&quot;, along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.
In &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, Dennett wrote that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejected the idea that morality being natural to us implies that we should take a skeptical position regarding ethics, noting that what is fallacious in the naturalistic fallacy is not to support values per se, but rather to &quot;rush&quot; from facts to values.

In his 2006 book, &quot;Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon&quot;, Dennett attempted to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence. In this book he declared himself to be &quot;a bright&quot;, and defended the term.

He did research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. This made unbelieving preachers feel isolated, but they did not want to lose their jobs and church-supplied lodgings. Generally, they consoled themselves with the belief that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, &quot;Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind&quot;.

===Memetics, postmodernism and deepity===
Dennett wrote about and advocated the notion of memetics as a philosophically useful tool, his last work on this topic being his &quot;Brains, Computers, and Minds&quot;, a three-part presentation through Harvard&#x27;s MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.

Dennett was critical of postmodernism, having said: 

Dennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term &quot;deepity&quot;, originally coined by Miriam Weizenbaum. Dennett used &quot;deepity&quot; for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are &quot;Que será será!&quot;, &quot;Beauty is only skin deep!&quot;, &quot;The power of intention can transform your life.&quot; The term many times.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
While approving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett saw a danger in machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to anthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that they do not possess. He believed the relevant danger from artificial intelligence (AI) is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically &quot;parasitic&quot; AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user&#x27;s powers of comprehension.

In the 1990s, Dennett collaborated with a group of computer scientists at MIT to attempt to develop a humanoid, conscious robot, named &quot;Cog&quot;. The project did not produce a conscious robot, but Dennett argued that in principle it could have.

As given in his penultimate book, &quot;From Bacteria to Bach and Back&quot;, Dennett&#x27;s views were contrary to those of Nick Bostrom. Although acknowledging that it is &quot;possible in principle&quot; to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintained that the difficulties of any such &quot;strong AI&quot; project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized. Dennett believed, as of the book&#x27;s publication in 2017, that the prospect of superintelligence (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) was at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.

=== Realism ===
Dennett was known for his nuanced stance on realism. While he supported scientific realism, advocating that entities and phenomena posited by scientific theories exist independently of our perceptions, he leant towards instrumentalism concerning certain theoretical entities, valuing their explanatory and predictive utility, as showing in his discussion of real patterns. Dennett&#x27;s pragmatic realism underlines the entanglement of language, consciousness, and reality. He posited that our discourse about reality is mediated by our cognitive and linguistic capacities, marking a departure from Naïve realism.

Dennett&#x27;s philosophical stance on realism was intricately connected to his views on instrumentalism and the theory of real patterns. He drew a distinction between illata, which are genuine theoretical entities like electrons, and abstracta, which are &quot;calculation bound entities or logical constructs&quot; such as centers of gravity and the equator, placing beliefs and the like among the latter. One of Dennett&#x27;s principal arguments was an instrumentalistic construal of intentional attributions, asserting that such attributions are environment-relative.

In discussing intentional states, Dennett posited that they should not be thought of as resembling theoretical entities, but rather as logical constructs, avoiding the pitfalls of intentional realism without lapsing into pure instrumentalism or even eliminativism. His instrumentalism and anti-realism were crucial aspects of his view on intentionality, emphasizing the centrality and indispensability of the intentional stance to our conceptual scheme.

==Recognition==
Dennett was the recipient of a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He was a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. In 2006, Dennett received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2009.

In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In 2012, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize, an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, &quot;for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience&quot;. In 2018, he was awarded an honorary doctorate (Dr.h.c.) by the Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Dennett married Susan Bell. They lived in North Andover, Massachusetts, and had a daughter, a son, and six grandchildren. He was an avid sailor who loved sailing &quot;Xanthippe&quot;, his 13-meter sailboat. He also played many musical instruments and sang at glee clubs.

Dennett died of interstitial lung disease at Maine Medical Center on April 19, 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life is a 1995 book by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which the author looks at some of the repercussions of Darwinian theory. The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin&#x27;s theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. Dennett makes this case on the basis that natural selection is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the evolution of life. Darwin&#x27;s discovery was that the generation of life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a way that given these processes the results that they tend toward must be so.

Dennett says, for example, that by claiming that minds cannot be reduced to purely algorithmic processes, many of his eminent contemporaries are claiming that miracles can occur. These assertions have generated a great deal of debate and discussion in the general public. The book was a finalist for the 1995 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.

==Background==

Dennett&#x27;s previous book was &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; (1991). Dennett noted discomfort with Darwinism among not only lay people but also even academics and decided it was time to write a book dealing with the subject. &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; is not meant to be a work of science, but rather an interdisciplinary book; Dennett admits that he does not understand all of the scientific details himself. He goes into a moderate level of detail, but leaves it for the reader to go into greater depth if desired, providing references to this end.

In writing the book, Dennett wanted to &quot;get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary theory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens&quot;. To do this he tells a story; one that is mainly original but includes some material from his previous work.

Dennett taught an undergraduate seminar at Tufts University on Darwin and philosophy, which included most of the ideas in the book. He also had the help of fellow staff and other academics, some of whom read drafts of the book. It is dedicated to W. V. O. Quine, &quot;teacher and friend&quot;.

==Synopsis==

===Part I: Starting in the Middle===
&quot;Starting in the Middle&quot;, Part I of &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, gets its name from a quote by Willard Van Orman Quine: &quot;Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle. Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distance objects, and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race.&quot;

The first chapter &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is named after a song.

Before Charles Darwin, and still today, a majority of people see God as the ultimate cause of all design, or the ultimate answer to &#x27;why?&#x27; questions. John Locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter, and David Hume, while exposing problems with Locke&#x27;s view, could not see any alternative.
Darwin provided just such an alternative: evolution. Besides providing evidence of common descent, he introduced a mechanism to explain it: natural selection. According to Dennett, natural selection is a mindless, mechanical and algorithmic process—Darwin&#x27;s dangerous idea. The third chapter introduces the concept of &quot;skyhooks&quot; and &quot;cranes&quot; (see below). He suggests that resistance to Darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks, which do not really exist. According to Dennett, good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks; greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes.

Chapter 4 looks at the tree of life, such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in life&#x27;s history. The next chapter concerns the possible and the actual, using the &#x27;Library of Mendel&#x27; (the space of all logically possible genomes) as a conceptual aid.

In the last chapter of part I, Dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified Design Space. Descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently. However, there are also &quot;Forced Moves&quot; or &quot;Good Tricks&quot; that will be discovered repeatedly, either by natural selection (see convergent evolution) or human investigation.

===Part II: Darwinian Thinking in Biology===

The first chapter of part II, &quot;Darwinian Thinking in Biology&quot;, asserts that life originated without any skyhooks, and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos.

The eighth chapter&#x27;s message is conveyed by its title, &quot;Biology is Engineering&quot;; biology is the study of design, function, construction and operation. However, there are some important differences between biology and engineering. Related to the engineering concept of optimization, the next chapter deals with adaptationism, which Dennett endorses, calling Gould and Lewontin&#x27;s &quot;refutation&quot; of it an illusion. Dennett thinks adaptationism is, in fact, the best way of uncovering constraints.

The tenth chapter, entitled &quot;Bully for Brontosaurus&quot;, is an extended critique of Stephen Jay Gould, who Dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings; his &quot;self-styled revolutions&quot; against adaptationism, gradualism and other orthodox Darwinism all being false alarms. The final chapter of part II dismisses directed mutation, the inheritance of acquired traits and Teilhard&#x27;s &quot;Omega Point&quot;, and insists that other controversies and hypotheses (like the unit of selection and Panspermia) have no dire consequences for orthodox Darwinism.

===Part III: Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality===

&quot;Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality&quot; is the name of Part III, which begins with a quote from Nietzsche. Chapter 12, &quot;The Cranes of Culture&quot;, discusses cultural evolution. It asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture, and that it allows humans, alone among animals, to &quot;transcend&quot; our selfish genes. &quot;Losing Our Minds to Darwin&quot; follows, a chapter about the evolution of brains, minds and language. Dennett criticizes Noam Chomsky&#x27;s perceived resistance to the evolution of language, its modeling by artificial intelligence, and reverse engineering.

The evolution of meaning is then discussed, and Dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless, algorithmic processes.
Chapter 15 asserts that Gödel&#x27;s Theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible. Dennett extends his criticism to Roger Penrose. The subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality, beginning with Thomas Hobbes (who Dennett calls &quot;the first sociobiologist&quot;) and Friedrich Nietzsche. He concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense, though he cautions against some varieties of &#x27;greedy ethical reductionism&#x27;. Before moving to the next chapter, he discusses some sociobiology controversies.

The penultimate chapter, entitled &quot;Redesigning Morality&quot;, begins by asking if ethics can be &#x27;naturalized&#x27;. Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing, but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems. In &quot;The Future of an Idea&quot;, the book&#x27;s last chapter, Dennett praises biodiversity, including cultural diversity. In closing, he uses &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as an analogy; although Darwin&#x27;s idea may seem dangerous, it is actually quite beautiful.

== Central concepts ==

=== Design Space ===
Dennett believes there is little or no principled difference between the naturally generated products of evolution and the man-made artifacts of human creativity and culture. For this reason he indicates deliberately that the complex fruits of the tree of life are in a very meaningful sense &quot;designed&quot;—even though he does not believe evolution was guided by a higher intelligence.

Dennett supports using the notion of memes to better understand cultural evolution. He also believes even human creativity might operate by the Darwinian mechanism. This leads him to propose that the &quot;space&quot; describing biological &quot;design&quot; is connected with the space describing human culture and technology.

A precise mathematical definition of Design Space is not given in &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;. Dennett acknowledges this and admits he is offering a philosophical idea rather than a scientific formulation.

=== Natural selection as an algorithm ===
Dennett describes natural selection as a substrate-neutral, mindless algorithm for moving through Design Space.

=== Universal acid ===
Dennett writes about the fantasy of a &quot;universal acid&quot; as a liquid that is so corrosive that it would eat through anything that it came into contact with, even a potential container. Such a powerful substance would transform everything it was applied to; leaving something very different in its wake. This is where Dennett draws parallels from the “universal acid” to Darwin&#x27;s idea:

it eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognizable, but transformed in fundamental ways.

While there are people who would like to see Darwin&#x27;s idea contained within the field of biology, Dennett asserts that this dangerous idea inevitably “leaks” out to transform other fields as well.

===Skyhooks and cranes===
Dennett uses the term &quot;skyhook&quot; to describe a source of design complexity that does not build on lower, simpler layers—in simple terms, a miracle.

In philosophical arguments concerning the reducibility (or otherwise) of the human mind, Dennett&#x27;s concept pokes fun at the idea of intelligent design emanating from on high, either originating from one or more gods, or providing its own grounds in an absurd, Munchausen-like bootstrapping manner.

Dennett also accuses various competing neo-Darwinian ideas of making use of such supposedly unscientific skyhooks in explaining evolution, coming down particularly hard on the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould.

Dennett contrasts theories of complexity that require such miracles with those based on &quot;cranes&quot;, structures that permit the construction of entities of greater complexity but are themselves founded solidly &quot;on the ground&quot; of physical science.

== Reception ==
In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, John Maynard Smith praised &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;:
It is therefore a pleasure to meet a philosopher who understands what Darwinism is about, and approves of it.
Dennett goes well beyond biology. He sees Darwinism as a corrosive acid, capable of dissolving our earlier belief and forcing a reconsideration of much of sociology and philosophy. Although modestly written, this is not a modest book. Dennett argues that, if we understand &quot;Darwin&#x27;s dangerous idea&quot;, we are forced to reject or modify much of our current intellectual baggage...
Writing in the same publication, Stephen Jay Gould criticised &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; for being an &quot;influential but misguided ultra-Darwinian manifesto&quot;:

Daniel Dennett devotes the longest chapter in &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; to an excoriating caricature of my ideas, all in order to bolster his defense of Darwinian fundamentalism. If an argued case can be discerned at all amid the slurs and sneers, it would have to be described as an effort to claim that I have, thanks to some literary skill, tried to raise a few piddling, insignificant, and basically conventional ideas to &quot;revolutionary&quot; status, challenging what he takes to be the true Darwinian scripture. Since Dennett shows so little understanding of evolutionary theory beyond natural selection, his critique of my work amounts to little more than sniping at false targets of his own construction. He never deals with my ideas as such, but proceeds by hint, innuendo, false attribution, and error.

Gould was also a harsh critic of Dennett&#x27;s idea of the &quot;universal acid&quot; of natural selection and of his subscription to the idea of memetics; Dennett responded, and the exchange between Dennett, Gould, and Robert Wright was printed in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;.

Biologist H. Allen Orr wrote a critical review emphasizing similar points in the &quot;Boston Review&quot;.

The book has also provoked a negative reaction from creationists; Frederick Crews writes that &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; &quot;rivals Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; as the creationists&#x27; most cordially hated text.&quot;

<text>Douglas Richard Hofstadter (born February 15, 1945) is an American cognitive and computer scientist whose research includes concepts such as the sense of self in relation to the external world, consciousness, analogy-making, strange loops, artificial intelligence, and discovery in mathematics and physics. His 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction, and a National Book Award (at that time called The American Book Award) for Science. His 2007 book &quot;I Am a Strange Loop&quot; won the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Science and Technology.

== Early life and education ==
Hofstadter was born in New York City to future Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter and Nancy Givan Hofstadter. He grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor, and attended the International School of Geneva in 1958–59. He graduated with distinction in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as Hofstadter&#x27;s butterfly.

== Academic career ==
Hofstadter was initially appointed to Indiana University&#x27;s computer science department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which he called &quot;artificial intelligence research&quot;, a label he has since dropped in favor of &quot;cognitive science research&quot;). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding.

In 1988, Hofstadter returned to IU as College of Arts and Sciences Professor in cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal. 

Since 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition, which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the &quot;Fluid Analogies Research Group&quot; (FARG). In 1988, he received the &quot;In Praise of Reason&quot; award, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&#x27;s highest honor. In 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and became a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 2010, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.

==Work and publications==
At the University of Michigan and Indiana University, Hofstadter and Melanie Mitchell coauthored a computational model of &quot;high-level perception&quot;—Copycat—and several other models of analogy-making and cognition, including the Tabletop project, co-developed with Robert M. French. The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform &quot;gridfonts&quot; (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.

Hofstadter&#x27;s thesis about consciousness, first expressed in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; but also present in several of his later books, is that it is &quot;an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain.&quot; In &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent &quot;colony&quot; of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an &quot;I&quot; comes from the abstract pattern he terms a &quot;strange loop&quot;, an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and video feedback that Hofstadter has defined as &quot;a level-crossing feedback loop&quot;. The prototypical example of a strange loop is the self-referential structure at the core of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;I Am a Strange Loop&quot; carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human &quot;I&quot; is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to one. Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of 88 translations of &quot;Ma Mignonne&quot;, a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet Clément Marot. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as &quot;pilingual&quot; (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he has studied comes to 3.14159 ...), as well as an &quot;oligoglot&quot; (someone who speaks &quot;a few&quot; languages).

In 1999, the bicentennial year of the Russian poet and writer Alexander Pushkin, Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin&#x27;s classic novel-in-verse &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. He has translated other poems and two novels: &quot;La Chamade&quot; (&quot;That Mad Ache&quot;) by Françoise Sagan, and &quot;La Scoperta dell&#x27;Alba&quot; (&quot;The Discovery of Dawn&quot;) by Walter Veltroni, the then-head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. &quot;The Discovery of Dawn&quot; was published in 2007, and &quot;That Mad Ache&quot; was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter&#x27;s essay &quot;Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation&quot;.

=== Hofstadter&#x27;s Law ===

Hofstadter&#x27;s Law is &quot;It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#x27;s Law.&quot; The law is stated in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;.

=== Students ===
Hofstadter&#x27;s former Ph.D. students include (with dissertation title):

*David ChalmersToward a Theory of Consciousness
*Bob FrenchTabletop: An Emergent, Stochastic Model of Analogy-Making
*Gary McGrawLetter Spirit (Part One): Emergent High-level Perception of Letters Using Fluid Concepts
*Melanie MitchellCopycat: A Computer Model of High-Level Perception and Conceptual Slippage in Analogy-making

== Public image ==

Hofstadter has said that he feels &quot;uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers&quot;. He admits that &quot;a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology&quot;, but when it was suggested that his work &quot;has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence&quot; he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has &quot;no interest in computers&quot;. In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a &quot;skeptical look at a number of highly touted AI projects and overall approaches&quot;. For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented: &quot;It was a watershed event, but it doesn&#x27;t have to do with computers becoming intelligent.&quot; In his book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;, he says that &quot;in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?&quot;

In 1988, Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, &quot;Victim of the Brain&quot;, based on &quot;The Mind&#x27;s I&quot;. It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.

Provoked by predictions of a technological singularity (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium titled &quot;Spiritual Robots&quot; at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, Kevin Kelly, Ralph Merkle, Bill Joy, Frank Drake, John Holland and John Koza. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first Singularity Summit, held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt that the singularity will occur in the foreseeable future.

In an interview in 2023 Hofstadter said that rapid progress in AI made some of his &quot;core beliefs&quot; about the limitations of AI &quot;collapse&quot;. Hinting at an AI takeover, he added that human beings may soon be eclipsed by &quot;something else that is far more intelligent and will become incomprehensible to us&quot;.

== Columnist ==
When Martin Gardner retired from writing his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column for &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981–83 with a column titled &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of &quot;Reviews of This Book&quot;, a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself that has an online implementation. One of Hofstadter&#x27;s columns in &quot;Scientific American&quot; concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire, &quot;A Person Paper on Purity in Language&quot; (1985), in which the reader&#x27;s presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to William Safire. Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod in his computer tournament pitting many iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student Marek Lugowski organized. The &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; columns ranged over many themes, including patterns in Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s piano music (particularly his études), the concept of superrationality (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and the self-modifying game of Nomic, based on the way the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher Peter Suber.

== Personal life ==
Hofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children. Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, when their children were young. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name. Hofstadter&#x27;s book &quot;Le Ton beau de Marot&quot; is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads &quot;To M. &amp; D., living sparks of their Mommy&#x27;s soul&quot;. In 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a cha-cha-cha class, and they married in Bloomington in September 2012.

Hofstadter has composed pieces for piano and for piano and voice. He created an audio CD, &quot;DRH/JJ&quot;, of these compositions performed mostly by pianist Jane Jackson, with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur, and Hofstadter. The dedication for &quot;I Am A Strange Loop&quot; is: &quot;To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot.&quot; Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language. As a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter became a vegetarian in his teenage years, and has remained primarily so since that time.

==In popular culture==
In the 1982 novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;, Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s first sequel to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, HAL 9000 is described by the character &quot;Dr. Chandra&quot; as being caught in a &quot;Hofstadter–Möbius loop&quot;. The movie uses the term &quot;H. Möbius loop&quot;. On April 3, 1995, Hofstadter&#x27;s book &quot;Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought&quot; was the first book sold by Amazon.com. Michael R. Jackson&#x27;s musical &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; makes reference to Hofstadter&#x27;s concept and the title of his 2007 book.
