<text>Common Lisp (CL) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard document &quot;ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (S2018)&quot; (formerly &quot;X3.226-1994 (R1999)&quot;). The Common Lisp HyperSpec, a hyperlinked HTML version, has been derived from the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

The Common Lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp. By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products.
Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. As a dynamic programming language, it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development, with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application.

It also supports optional type annotation and casting, which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages, to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code. For instance, codice_1 can hold an unboxed integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation, permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types. Similarly, the compiler can be told on a per-module or per-function basis which type of safety level is wanted, using &quot;optimize&quot; declarations.

Common Lisp includes CLOS, an object system that supports multimethods and method combinations. It is often implemented with a Metaobject Protocol.

Common Lisp is extensible through standard features such as &quot;Lisp macros&quot; (code transformations) and &quot;reader macros&quot; (input parsers for characters).

Common Lisp provides partial backwards compatibility with Maclisp and John McCarthy&#x27;s original Lisp. This allows older Lisp software to be ported to Common Lisp.

==History==

Work on Common Lisp started in 1981 after an initiative by ARPA manager Bob Engelmore to develop a single community standard Lisp dialect. Much of the initial language design was done via electronic mail. In 1982, Guy L. Steele Jr. gave the first overview of Common Lisp at the 1982 ACM Symposium on LISP and functional programming.

The first language documentation was published in 1984 as Common Lisp the Language (known as CLtL1), first edition. A second edition (known as CLtL2), published in 1990, incorporated many changes to the language, made during the ANSI Common Lisp standardization process: extended LOOP syntax, the Common Lisp Object System, the Condition System for error handling, an interface to the pretty printer and much more. But CLtL2 does not describe the final ANSI Common Lisp standard and thus is not a documentation of ANSI Common Lisp. The final ANSI Common Lisp standard then was published in 1994. Since then no update to the standard has been published. Various extensions and improvements to Common Lisp (examples are Unicode, Concurrency, CLOS-based IO) have been provided by implementations and libraries.

==Syntax==
Common Lisp is a dialect of Lisp. It uses S-expressions to denote both code and data structure. Function calls, macro forms and special forms are written as lists, with the name of the operator first, as in these examples:
 (+ 2 2) ; adds 2 and 2, yielding 4. The function&#x27;s name is &#x27;+&#x27;. Lisp has no operators as such.
 (defvar *x*) ; Ensures that a variable *x* exists,
 ; without giving it a value. The asterisks are part of
 ; the name, by convention denoting a special (global) variable. 
 ; The symbol *x* is also hereby endowed with the property that
 ; subsequent bindings of it are dynamic, rather than lexical.
 (setf *x* 42.1) ; Sets the variable *x* to the floating-point value 42.1
 ;; Define a function that squares a number:
 (defun square (x)
 (* x x))
 ;; Execute the function:
 (square 3) ; Returns 9

 ;; The &#x27;let&#x27; construct creates a scope for local variables. Here
 ;; the variable &#x27;a&#x27; is bound to 6 and the variable &#x27;b&#x27; is bound
 ;; to 4. Inside the &#x27;let&#x27; is a &#x27;body&#x27;, where the last computed value is returned.
 ;; Here the result of adding a and b is returned from the &#x27;let&#x27; expression.
 ;; The variables a and b have lexical scope, unless the symbols have been
 ;; marked as special variables (for instance by a prior DEFVAR).
 (let ((a 6)
 (b 4))
 (+ a b)) ; returns 10
==Data types==
Common Lisp has many data types.

===Scalar types===
&quot;Number&quot; types include integers, ratios, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Common Lisp uses bignums to represent numerical values of arbitrary size and precision. The ratio type represents fractions exactly, a facility not available in many languages. Common Lisp automatically coerces numeric values among these types as appropriate.

The Common Lisp &quot;character&quot; type is not limited to ASCII characters. Most modern implementations allow Unicode characters.

The &quot;symbol&quot; type is common to Lisp languages, but largely unknown outside them. A symbol is a unique, named data object with several parts: name, value, function, property list, and package. Of these, &quot;value cell&quot; and &quot;function cell&quot; are the most important. Symbols in Lisp are often used similarly to identifiers in other languages: to hold the value of a variable; however there are many other uses. Normally, when a symbol is evaluated, its value is returned. Some symbols evaluate to themselves, for example, all symbols in the keyword package are self-evaluating. Boolean values in Common Lisp are represented by the self-evaluating symbols T and NIL. Common Lisp has namespaces for symbols, called &#x27;packages&#x27;.

A number of functions are available for rounding scalar numeric values in various ways. The function codice_2 rounds the argument to the nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded to the even integer. The functions codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 round towards zero, down, or up respectively. All these functions return the discarded fractional part as a secondary value. For example, codice_6 yields −3, 0.5; codice_7 yields −2, −0.5; codice_8 yields 2, 0.5; and codice_9 yields 4, −0.5.

===Data structures===
&quot;Sequence&quot; types in Common Lisp include lists, vectors, bit-vectors, and strings. There are many operations that can work on any sequence type.

As in almost all other Lisp dialects, &quot;lists&quot; in Common Lisp are composed of &quot;conses&quot;, sometimes called &quot;cons cells&quot; or &quot;pairs&quot;. A cons is a data structure with two slots, called its &quot;car&quot; and &quot;cdr&quot;. A list is a linked chain of conses or the empty list. Each cons&#x27;s car refers to a member of the list (possibly another list). Each cons&#x27;s cdr refers to the next cons—except for the last cons in a list, whose cdr refers to the codice_10 value. Conses can also easily be used to implement trees and other complex data structures; though it is usually advised to use structure or class instances instead. It is also possible to create circular data structures with conses.

Common Lisp supports multidimensional &quot;arrays&quot;, and can dynamically resize &quot;adjustable&quot; arrays if required. Multidimensional arrays can be used for matrix mathematics. A &quot;vector&quot; is a one-dimensional array. Arrays can carry any type as members (even mixed types in the same array) or can be specialized to contain a specific type of members, as in a vector of bits. Usually, only a few types are supported. Many implementations can optimize array functions when the array used is type-specialized. Two type-specialized array types are standard: a &quot;string&quot; is a vector of characters, while a &quot;bit-vector&quot; is a vector of bits.

&quot;Hash tables&quot; store associations between data objects. Any object may be used as key or value. Hash tables are automatically resized as needed.

&quot;Packages&quot; are collections of symbols, used chiefly to separate the parts of a program into namespaces. A package may &quot;export&quot; some symbols, marking them as part of a public interface. Packages can use other packages.

&quot;Structures&quot;, similar in use to C structs and Pascal records, represent arbitrary complex data structures with any number and type of fields (called &quot;slots&quot;). Structures allow single-inheritance.

&quot;Classes&quot; are similar to structures, but offer more dynamic features and multiple-inheritance. (See CLOS). Classes have been added late to Common Lisp and there is some conceptual overlap with structures. Objects created of classes are called &quot;Instances&quot;. A special case is Generic Functions. Generic Functions are both functions and instances.

===Functions===
Common Lisp supports first-class functions. For instance, it is possible to write functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as well. This makes it possible to describe very general operations.

The Common Lisp library relies heavily on such higher-order functions. For example, the codice_11 function takes a relational operator as an argument and key function as an optional keyword argument. This can be used not only to sort any type of data, but also to sort data structures according to a key.
 ;; Sorts the list using the &gt; and &lt; function as the relational operator.
 (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #&#x27;&gt;) ; Returns (6 5 4 3 2 1)
 (sort (list 5 2 6 3 1 4) #&#x27;&lt;) ; Returns (1 2 3 4 5 6)
 ;; Sorts the list according to the first element of each sub-list.
 (sort (list &#x27;(9 A) &#x27;(3 B) &#x27;(4 C)) #&#x27;&lt; :key #&#x27;first) ; Returns ((3 B) (4 C) (9 A))
The evaluation model for functions is very simple. When the evaluator encounters a form codice_12 then it presumes that the symbol named f is one of the following:

# A special operator (easily checked against a fixed list)
# A macro operator (must have been defined previously)
# The name of a function (default), which may either be a symbol, or a sub-form beginning with the symbol codice_13.

If f is the name of a function, then the arguments a1, a2, ..., an are evaluated in left-to-right order, and the function is found and invoked with those values supplied as parameters.

====Defining functions====
The macro codice_14 defines functions where a function definition gives the name of the function, the names of any arguments, and a function body:
 (defun square (x)
 (* x x))
Function definitions may include compiler directives, known as &quot;declarations&quot;, which provide hints to the compiler about optimization settings or the data types of arguments. They may also include &quot;documentation strings&quot; (docstrings), which the Lisp system may use to provide interactive documentation:
 (defun square (x)
 &quot;Calculates the square of the single-float x.&quot;
 (declare (single-float x) (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 1)))
 (the single-float (* x x)))
Anonymous functions (function literals) are defined using codice_13 expressions, e.g. codice_16 for a function that squares its argument. Lisp programming style frequently uses higher-order functions for which it is useful to provide anonymous functions as arguments.

Local functions can be defined with codice_17 and codice_18.
 (flet ((square (x)
 (* x x)))
 (square 3))
There are several other operators related to the definition and manipulation of functions. For instance, a function may be compiled with the codice_19 operator. (Some Lisp systems run functions using an interpreter by default unless instructed to compile; others compile every function).

====Defining generic functions and methods====
The macro codice_20 defines generic functions. Generic functions are a collection of methods.
The macro codice_21 defines methods.

Methods can specialize their parameters over CLOS &quot;standard classes&quot;, &quot;system classes&quot;, &quot;structure classes&quot; or individual objects. For many types, there are corresponding &quot;system classes&quot;.

When a generic function is called, multiple-dispatch will determine the effective method to use.
 (defgeneric add (a b))

 (defmethod add ((a number) (b number))
 (+ a b))

 (defmethod add ((a vector) (b number))
 (map &#x27;vector (lambda (n) (+ n b)) a))

 (defmethod add ((a vector) (b vector))
 (map &#x27;vector #&#x27;+ a b))
(defmethod add ((a string) (b string))
 (concatenate &#x27;string a b))
 (add 2 3) ; returns 5
 (add #(1 2 3 4) 7) ; returns #(8 9 10 11)
 (add #(1 2 3 4) #(4 3 2 1)) ; returns #(5 5 5 5)
 (add &quot;COMMON &quot; &quot;LISP&quot;) ; returns &quot;COMMON LISP&quot;
Generic Functions are also a first class data type. There are many more features to Generic Functions and Methods than described above.

====The function namespace====
The namespace for function names is separate from the namespace for data variables. This is a key difference between Common Lisp and Scheme. For Common Lisp, operators that define names in the function namespace include codice_14, codice_17, codice_18, codice_21 and codice_20.

To pass a function by name as an argument to another function, one must use the codice_27 special operator, commonly abbreviated as codice_28. The first codice_11 example above refers to the function named by the symbol codice_30 in the function namespace, with the code codice_31. Conversely, to call a function passed in such a way, one would use the codice_32 operator on the argument.

Scheme&#x27;s evaluation model is simpler: there is only one namespace, and all positions in the form are evaluated (in any order) – not just the arguments. Code written in one dialect is therefore sometimes confusing to programmers more experienced in the other. For instance, many Common Lisp programmers like to use descriptive variable names such as &quot;list&quot; or &quot;string&quot; which could cause problems in Scheme, as they would locally shadow function names.

Whether a separate namespace for functions is an advantage is a source of contention in the Lisp community. It is usually referred to as the &quot;Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 debate&quot;. Lisp-1 refers to Scheme&#x27;s model and Lisp-2 refers to Common Lisp&#x27;s model. These names were coined in a 1988 paper by Richard P. Gabriel and Kent Pitman, which extensively compares the two approaches.

====Multiple return values====

Common Lisp supports the concept of &quot;multiple values&quot;, where any expression always has a single &quot;primary value&quot;, but it might also have any number of &quot;secondary values&quot;, which might be received and inspected by interested callers. This concept is distinct from returning a list value, as the secondary values are fully optional, and passed via a dedicated side channel. This means that callers may remain entirely unaware of the secondary values being there if they have no need for them, and it makes it convenient to use the mechanism for communicating information that is sometimes useful, but not always necessary. For example,

* The codice_33 function rounds the given number to an integer towards zero. However, it also returns a remainder as a secondary value, making it very easy to determine what value was truncated. It also supports an optional divisor parameter, which can be used to perform Euclidean division trivially:

(let ((x 1266778)
 (y 458))
 (multiple-value-bind (quotient remainder)
 (truncate x y)
 (format nil &quot;~A divided by ~A is ~A remainder ~A&quot; x y quotient remainder)))

;;;; =&gt; &quot;1266778 divided by 458 is 2765 remainder 408&quot;
* codice_34 returns the value of a key in an associative map, or the default value otherwise, and a secondary Boolean indicating whether the value was found. Thus code that does not care about whether the value was found or provided as the default can simply use it as-is, but when such distinction is important, it might inspect the secondary Boolean and react appropriately. Both use cases are supported by the same call and neither is unnecessarily burdened or constrained by the other. Having this feature at the language level removes the need to check for the existence of the key or compare it to null as would be done in other languages.

(defun get-answer (library)
 (gethash &#x27;answer library 42))

(defun the-answer-1 (library)
 (format nil &quot;The answer is ~A&quot; (get-answer library)))
;;;; Returns &quot;The answer is 42&quot; if ANSWER not present in LIBRARY

(defun the-answer-2 (library)
 (multiple-value-bind (answer sure-p)
 (get-answer library)
 (if (not sure-p)
 &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;
 (format nil &quot;The answer is ~A&quot; answer))))
;;;; Returns &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; if ANSWER not present in LIBRARY
Multiple values are supported by a handful of standard forms, most common of which are the codice_35 special form for accessing secondary values and codice_36 for returning multiple values:
(defun magic-eight-ball ()
 &quot;Return an outlook prediction, with the probability as a secondary value&quot;
 (values &quot;Outlook good&quot; (random 1.0)))

;;;; =&gt; &quot;Outlook good&quot;
;;;; =&gt; 0.3187
===Other types===
Other data types in Common Lisp include:

*&quot;Pathnames&quot; represent files and directories in the filesystem. The Common Lisp pathname facility is more general than most operating systems&#x27; file naming conventions, making Lisp programs&#x27; access to files broadly portable across diverse systems.
*Input and output &quot;streams&quot; represent sources and sinks of binary or textual data, such as the terminal or open files.
*Common Lisp has a built-in pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). &quot;Random state&quot; objects represent reusable sources of pseudo-random numbers, allowing the user to seed the PRNG or cause it to replay a sequence.
*&quot;Conditions&quot; are a type used to represent errors, exceptions, and other &quot;interesting&quot; events to which a program may respond.
*&quot;Classes&quot; are first-class objects, and are themselves instances of classes called metaobject classes (metaclasses for short).
*&quot;Readtables&quot; are a type of object which control how Common Lisp&#x27;s reader parses the text of source code. By controlling which readtable is in use when code is read in, the programmer can change or extend the language&#x27;s syntax.

==Scope==

Like programs in many other programming languages, Common Lisp programs make use of names to refer to variables, functions, and many other kinds of entities. Named references are subject to scope.

The association between a name and the entity which the name refers to is called a binding.

Scope refers to the set of circumstances in which a name is determined to have a particular binding.

===Determiners of scope===

The circumstances which determine scope in Common Lisp include:

* the location of a reference within an expression. If it&#x27;s the leftmost position of a compound, it refers to a special operator or a macro or function binding, otherwise to a variable binding or something else.
* the kind of expression in which the reference takes place. For instance, codice_37 means transfer control to label codice_38, whereas codice_39 refers to the variable codice_38. Both scopes of codice_38 can be active in the same region of program text, since tagbody labels are in a separate namespace from variable names. A special form or macro form has complete control over the meanings of all symbols in its syntax. For instance, in codice_42, a class definition, the codice_43 is a list of base classes, so these names are looked up in the space of class names, and codice_38 isn&#x27;t a reference to an existing binding, but the name of a new class being derived from codice_45 and codice_46. These facts emerge purely from the semantics of codice_47. The only generic fact about this expression is that codice_47 refers to a macro binding; everything else is up to codice_47.
* the location of the reference within the program text. For instance, if a reference to variable codice_38 is enclosed in a binding construct such as a codice_51 which defines a binding for codice_38, then the reference is in the scope created by that binding.
* for a variable reference, whether or not a variable symbol has been, locally or globally, declared special. This determines whether the reference is resolved within a lexical environment, or within a dynamic environment.
* the specific instance of the environment in which the reference is resolved. An environment is a run-time dictionary which maps symbols to bindings. Each kind of reference uses its own kind of environment. References to lexical variables are resolved in a lexical environment, et cetera. More than one environment can be associated with the same reference. For instance, thanks to recursion or the use of multiple threads, multiple activations of the same function can exist at the same time. These activations share the same program text, but each has its own lexical environment instance.

To understand what a symbol refers to, the Common Lisp programmer must know what kind of reference is being expressed, what kind of scope it uses if it is a variable reference (dynamic versus lexical scope), and also the run-time situation: in what environment is the reference resolved, where was the binding introduced into the environment, et cetera.

===Kinds of environment===

====Global====

Some environments in Lisp are globally pervasive. For instance, if a new type is defined, it is known everywhere thereafter. References to that type look it up in this global environment.

====Dynamic====

One type of environment in Common Lisp is the dynamic environment. Bindings established in this environment have dynamic extent, which means that a binding is established at the start of the execution of some construct, such as a codice_51 block, and disappears when that construct finishes executing: its lifetime is tied to the dynamic activation and deactivation of a block. However, a dynamic binding is not just visible within that block; it is also visible to all functions invoked from that block. This type of visibility is known as indefinite scope. Bindings which exhibit dynamic extent (lifetime tied to the activation and deactivation of a block) and indefinite scope (visible to all functions which are called from that block) are said to have dynamic scope.

Common Lisp has support for dynamically scoped variables, which are also called special variables. Certain other kinds of bindings are necessarily dynamically scoped also, such as restarts and catch tags. Function bindings cannot be dynamically scoped using codice_17 (which only provides lexically scoped function bindings), but function objects (a first-level object in Common Lisp) can be assigned to dynamically scoped variables, bound using codice_51 in dynamic scope, then called using codice_32 or codice_57.

Dynamic scope is extremely useful because it adds referential clarity and discipline to global variables. Global variables are frowned upon in computer science as potential sources of error, because they can give rise to ad-hoc, covert channels of communication among modules that lead to unwanted, surprising interactions.

In Common Lisp, a special variable which has only a top-level binding behaves just like a global variable in other programming languages. A new value can be stored into it, and that value simply replaces what is in the top-level binding. Careless replacement of the value of a global variable is at the heart of bugs caused by the use of global variables. However, another way to work with a special variable is to give it a new, local binding within an expression. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;rebinding&quot; the variable. Binding a dynamically scoped variable temporarily creates a new memory location for that variable, and associates the name with that location. While that binding is in effect, all references to that variable refer to the new binding; the previous binding is hidden. When execution of the binding expression terminates, the temporary memory location is gone, and the old binding is revealed, with the original value intact. Of course, multiple dynamic bindings for the same variable can be nested.

In Common Lisp implementations which support multithreading, dynamic scopes are specific to each thread of execution. Thus special variables serve as an abstraction for thread local storage. If one thread rebinds a special variable, this rebinding has no effect on that variable in other threads. The value stored in a binding can only be retrieved by the thread which created that binding. If each thread binds some special variable codice_58, then codice_58 behaves like thread-local storage. Among threads which do not rebind codice_58, it behaves like an ordinary global: all of these threads refer to the same top-level binding of codice_58.

Dynamic variables can be used to extend the execution context with additional context information which is implicitly passed from function to function without having to appear as an extra function parameter. This is especially useful when the control transfer has to pass through layers of unrelated code, which simply cannot be extended with extra parameters to pass the additional data. A situation like this usually calls for a global variable. That global variable must be saved and restored, so that the scheme doesn&#x27;t break under recursion: dynamic variable rebinding takes care of this. And that variable must be made thread-local (or else a big mutex must be used) so the scheme doesn&#x27;t break under threads: dynamic scope implementations can take care of this also.

In the Common Lisp library, there are many standard special variables. For instance, all standard I/O streams are stored in the top-level bindings of well-known special variables. The standard output stream is stored in *standard-output*.

Suppose a function foo writes to standard output:
 (defun foo ()
 (format t &quot;Hello, world&quot;))
To capture its output in a character string, *standard-output* can be bound to a string stream and called:
 (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
 (foo))
 -&gt; &quot;Hello, world&quot; ; gathered output returned as a string

====Lexical====

Common Lisp supports lexical environments. Formally, the bindings in a lexical environment have lexical scope and may have either an indefinite extent or dynamic extent, depending on the type of namespace. Lexical scope means that visibility is physically restricted to the block in which the binding is established. References which are not textually (i.e. lexically) embedded in that block simply do not see that binding.

The tags in a TAGBODY have lexical scope. The expression (GO X) is erroneous if it is not embedded in a TAGBODY which contains a label X. However, the label bindings disappear when the TAGBODY terminates its execution, because they have dynamic extent. If that block of code is re-entered by the invocation of a lexical closure, it is invalid for the body of that closure to try to transfer control to a tag via GO:
 (defvar *stashed*) ;; will hold a function

 (tagbody
 (setf *stashed* (lambda () (go some-label)))
 (go end-label) ;; skip the (print &quot;Hello&quot;)
 some-label
 (print &quot;Hello&quot;)
 end-label)
 -&gt; NIL
When the TAGBODY is executed, it first evaluates the setf form which stores a function in the special variable *stashed*. Then the (go end-label) transfers control to end-label, skipping the code (print &quot;Hello&quot;). Since end-label is at the end of the tagbody, the tagbody terminates, yielding NIL. Suppose that the previously remembered function is now called:
 (funcall *stashed*) ;; Error!
This situation is erroneous. One implementation&#x27;s response is an error condition containing the message, &quot;GO: tagbody for tag SOME-LABEL has already been left&quot;. The function tried to evaluate (go some-label), which is lexically embedded in the tagbody, and resolves to the label. However, the tagbody isn&#x27;t executing (its extent has ended), and so the control transfer cannot take place.

Local function bindings in Lisp have lexical scope, and variable bindings also have lexical scope by default. By contrast with GO labels, both of these have indefinite extent. When a lexical function or variable binding is established, that binding continues to exist for as long as references to it are possible, even after the construct which established that binding has terminated. References to lexical variables and functions after the termination of their establishing construct are possible thanks to lexical closures.

Lexical binding is the default binding mode for Common Lisp variables. For an individual symbol, it can be switched to dynamic scope, either by a local declaration, by a global declaration. The latter may occur implicitly through the use of a construct like DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER. It is an important convention in Common Lisp programming that special (i.e. dynamically scoped) variables have names which begin and end with an asterisk sigil codice_62 in what is called the &quot;earmuff convention&quot;. If adhered to, this convention effectively creates a separate namespace for special variables, so that variables intended to be lexical are not accidentally made special.

Lexical scope is useful for several reasons.

Firstly, references to variables and functions can be compiled to efficient machine code, because the run-time environment structure is relatively simple. In many cases it can be optimized to stack storage, so opening and closing lexical scopes has minimal overhead. Even in cases where full closures must be generated, access to the closure&#x27;s environment is still efficient; typically each variable becomes an offset into a vector of bindings, and so a variable reference becomes a simple load or store instruction with a base-plus-offset addressing mode.

Secondly, lexical scope (combined with indefinite extent) gives rise to the lexical closure, which in turn creates a whole paradigm of programming centered around the use of functions being first-class objects, which is at the root of functional programming.

Thirdly, perhaps most importantly, even if lexical closures are not exploited, the use of lexical scope isolates program modules from unwanted interactions. Due to their restricted visibility, lexical variables are private. If one module A binds a lexical variable X, and calls another module B, references to X in B will not accidentally resolve to the X bound in A. B simply has no access to X. For situations in which disciplined interactions through a variable are desirable, Common Lisp provides special variables. Special variables allow for a module A to set up a binding for a variable X which is visible to another module B, called from A. Being able to do this is an advantage, and being able to prevent it from happening is also an advantage; consequently, Common Lisp supports both lexical and dynamic scope.

==Macros==
A &quot;macro&quot; in Lisp superficially resembles a function in usage. However, rather than representing an expression which is evaluated, it represents a transformation of the program source code. The macro gets the source it surrounds as arguments, binds them to its parameters and computes a new source form. This new form can also use a macro. The macro expansion is repeated until the new source form does not use a macro. The final computed form is the source code executed at runtime.

Typical uses of macros in Lisp:

* new control structures (example: looping constructs, branching constructs)
* scoping and binding constructs
* simplified syntax for complex and repeated source code
* top-level defining forms with compile-time side-effects
* data-driven programming
* embedded domain specific languages (examples: SQL, HTML, Prolog)
* implicit finalization forms

Various standard Common Lisp features also need to be implemented as macros, such as:

* the standard codice_63 abstraction, to allow custom compile-time expansions of assignment/access operators
* codice_64, codice_65, codice_66 and other similar codice_67 macros
* Depending on implementation, codice_68 or codice_69 is a macro built on the other, the special operator; codice_70 and codice_71 consist of macros
* The powerful codice_72 domain-specific language

Macros are defined by the &quot;defmacro&quot; macro. The special operator &quot;macrolet&quot; allows the definition of local (lexically scoped) macros. It is also possible to define macros for symbols using &quot;define-symbol-macro&quot; and &quot;symbol-macrolet&quot;.

Paul Graham&#x27;s book On Lisp describes the use of macros in Common Lisp in detail. Doug Hoyte&#x27;s book Let Over Lambda extends the discussion on macros, claiming &quot;Macros are the single greatest advantage that lisp has as a programming language and the single greatest advantage of any programming language.&quot; Hoyte provides several examples of iterative development of macros.

===Example using a macro to define a new control structure===
Macros allow Lisp programmers to create new syntactic forms in the language. One typical use is to create new control structures. The example macro provides an codice_73 looping construct. The syntax is:
(until test form*)
The macro definition for &quot;until&quot;:

(defmacro until (test &amp;body body)
 (let ((start-tag (gensym &quot;START&quot;))
 (end-tag (gensym &quot;END&quot;)))
 `(tagbody ,start-tag
 (when ,test (go ,end-tag))
 (progn ,@body)
 (go ,start-tag)
 ,end-tag)))
&quot;tagbody&quot; is a primitive Common Lisp special operator which provides the ability to name tags and use the &quot;go&quot; form to jump to those tags. The backquote &quot;`&quot; provides a notation that provides code templates, where the value of forms preceded with a comma are filled in. Forms preceded with comma and at-sign are &quot;spliced&quot; in. The tagbody form tests the end condition. If the condition is true, it jumps to the end tag. Otherwise, the provided body code is executed and then it jumps to the start tag.

An example of using the above &quot;until&quot; macro:

(until (= (random 10) 0)
 (write-line &quot;Hello&quot;))
The code can be expanded using the function &quot;macroexpand-1&quot;. The expansion for the above example looks like this:

(TAGBODY
 #:START1136
 (WHEN (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))
 (GO #:END1137))
 (PROGN (WRITE-LINE &quot;hello&quot;))
 (GO #:START1136)
 #:END1137)
During macro expansion the value of the variable &quot;test&quot; is &quot;(= (random 10) 0)&quot; and the value of the variable &quot;body&quot; is &quot;((write-line &quot;Hello&quot;))&quot;. The body is a list of forms.

Symbols are usually automatically upcased. The expansion uses the TAGBODY with two labels. The symbols for these labels are computed by GENSYM and are not interned in any package. Two &quot;go&quot; forms use these tags to jump to. Since &quot;tagbody&quot; is a primitive operator in Common Lisp (and not a macro), it will not be expanded into something else. The expanded form uses the &quot;when&quot; macro, which also will be expanded. Fully expanding a source form is called &quot;code walking&quot;.

In the fully expanded (&quot;walked&quot;) form, the &quot;when&quot; form is replaced by the primitive &quot;if&quot;:

(TAGBODY
 #:START1136
 (IF (ZEROP (RANDOM 10))
 (PROGN (GO #:END1137))
 NIL)
 (PROGN (WRITE-LINE &quot;hello&quot;))
 (GO #:START1136))
 #:END1137)
All macros must be expanded before the source code containing them can be evaluated or compiled normally. Macros can be considered functions that accept and return S-expressions – similar to abstract syntax trees, but not limited to those. These functions are invoked before the evaluator or compiler to produce the final source code. Macros are written in normal Common Lisp, and may use any Common Lisp (or third-party) operator available.

===Variable capture and shadowing===
Common Lisp macros are capable of what is commonly called &quot;variable capture&quot;, where symbols in the macro-expansion body coincide with those in the calling context, allowing the programmer to create macros wherein various symbols have special meaning. The term &quot;variable capture&quot; is somewhat misleading, because all namespaces are vulnerable to unwanted capture, including the operator and function namespace, the tagbody label namespace, catch tag, condition handler and restart namespaces.

&quot;Variable capture&quot; can introduce software defects. This happens in one of the following two ways:

* In the first way, a macro expansion can inadvertently make a symbolic reference which the macro writer assumed will resolve in a global namespace, but the code where the macro is expanded happens to provide a local, shadowing definition which steals that reference. Let this be referred to as type 1 capture.
* The second way, type 2 capture, is just the opposite: some of the arguments of the macro are pieces of code supplied by the macro caller, and those pieces of code are written such that they make references to surrounding bindings. However, the macro inserts these pieces of code into an expansion which defines its own bindings that accidentally captures some of these references.

The Scheme dialect of Lisp provides a macro-writing system which provides the referential transparency that eliminates both types of capture problem. This type of macro system is sometimes called &quot;hygienic&quot;, in particular by its proponents (who regard macro systems which do not automatically solve this problem as unhygienic). 

In Common Lisp, macro hygiene is ensured one of two different ways.

One approach is to use gensyms: guaranteed-unique symbols which can be used in a macro-expansion without threat of capture. The use of gensyms in a macro definition is a manual chore, but macros can be written which simplify the instantiation and use of gensyms. Gensyms solve type 2 capture easily, but they are not applicable to type 1 capture in the same way, because the macro expansion cannot rename the interfering symbols in the surrounding code which capture its references. Gensyms could be used to provide stable aliases for the global symbols which the macro expansion needs. The macro expansion would use these secret aliases rather than the well-known names, so redefinition of the well-known names would have no ill effect on the macro.

Another approach is to use packages. A macro defined in its own package can simply use internal symbols in that package in its expansion. The use of packages deals with type 1 and type 2 capture.

However, packages don&#x27;t solve the type 1 capture of references to standard Common Lisp functions and operators. The reason is that the use of packages to solve capture problems revolves around the use of private symbols (symbols in one package, which are not imported into, or otherwise made visible in other packages). Whereas the Common Lisp library symbols are external, and frequently imported into or made visible in user-defined packages.

The following is an example of unwanted capture in the operator namespace, occurring in the expansion of a macro:
 ;; expansion of UNTIL makes liberal use of DO
 (defmacro until (expression &amp;body body)
 `(do () (,expression) ,@body))

 ;; macrolet establishes lexical operator binding for DO
 (macrolet ((do (...) ... something else ...))
 (until (= (random 10) 0) (write-line &quot;Hello&quot;)))
The codice_73 macro will expand into a form which calls codice_75 which is intended to refer to the standard Common Lisp macro codice_75. However, in this context, codice_75 may have a completely different meaning, so codice_73 may not work properly.

Common Lisp solves the problem of the shadowing of standard operators and functions by forbidding their redefinition. Because it redefines the standard operator codice_75, the preceding is actually a fragment of non-conforming Common Lisp, which allows implementations to diagnose and reject it.

==Condition system==
The &quot;condition system&quot; is responsible for exception handling in Common Lisp. It provides &quot;conditions&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;s and &quot;restart&quot;s. &quot;Condition&quot;s are objects describing an exceptional situation (for example an error). If a &quot;condition&quot; is signaled, the Common Lisp system searches for a &quot;handler&quot; for this condition type and calls the handler. The &quot;handler&quot; can now search for restarts and use one of these restarts to automatically repair the current problem, using information such as the condition type and any relevant information provided as part of the condition object, and call the appropriate restart function.

These restarts, if unhandled by code, can be presented to users (as part of a user interface, that of a debugger for example), so that the user can select and invoke one of the available restarts. Since the condition handler is called in the context of the error (without unwinding the stack), full error recovery is possible in many cases, where other exception handling systems would have already terminated the current routine. The debugger itself can also be customized or replaced using the codice_80 dynamic variable. Code found within &quot;unwind-protect&quot; forms such as finalizers will also be executed as appropriate despite the exception.

In the following example (using Symbolics Genera) the user tries to open a file in a Lisp function &quot;test&quot; called from the Read-Eval-Print-LOOP (REPL), when the file does not exist. The Lisp system presents four restarts. The user selects the &quot;Retry OPEN using a different pathname&quot; restart and enters a different pathname (lispm-init.lisp instead of lispm-int.lisp). The user code does not contain any error handling code. The whole error handling and restart code is provided by the Lisp system, which can handle and repair the error without terminating the user code.
Command: (test &quot;&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp&quot;)

Error: The file was not found.
 For lispm:&gt;zippy&gt;lispm-int.lisp.newest

==Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)==

Common Lisp includes a toolkit for object-oriented programming, the Common Lisp Object System or CLOS. Peter Norvig explains how many Design Patterns are simpler to implement in a dynamic language with the features of CLOS (Multiple Inheritance, Mixins, Multimethods, Metaclasses, Method combinations, etc.).
Several extensions to Common Lisp for object-oriented programming have been proposed to be included into the ANSI Common Lisp standard, but eventually CLOS was adopted as the standard object-system for Common Lisp. CLOS is a dynamic object system with multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance, and differs radically from the OOP facilities found in static languages such as C++ or Java. As a dynamic object system, CLOS allows changes at runtime to generic functions and classes. Methods can be added and removed, classes can be added and redefined, objects can be updated for class changes and the class of objects can be changed.

CLOS has been integrated into ANSI Common Lisp. Generic functions can be used like normal functions and are a first-class data type. Every CLOS class is integrated into the Common Lisp type system. Many Common Lisp types have a corresponding class. There is more potential use of CLOS for Common Lisp. The specification does not say whether conditions are implemented with CLOS. Pathnames and streams could be implemented with CLOS. These further usage possibilities of CLOS for ANSI Common Lisp are not part of the standard. Actual Common Lisp implementations use CLOS for pathnames, streams, input–output, conditions, the implementation of CLOS itself and more.

==Compiler and interpreter==
A Lisp interpreter directly executes Lisp source code provided as Lisp objects (lists, symbols, numbers, ...) read from s-expressions. A Lisp compiler generates bytecode or machine code from Lisp source code. Common Lisp allows both individual Lisp functions to be compiled in memory and the compilation of whole files to externally stored compiled code (&quot;fasl&quot; files).

Several implementations of earlier Lisp dialects provided both an interpreter and a compiler. Unfortunately often the semantics were different. These earlier Lisps implemented lexical scoping in the compiler and dynamic scoping in the interpreter. Common Lisp requires that both the interpreter and compiler use lexical scoping by default. The Common Lisp standard describes both the semantics of the interpreter and a compiler. The compiler can be called using the function &quot;compile&quot; for individual functions and using the function &quot;compile-file&quot; for files. Common Lisp allows type declarations and provides ways to influence the compiler code generation policy. For the latter various optimization qualities can be given values between 0 (not important) and 3 (most important): &quot;speed&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;debug&quot; and &quot;compilation-speed&quot;.

There is also a function to evaluate Lisp code: codice_81. codice_81 takes code as pre-parsed s-expressions and not, like in some other languages, as text strings. This way code can be constructed with the usual Lisp functions for constructing lists and symbols and then this code can be evaluated with the function codice_81. Several Common Lisp implementations (like Clozure CL and SBCL) are implementing codice_81 using their compiler. This way code is compiled, even though it is evaluated using the function codice_81.

The file compiler is invoked using the function &quot;compile-file&quot;. The generated file with compiled code is called a &quot;fasl&quot; (from &quot;fast load&quot;) file. These &quot;fasl&quot; files and also source code files can be loaded with the function &quot;load&quot; into a running Common Lisp system. Depending on the implementation, the file compiler generates byte-code (for example for the Java Virtual Machine), C language code (which then is compiled with a C compiler) or, directly, native code.

Common Lisp implementations can be used interactively, even though the code gets fully compiled. The idea of an Interpreted language thus does not apply for interactive Common Lisp.

The language makes a distinction between read-time, compile-time, load-time, and run-time, and allows user code to also make this distinction to perform the wanted type of processing at the wanted step.

Some special operators are provided to especially suit interactive development; for instance, codice_86 will only assign a value to its provided variable if it wasn&#x27;t already bound, while codice_87 will always perform the assignment. This distinction is useful when interactively evaluating, compiling and loading code in a live image.

Some features are also provided to help writing compilers and interpreters. Symbols consist of first-level objects and are directly manipulable by user code. The codice_88 special operator allows to create lexical bindings programmatically, while packages are also manipulable. The Lisp compiler is available at runtime to compile files or individual functions. These make it easy to use Lisp as an intermediate compiler or interpreter for another language.

==Code examples==

===Birthday paradox===
The following program calculates the smallest number of people in a room for whom the probability of unique birthdays is less than 50% (the birthday paradox, where for 1 person the probability is obviously 100%, for 2 it is 364/365, etc.). The answer is 23.

In Common Lisp, by convention, constants are enclosed with + characters.
(defconstant +year-size+ 365)

(defun birthday-paradox (probability number-of-people)
 (let ((new-probability (* (/ (- +year-size+ number-of-people)
 +year-size+)
 probability)))
 (if (&lt; new-probability 0.5)
 (1+ number-of-people)
 (birthday-paradox new-probability (1+ number-of-people)))))
Calling the example function using the REPL (Read Eval Print Loop):

CL-USER &gt; (birthday-paradox 1.0 1)
23
===Sorting a list of person objects===

We define a class codice_89 and a method for displaying the name and age of a person.
Next we define a group of persons as a list of codice_89 objects.
Then we iterate over the sorted list.
(defclass person ()
 ((name :initarg :name :accessor person-name)
 (age :initarg :age :accessor person-age))
 (:documentation &quot;The class PERSON with slots NAME and AGE.&quot;))

(defmethod display ((object person) stream)
 &quot;Displaying a PERSON object to an output stream.&quot;
 (with-slots (name age) object
 (format stream &quot;~a (~a)&quot; name age)))

(defparameter *group*
 (list (make-instance &#x27;person :name &quot;Bob&quot; :age 33)
 (make-instance &#x27;person :name &quot;Chris&quot; :age 16)
 (make-instance &#x27;person :name &quot;Ash&quot; :age 23))
 &quot;A list of PERSON objects.&quot;)

(dolist (person (sort (copy-list *group*)
 :key #&#x27;person-age))
 (display person *standard-output*)
 (terpri))
It prints the three names with descending age.

===Exponentiating by squaring===

Use of the LOOP macro is demonstrated:
(defun power (x n)
 (loop with result = 1
 while (plusp n)
 when (oddp n) do (setf result (* result x))
 do (setf x (* x x)
 n (truncate n 2))
 finally (return result)))
Example use:
CL-USER &gt; (power 2 200)
1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
Compare with the built in exponentiation:
CL-USER &gt; (= (expt 2 200) (power 2 200))
T
===Find the list of available shells===

WITH-OPEN-FILE is a macro that opens a file and provides a stream. When the form is returning, the file is automatically closed. FUNCALL calls a function object. The LOOP collects all lines that match the predicate.
(defun list-matching-lines (file predicate)
 &quot;Returns a list of lines in file, for which the predicate applied to
 the line returns T.&quot;
 (with-open-file (stream file)
 (loop for line = (read-line stream nil nil)
 while line
 when (funcall predicate line)
 collect it)))
The function AVAILABLE-SHELLS calls the above function LIST-MATCHING-LINES with a pathname and an anonymous function as the predicate. The predicate returns the pathname of a shell or NIL (if the string is not the filename of a shell).
(defun available-shells (&amp;optional (file #p&quot;/etc/shells&quot;))
 (list-matching-lines
 file
 (lambda (line)
 (and (plusp (length line))
 (char= (char line 0) #\/)
 (pathname
 (string-right-trim &#x27;(#\space #\tab) line))))))
Example results (on Mac OS X 10.6):
CL-USER &gt; (available-shells)
(#P&quot;/bin/bash&quot; #P&quot;/bin/csh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/ksh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/sh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/tcsh&quot; #P&quot;/bin/zsh&quot;)
==Comparison with other Lisps==

Common Lisp is most frequently compared with, and contrasted to, Scheme—if only because they are the two most popular Lisp dialects. Scheme predates CL, and comes not only from the same Lisp tradition but from some of the same engineers—Guy Steele, with whom Gerald Jay Sussman designed Scheme, chaired the standards committee for Common Lisp.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as Emacs Lisp and AutoLISP which are extension languages embedded in particular products (GNU Emacs and AutoCAD, respectively). Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like Scheme) uses lexical variable scope by default for both interpreted and compiled code.

Most of the Lisp systems whose designs contributed to Common Lisp—such as ZetaLisp and Franz Lisp—used dynamically scoped variables in their interpreters and lexically scoped variables in their compilers. Scheme introduced the sole use of lexically scoped variables to Lisp; an inspiration from ALGOL 68. CL supports dynamically scoped variables as well, but they must be explicitly declared as &quot;special&quot;. There are no differences in scoping between ANSI CL interpreters and compilers.

Common Lisp is sometimes termed a &quot;Lisp-2&quot; and Scheme a &quot;Lisp-1&quot;, referring to CL&#x27;s use of separate namespaces for functions and variables. (In fact, CL has &quot;many&quot; namespaces, such as those for go tags, block names, and codice_72 keywords). There is a long-standing controversy between CL and Scheme advocates over the tradeoffs involved in multiple namespaces. In Scheme, it is (broadly) necessary to avoid giving variables names that clash with functions; Scheme functions frequently have arguments named codice_92, codice_93, or codice_94 so as not to conflict with the system function codice_95. However, in CL it is necessary to explicitly refer to the function namespace when passing a function as an argument—which is also a common occurrence, as in the codice_11 example above.

CL also differs from Scheme in its handling of Boolean values. Scheme uses the special values #t and #f to represent truth and falsity. CL follows the older Lisp convention of using the symbols T and NIL, with NIL standing also for the empty list. In CL, &quot;any&quot; non-NIL value is treated as true by conditionals, such as codice_68, whereas in Scheme all non-#f values are treated as true. These conventions allow some operators in both languages to serve both as predicates (answering a Boolean-valued question) and as returning a useful value for further computation, but in Scheme the value &#x27;() which is equivalent to NIL in Common Lisp evaluates to true in a Boolean expression.

Lastly, the Scheme standards documents require tail-call optimization, which the CL standard does not. Most CL implementations do offer tail-call optimization, although often only when the programmer uses an optimization directive. Nonetheless, common CL coding style does not favor the ubiquitous use of recursion that Scheme style prefers—what a Scheme programmer would express with tail recursion, a CL user would usually express with an iterative expression in codice_75, codice_99, codice_72, or (more recently) with the codice_101 package.

==Implementations==

See the Category Common Lisp implementations.

Common Lisp is defined by a specification (like Ada and C) rather than by one implementation (like Perl). There are many implementations, and the standard details areas in which they may validly differ.

In addition, implementations tend to come with extensions, which provide functionality not covered in the standard:

* Interactive Top-Level (REPL)
* Garbage Collection
* Debugger, Stepper and Inspector
* Weak data structures (hash tables)
* Extensible sequences
* Extensible LOOP
* Environment access
* CLOS Meta-object Protocol
* CLOS based extensible streams
* CLOS based Condition System
* Network streams
* Persistent CLOS
* Unicode support
* Foreign-Language Interface (often to C)
* Operating System interface
* Java Interface
* Threads and Multiprocessing
* Application delivery (applications, dynamic libraries)
* Saving of images

Free and open-source software libraries have been created to support extensions to Common Lisp in a portable way, and are most notably found in the repositories of the Common-Lisp.net and CLOCC (Common Lisp Open Code Collection) projects.

Common Lisp implementations may use any mix of native code compilation, byte code compilation or interpretation. Common Lisp has been designed to support incremental compilers, file compilers and block compilers. Standard declarations to optimize compilation (such as function inlining or type specialization) are proposed in the language specification. Most Common Lisp implementations compile source code to native machine code. Some implementations can create (optimized) stand-alone applications. Others compile to interpreted bytecode, which is less efficient than native code, but eases binary-code portability. Some compilers compile Common Lisp code to C code. The misconception that Lisp is a purely interpreted language is most likely because Lisp environments provide an interactive prompt and that code is compiled one-by-one, in an incremental way. With Common Lisp incremental compilation is widely used.

Some Unix-based implementations (CLISP, SBCL) can be used as a scripting language; that is, invoked by the system transparently in the way that a Perl or Unix shell interpreter is.

; Clasp: A LLVM based implementation that seamlessly interoperates with C++ libraries. Runs on several Unix and Unix-like systems (including macOS).
; CLISP: A bytecode-compiling implementation, portable and runs on several Unix and Unix-like systems (including macOS), as well as Microsoft Windows and several other systems.
; Clozure CL (CCL): Originally a free and open-source fork of Macintosh Common Lisp. As that history implies, CCL was written for the Macintosh, but Clozure CL now runs on macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Windows. 32 and 64 bit x86 ports are supported on each platform. Additionally there are Power PC ports for Mac OS and Linux. CCL was previously known as OpenMCL, but that name is no longer used, to avoid confusion with the open source version of Macintosh Common Lisp.
; CMUCL: Originally from Carnegie Mellon University, now maintained as free and open-source software by a group of volunteers. CMUCL uses a fast native-code compiler. It is available on Linux and BSD for Intel x86; Linux for Alpha; macOS for Intel x86 and PowerPC; and Solaris, IRIX, and HP-UX on their native platforms.
; Corman Common Lisp: for Microsoft Windows. In January 2015 Corman Lisp has been published under MIT license.
; Embeddable Common Lisp (ECL): ECL includes a bytecode interpreter and compiler. It can also compile Lisp code to machine code via a C compiler. ECL then compiles Lisp code to C, compiles the C code with a C compiler and can then load the resulting machine code. It is also possible to embed ECL in C programs, and C code into Common Lisp programs.
; GNU Common Lisp (GCL): The GNU Project&#x27;s Lisp compiler. Not yet fully ANSI-compliant, GCL is however the implementation of choice for several large projects including the mathematical tools Maxima, AXIOM and (historically) ACL2. GCL runs on Linux under eleven different architectures, and also under Windows, Solaris, and FreeBSD.

; Movitz: Implements a Lisp environment for x86 computers without relying on any underlying OS.
; Poplog: Poplog implements a version of CL, with POP-11, and optionally Prolog, and Standard ML (SML), allowing mixed language programming. For all, the implementation language is POP-11, which is compiled incrementally. It also has an integrated Emacs-like editor that communicates with the compiler.
; Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL): A branch from CMUCL. &quot;Broadly speaking, SBCL is distinguished from CMU CL by a greater emphasis on maintainability.&quot; SBCL runs on the platforms CMUCL does, except HP/UX; in addition, it runs on Linux for AMD64, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, Windows x86 and AMD64. SBCL does not use an interpreter by default; all expressions are compiled to native code unless the user switches the interpreter on. The SBCL compiler generates fast native code according to a previous version of The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
; Ufasoft Common Lisp: port of CLISP for windows platform with core written in C++.

<doc id="6069" wikidata="Q1738927" url="?curid=6069" title="Color code">
<text>A color code is a system for encoding and representing non-color information with colors to facilitate communication. This information tends to be categorical (representing unordered/qualitative categories) though may also be sequential (representing an ordered/quantitative variable).

==History==
The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long-distance communication by use of flags, as in semaphore communication. The United Kingdom adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein red signified danger and white signified safety, with other colors having similar assignments of meaning.

As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as wiring in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical pills.

==Encoded Variable==
A color code encodes a variable, which may have different representations, where the color code type should match the variable type:
* Categorical variable – the variable may represent discrete values of unordered qualitative data (e.g. blood type)
** Binary variables are typically treated as a categorical variable (e.g. sex)
* Quantitative variable – the variable represents ordered, quantitative data (e.g. age)
** Discrete quantitative data (e.g. the 6 sides of a die: 1,2,3,4,5,6) are sometimes treated as a categorical variable, despite the ordered nature.

==Types==

The types of color code are:
* Categorical – the colors are unordered, but are chosen to maximize saliency of the colors, by maximizing color difference between all color pair permutations.
* Continuous – the colors are ordered and form a smooth color gradient.
* Discrete – only a subset of a continuous color code are used (still ordered), where each is distinguishable from the others.

===Categorical===
When color is the only varied attribute, the color code is &quot;unidimensional&quot;. When other attributes are varied (e.g. shape, size), the code is &quot;multidimensional&quot;, where the dimensions can be &quot;independent&quot; (each encoding separate variables) or &quot;redundant&quot; (encoding the same variable). Partial redundancy sees one variable as a subset of another. For example, playing card suits are multidimensional with color (black, red) and shape (club, diamond, heart, spade), which are partially redundant since clubs and spades are always black and diamonds and hearts are always red. Tasks using categorical color codes can be classified as identification tasks, where a single stimulus is shown and must be identified (connotatively or denotatively), versus search tasks, where a color stimulus must be found within a field of heterogenous stimuli. Performance in these tasks is measured by speed and/or accuracy.

The ideal color scheme for a categorical color code depends on whether speed or accuracy is more important. Despite humans being able to distinguish 150 distinct colors along the hue dimension during comparative task, evidence supports that color schemes where colors differ only by hue (equal luminosity and colorfulness) should have a maximum of eight categories with optimized stimulus spacing along the hue dimension, though this would not be color blind accessible. The IALA recommends categorical color codes in seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white and black. Adding redundant coding of luminosity and colorfulness adds information and increases speed and accuracy of color decoding tasks. Color codes are superior to others (encoding to letters, shape, size, etc.) in certain types of tasks. Adding color as a redundant attribute to a numeral or letter encoding in search tasks decreased time by 50–75%, but in unidimensional identification tasks, using alphanumeric or line inclination codes caused less errors than color codes.

Several studies demonstrate a subjective preference for color codes over achromatic codes (e.g. shapes), even in studies where color coding did not increase performance over achromatic coding. Subjects reported the tasks as less monotonous and less inducing of eye strain and fatigue.

The ability to discriminate color differences decreases rapidly as the visual angle subtends less than 12&#x27; (0.2° or ~2 mm at a viewing distance of 50 cm), so color stimulus of at least 3 mm in diameter or thickness is recommended when the color is on paper or on a screen. Under normal conditions, colored backgrounds do not affect the interpretation of color codes, but chromatic (and/or low) illumination of surface color code can degrade performance.

==Criticism==
Color codes present some potential problems. On forms and signage, the use of color can distract from black and white text.

Color codes are often designed without consideration for accessibility to color blind and blind people, and may even be inaccessible for those with normal color vision, since use of many colors to code many variables can lead to use of confusingly similar colors. Only 15–40% of the colorblind can correctly name surface color codes with 8–10 color categories, most of which test as mildly colorblind. This finding uses ideal illumination; when dimmer illumination is used, performance drops sharply.

==Examples==
Systems incorporating color-coding include:

*In electricity:
** 25-pair color code – telecommunications wiring
** Audio and video interfaces and connectors § Color codes
** Optical fibers § Color codes
** Electrical wiring – AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires
** Electronic color code AKA resistor or EIA color code (today – IEC 60062:2016)
** Ethernet twisted-pair wiring – local area networks
** Jumper cables used to jump-start a vehicle
** PC99 connectors and ports
** Surround sound ports and cables
** Three-phase electric power § Color codes (electrical wiring)
*In video games
** Health and magic points
** To distinguish friend from foe, for instance in &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;League of Legends&quot;
** To distinguish rarity or quality of items in adventure and role-playing games
*In navigation:
** Characteristic light
** Navigation light
** Sea mark
** Traffic lights
*Other technology:
** At point of sale (especially for packaging within a huge range of products: to quickly differentiate variants, brands, categories)
** Bottled gases
** Fire extinguishers
** Kerbside collection 
** Pipe marking
** Queen bee birth year code
** Underground utility location
** Hospital emergency codes often incorporate colors (such as the widely used &quot;Code Blue&quot; indicating a cardiac arrest),
*In military use:
** Homeland Security Advisory System
** Artillery shells and other munitions, which are color-coded according to their pyrotechnic contents
** List of Rainbow Codes
** NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems
** Rainbow Herbicides
*In social functions:
** Black hat hacking, white hat, grey hat
** Blue-collar worker, white-collar worker, pink-collar worker, grey-collar, green-collar worker
** Handkerchief code
** ISO 22324, Guidelines for color-coded alerts in public warning

<doc id="6085" wikidata="Q217847" url="?curid=6085" title="Cauchy sequence">
<text>In mathematics, a Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. More precisely, given any small positive distance, all excluding a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other. Cauchy sequences are named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy; they may occasionally be known as fundamental sequences.

It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the term. For instance, in the sequence of square roots of natural numbers:
formula_1
the consecutive terms become arbitrarily close to each other – their differences
formula_2
tend to zero as the index grows. However, with growing values of , the terms formula_3 become arbitrarily large. So, for any index and distance , there exists an index big enough such that formula_4 As a result, no matter how far one goes, the remaining terms of the sequence never get close to ; hence the sequence is not Cauchy.

The utility of Cauchy sequences lies in the fact that in a complete metric space (one where all such sequences are known to converge to a limit), the criterion for convergence depends only on the terms of the sequence itself, as opposed to the definition of convergence, which uses the limit value as well as the terms. This is often exploited in algorithms, both theoretical and applied, where an iterative process can be shown relatively easily to produce a Cauchy sequence, consisting of the iterates, thus fulfilling a logical condition, such as termination. 

Generalizations of Cauchy sequences in more abstract uniform spaces exist in the form of Cauchy filters and Cauchy nets.

==In real numbers==
A sequence
formula_5
of real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence if for every positive real number formula_6 there is a positive integer &quot;N&quot; such that for all natural numbers formula_7
formula_8
where the vertical bars denote the absolute value. In a similar way one can define Cauchy sequences of rational or complex numbers. Cauchy formulated such a condition by requiring formula_9 to be infinitesimal for every pair of infinite &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;.

For any real number &quot;r&quot;, the sequence of truncated decimal expansions of &quot;r&quot; forms a Cauchy sequence. For example, when formula_10 this sequence is (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, ...). The &quot;m&quot;th and &quot;n&quot;th terms differ by at most formula_11 when &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and as &quot;m&quot; grows this becomes smaller than any fixed positive number formula_12

===Modulus of Cauchy convergence===

If formula_13 is a sequence in the set formula_14 then a &quot;modulus of Cauchy convergence&quot; for the sequence is a function formula_15 from the set of natural numbers to itself, such that for all natural numbers formula_16 and natural numbers formula_17 formula_18

Any sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is a Cauchy sequence. The existence of a modulus for a Cauchy sequence follows from the well-ordering property of the natural numbers (let formula_19 be the smallest possible formula_20 in the definition of Cauchy sequence, taking formula_21 to be formula_22). The existence of a modulus also follows from the principle of countable choice. &quot;Regular Cauchy sequences&quot; are sequences with a given modulus of Cauchy convergence (usually formula_23 or formula_24). Any Cauchy sequence with a modulus of Cauchy convergence is equivalent to a regular Cauchy sequence; this can be proven without using any form of the axiom of choice.

Moduli of Cauchy convergence are used by constructive mathematicians who do not wish to use any form of choice. Using a modulus of Cauchy convergence can simplify both definitions and theorems in constructive analysis. Regular Cauchy sequences were used by and by in constructive mathematics textbooks.

==In a metric space==

Since the definition of a Cauchy sequence only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space &quot;X&quot;. 
To do so, the absolute value formula_25 is replaced by the distance formula_26 (where &quot;d&quot; denotes a metric) between formula_27 and formula_28

Formally, given a metric space formula_29 a sequence of elements of formula_30
formula_5
is Cauchy, if for every positive real number formula_32 there is a positive integer formula_20 such that for all positive integers formula_7 the distance
formula_35

Roughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to have a limit in &quot;X&quot;. 
Nonetheless, such a limit does not always exist within &quot;X&quot;: the property of a space that every Cauchy sequence converges in the space is called &quot;completeness&quot;, and is detailed below.

==Completeness==
A metric space (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) in which every Cauchy sequence converges to an element of &quot;X&quot; is called complete.

===Examples===
The real numbers are complete under the metric induced by the usual absolute value, and one of the standard constructions of the real numbers involves Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. In this construction, each equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior—that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another— is a real number.

A rather different type of example is afforded by a metric space &quot;X&quot; which has the discrete metric (where any two distinct points are at distance 1 from each other). Any Cauchy sequence of elements of &quot;X&quot; must be constant beyond some fixed point, and converges to the eventually repeating term.

===Non-example: rational numbers===
The rational numbers formula_36 are not complete (for the usual distance):
There are sequences of rationals that converge (in formula_37) to irrational numbers; these are Cauchy sequences having no limit in formula_38 In fact, if a real number &quot;x&quot; is irrational, then the sequence (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;), whose &quot;n&quot;-th term is the truncation to &quot;n&quot; decimal places of the decimal expansion of &quot;x&quot;, gives a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers with irrational limit &quot;x&quot;. Irrational numbers certainly exist in formula_39 for example:

* The sequence defined by formula_40 consists of rational numbers (1, 3/2, 17/12...), which is clear from the definition; however it converges to the irrational square root of 2, see Babylonian method of computing square root.
* The sequence formula_41 of ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers which, if it converges at all, converges to a limit formula_42 satisfying formula_43 and no rational number has this property. If one considers this as a sequence of real numbers, however, it converges to the real number formula_44 the Golden ratio, which is irrational.
* The values of the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(&quot;x&quot;), sin(&quot;x&quot;), cos(&quot;x&quot;), are known to be irrational for any rational value of formula_45 but each can be defined as the limit of a rational Cauchy sequence, using, for instance, the Maclaurin series.

===Non-example: open interval===
The open interval formula_46 in the set of real numbers with an ordinary distance in formula_37 is not a complete space: there is a sequence formula_48 in it, which is Cauchy (for arbitrarily small distance bound formula_49 all terms formula_50 of formula_51 fit in the formula_52 interval), however does not converge in formula_30 — its &#x27;limit&#x27;, number 0, does not belong to the space formula_54

===Other properties===
* Every convergent sequence (with limit &quot;s&quot;, say) is a Cauchy sequence, since, given any real number formula_55 beyond some fixed point, every term of the sequence is within distance formula_56 of &quot;s&quot;, so any two terms of the sequence are within distance formula_21 of each other.
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence formula_50 is bounded (since for some &quot;N&quot;, all terms of the sequence from the &quot;N&quot;-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if &quot;M&quot; is the largest distance between formula_59 and any terms up to the &quot;N&quot;-th, then no term of the sequence has distance greater than formula_60 from formula_59).
* In any metric space, a Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence with limit &quot;s&quot; is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance &quot;r&quot;/2 of &quot;s&quot;, and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance &quot;r&quot;/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance &quot;r&quot; of &quot;s&quot;.

These last two properties, together with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the Heine–Borel theorem. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano–Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. This proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the least upper bound axiom. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of the real numbers as the completion of the rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.

One of the standard illustrations of the advantage of being able to work with Cauchy sequences and make use of completeness is provided by consideration of the summation of an infinite series of real numbers
(or, more generally, of elements of any complete normed linear space, or Banach space). Such a series 
formula_62 is considered to be convergent if and only if the sequence of partial sums formula_63 is convergent, where formula_64 It is a routine matter to determine whether the sequence of partial sums is Cauchy or not, since for positive integers formula_65
formula_66

If formula_67 is a uniformly continuous map between the metric spaces &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; and (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a Cauchy sequence in &quot;M&quot;, then formula_68 is a Cauchy sequence in &quot;N&quot;. If formula_69 and formula_70 are two Cauchy sequences in the rational, real or complex numbers, then the sum formula_71 and the product formula_72 are also Cauchy sequences.

==Generalizations==

===In topological vector spaces===
There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence for a topological vector space formula_30: Pick a local base formula_74 for formula_30 about 0; then (formula_76) is a Cauchy sequence if for each member formula_77 there is some number formula_20 such that whenever 
formula_79 is an element of formula_80 If the topology of formula_30 is compatible with a translation-invariant metric formula_82 the two definitions agree.

===In topological groups===

Since the topological vector space definition of Cauchy sequence requires only that there be a continuous &quot;subtraction&quot; operation, it can just as well be stated in the context of a topological group: A sequence formula_83 in a topological group formula_84 is a Cauchy sequence if for every open neighbourhood formula_85 of the identity in formula_84 there exists some number formula_20 such that whenever formula_88 it follows that formula_89 As above, it is sufficient to check this for the neighbourhoods in any local base of the identity in formula_90

As in the construction of the completion of a metric space, one can furthermore define the binary relation on Cauchy sequences in formula_84 that formula_83 and formula_93 are equivalent if for every open neighbourhood formula_85 of the identity in formula_84 there exists some number formula_20 such that whenever formula_88 it follows that formula_98 This relation is an equivalence relation: It is reflexive since the sequences are Cauchy sequences. It is symmetric since formula_99 which by continuity of the inverse is another open neighbourhood of the identity. It is transitive since formula_100 where formula_101 and formula_102 are open neighbourhoods of the identity such that formula_103; such pairs exist by the continuity of the group operation.

===In groups===

There is also a concept of Cauchy sequence in a group formula_84:
Let formula_105 be a decreasing sequence of normal subgroups of formula_84 of finite index.
Then a sequence formula_69 in formula_84 is said to be Cauchy (with respect to formula_109) if and only if for any formula_110 there is formula_20 such that for all formula_112

Technically, this is the same thing as a topological group Cauchy sequence for a particular choice of topology on formula_113 namely that for which formula_109 is a local base.

The set formula_115 of such Cauchy sequences forms a group (for the componentwise product), and the set formula_116 of null sequences (sequences such that formula_117) is a normal subgroup of formula_118 The factor group formula_119 is called the completion of formula_84 with respect to formula_121

One can then show that this completion is isomorphic to the inverse limit of the sequence formula_122

An example of this construction familiar in number theory and algebraic geometry is the construction of the formula_123-adic completion of the integers with respect to a prime formula_124 In this case, formula_84 is the integers under addition, and formula_126 is the additive subgroup consisting of integer multiples of formula_127 

If formula_109 is a cofinal sequence (that is, any normal subgroup of finite index contains some formula_126), then this completion is canonical in the sense that it is isomorphic to the inverse limit of formula_130 where formula_109 varies over normal subgroups of finite index. For further details, see Ch. I.10 in Lang&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot;.

===In a hyperreal continuum===
A real sequence formula_132 has a natural hyperreal extension, defined for hypernatural values &quot;H&quot; of the index &quot;n&quot; in addition to the usual natural &quot;n&quot;. The sequence is Cauchy if and only if for every infinite &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot;, the values formula_133 and formula_134 are infinitely close, or adequal, that is,
:formula_135 
where &quot;st&quot; is the standard part function.

===Cauchy completion of categories===
 introduced a notion of Cauchy completion of a category. Applied to formula_36 (the category whose objects are rational numbers, and there is a morphism from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; if and only if formula_137), this Cauchy completion yields formula_138 (again interpreted as a category using its natural ordering).

<text>Common Era (CE) and Before the Common Era (BCE) are year notations for the Gregorian calendar (and its predecessor, the Julian calendar), the world&#x27;s most widely used calendar era. Common Era and Before the Common Era are alternatives to the original Anno Domini (AD) and Before Christ (BC) notations used for the same calendar era. The two notation systems are numerically equivalent: &quot;2025 CE&quot; and &quot;AD 2025&quot; each describe the current year; &quot;400 BCE&quot; and &quot;400 BC&quot; are the same year.

The expression can be traced back to 1615, when it first appears in a book by Johannes Kepler as the (), and to 1635 in English as &quot; Era&quot;. The term &quot;Common Era&quot; can be found in English as early as 1708, and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by Jewish religious scholars. Since the late 20th century, BCE and CE have become popular in academic and scientific publications on the grounds that BCE and CE are religiously neutral terms. They have been promoted as more sensitive to non-Christians by not referring to Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, especially via the religious terms &quot;Christ&quot; and (&quot;Lord&quot;) used by the other abbreviations. Nevertheless, its epoch remains the same as that used for the Anno Domini era.
== History ==
=== Origins ===

The idea of numbering years beginning from the date that he believed to be the date of birth of Jesus, was conceived around the year 525 by the Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus. He did this to replace the then dominant Era of Martyrs system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. He numbered years from an initial reference date (&quot;epoch&quot;), an event he referred to as the Incarnation of Jesus. Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as &quot;Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi&quot; (Of the year of our Lord Jesus Christ].

This way of numbering years became more widespread in Europe with its use by Bede in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus, without a year zero. In 1422, Portugal became the last Western European country to switch to the system begun by Dionysius.

=== Vulgar Era ===
The term &quot;Common Era&quot; is traced back in English to its appearance as &quot;Vulgar Era&quot; to distinguish years of the Anno Domini era, which was in popular use, from dates of the regnal year (the year of the reign of a sovereign) typically used in national law.
(The word &#x27;vulgar&#x27; originally meant &#x27;of the ordinary people&#x27;, with no derogatory associations.)

The first use of the Latin term may be that in a 1615 book by Johannes Kepler. Kepler uses it again, as , in a 1616 table of ephemerides, and again, as , in 1617. A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English that may be the earliest-found use of &quot;Vulgar Era&quot; in English. A 1701 book edited by John Le Clerc includes the phrase &quot;Before Christ according to the Vulgar Æra,6&quot;.

The Merriam Webster Dictionary gives 1716 as the date of first use of the term &quot;vulgar era&quot; (which it defines as Christian era). 

The first published use of &quot;Christian Era&quot; may be the Latin phrase on the title page of a 1584 theology book, . In 1649, the Latin phrase appeared in the title of an English almanac. A 1652 ephemeris may be the first instance found so far of the English use of &quot;Christian Era&quot;.

The English phrase &quot;Common Era&quot; appears at least as early as 1708, 
and in a 1715 book on astronomy it is used interchangeably with &quot;Christian Era&quot; and &quot;Vulgar Era&quot;. A 1759 history book uses &quot;common æra&quot; in a generic sense, to refer to &quot;the common era of the Jews&quot;. The first use of the phrase &quot;before the common era&quot; may be that in a 1770 work that also uses &quot;common era&quot; and &quot;vulgar era&quot; as synonyms, in a translation of a book originally written in German. The 1797 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica uses the terms &quot;vulgar era&quot; and &quot;common era&quot; synonymously. 
In 1835, in his book &quot;Living Oracles&quot;, Alexander Campbell, wrote: &quot;The vulgar Era, or Anno Domini; the fourth year of Jesus Christ, the first of which was but eight days&quot;, 
and also refers to the &quot;common era&quot; as a synonym for &quot;vulgar era&quot; with &quot;the fact that our Lord was born on the 4th year before the vulgar era, called Anno Domini, thus making (for example) the 42d year from his birth to correspond with the 38th of the common era&quot;. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1909) in at least one article reports all three terms (Christian, Vulgar, Common Era) being commonly understood by the early 20th century.

The phrase &quot;common era&quot;, in lower case, also appeared in the 19th century in a &quot;generic&quot; sense, not necessarily to refer to the Christian Era, but to any system of dates in common use throughout a civilization. Thus, &quot;the common era of the Jews&quot;, &quot;the common era of the Mahometans&quot;, &quot;common era of the world&quot;, &quot;the common era of the foundation of Rome&quot;. 
When it did refer to the Christian Era, it was sometimes qualified, e.g., &quot;common era of the Incarnation&quot;, &quot;common era of the Nativity&quot;, or &quot;common era of the birth of Christ&quot;.

An adapted translation of &quot;Common Era&quot; into Latin as was adopted in the 20th century by some followers of Aleister Crowley, and thus the abbreviation &quot;e.v.&quot; or &quot;EV&quot; may sometimes be seen as a replacement for AD.

=== History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation ===
Although Jews have their own Hebrew calendar, they often use the Gregorian calendar without the AD prefix. As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar. , Common Era notation has also been in use for Hebrew lessons for more than a century. Jews have also used the term Current Era.

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of theology, education, archaeology and history have adopted CE and BCE notation despite some disagreement. A study conducted in 2014 found that the BCE/CE notation is not growing at the expense of BC and AD notation in the scholarly literature, and that both notations are used in a relatively stable fashion. 

===Australia===
In 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation. The change drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority denied the rumours and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.

===Canada===
In 2013, the Canadian Museum of Civilization (now the Canadian Museum of History) in Gatineau (opposite Ottawa), which had previously switched to BCE/CE, decided to change back to BC/AD in material intended for the public while retaining BCE/CE in academic content.

===Nepal===
The notation is in particularly common use in Nepal in order to disambiguate dates from the local calendar, Bikram or Vikram Sambat. Disambiguation is needed because the era of the local calendar is quite close to the Common Era.

===United Kingdom===
In 2002, an advisory panel for the religious education syllabus for England and Wales recommended introducing BCE/CE dates to schools, and by 2018 some local education authorities were using them. 

In 2018, the National Trust said it would continue to use BC/AD as its house style. English Heritage explains its era policy thus: &quot;It might seem strange to use a Christian calendar system when referring to British prehistory, but the BC/AD labels are widely used and understood.&quot; Some parts of the BBC use BCE/CE, but some presenters have said they will not. As of October 2019, the BBC News style guide has entries for AD and BC, but not for CE or BCE. The style guide for &quot;The Guardian&quot; says, under the entry for CE/BCE: &quot;some people prefer CE (common era, current era, or Christian era) and BCE (before common era, etc.) to AD and BC, which, however, remain our style&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, the use of the BCE/CE notation in textbooks was reported in 2005 to be growing. Some publications have transitioned to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch to BCE/CE, ending a period of 138 years in which the traditional BC/AD dating notation was used. BCE/CE is used by the College Board in its history tests, and by the Norton Anthology of English Literature. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based History Channel uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as Jerusalem and Judaism. The 2006 style guide for the Episcopal Diocese &quot;Maryland Church News&quot; says that BCE and CE should be used.

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state&#x27;s new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of local discretion.

== Rationales ==
=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit &quot;Our Lord&quot; in the abbreviation &quot;AD&quot;. Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord. Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by Christians, but who are not themselves Christian. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has argued:

Adena K. Berkowitz, in her application to argue before the United States Supreme Court, opted to use BCE and CE because, &quot;Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designationsB.C.E. and C.E. cast a wider net of inclusion.&quot; In the World History Encyclopedia, Joshua J. Mark wrote &quot;Non-Christian scholars, especially, embraced [CE and BCE] because they could now communicate more easily with the Christian community. Jewish, Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist scholars could retain their [own] calendar but refer to events using the Gregorian Calendar as BCE and CE without compromising their own beliefs about the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; In &quot;History Today&quot;, Michael Ostling wrote: &quot;BC/AD Dating: In the year of whose Lord? The continuing use of AD and BC is not only factually wrong but also offensive to many who are not Christians.&quot;

=== Opposition ===
Critics note the fact that there is no difference in the epoch of the two systems—chosen to be close to the date of birth of Jesus. Since the year numbers are the same, BCE and CE dates should be equally offensive to other religions as BC and AD. Roman Catholic priest and writer on interfaith issues Raimon Panikkar argued that the BCE/CE usage is the less inclusive option since they are still using the Christian calendar numbers and forcing it on other nations. In 1993, the English-language expert Kenneth G. Wilson speculated a slippery slope scenario in his style guide that, &quot;if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis.&quot;

Some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to Jesus, including the Southern Baptist Convention.

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which still often precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all). Thus, the current year is written as 2025 in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as 2025 CE, or as AD 2025), and the year that Socrates died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with periods (e.g., &quot;B.C.E.&quot; or &quot;C.E.&quot;). The US-based Society of Biblical Literature style guide for academic texts on religion prefers BCE/CE to BC/AD.

== Similar conventions in other languages ==
* In Germany, Jews in Berlin seem to have already been using words translating to &quot;(before the) common era&quot; in the 18th century, while others like Moses Mendelssohn opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society. The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like (before the common chronology). In 1938 Nazi Germany, the use of this convention was also prescribed by the National Socialist Teachers League. However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine found it ironic to see &quot;Aryans following Jewish example nearly 200 years later&quot;.
* In Spanish, common forms used for &quot;BC&quot; are and (for &quot;&quot;, &quot;before Christ&quot;), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of () instead of . The also acknowledges the use of () and (). In scholarly writing, is the equivalent of the English &quot;BCE&quot;, &quot;&quot; or &quot;Before the Common Era&quot;.
* In Welsh, OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD () and CE (); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ) is used exclusively, as would abbreviate to a mild obscenity. 
* In Russian since the October Revolution (1917) , lit. &quot;before our era&quot;) and lit. &quot;of our era&quot;) are used almost universally. Within Christian churches , i.e. &quot;before/after the birth of Christ&quot;, equivalent to ) remains in use.
* In Polish, &quot;p.n.e.&quot; (, lit. &quot;before our era&quot;) and &quot;n.e.&quot; (, lit. &quot;of our era&quot;) are commonly used in historical and scientific literature. (&quot;before Christ&quot;) and (&quot;after Christ&quot;) see sporadic usage, mostly in religious publications.
*In China, upon the foundation of the Republic of China, the Government in Nanking adopted the Republic of China calendar with 1912 designated as year 1, but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was (, &quot;Western Era&quot;), which is still used in Taiwan in formal documents. In 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China adopted (, &quot;Common Era&quot;) for both internal and external affairs in mainland China. This notation was extended to Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999 (de facto extended in 1966) through Annex III of Hong Kong Basic Law and Macau Basic Law, thus eliminating the ROC calendar in these areas. BCE is translated into Chinese as (, &quot;Before the Common Era&quot;).
* In Czech, the &quot;n. l.&quot; ( which translates as &quot;of our year count&quot;) and &quot;př. n. l.&quot; or &quot;před n. l.&quot; ( meaning &quot;before our year count&quot;) is used, always after the year number. The direct translation of AD (, abbreviated as &quot;L. P.&quot;) or BC (, abbreviated as &quot;př. Kr.&quot;) is seen as archaic.
*In Croatian the common form used for &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot; are &quot;pr. Kr.&quot; (&quot;prije Krista&quot;, &quot;before Christ&quot;) and &quot;p. Kr.&quot; (&quot;poslije Krista&quot;, &quot;after Christ&quot;). The abbreviations &quot;pr. n. e.&quot; (&quot;prije nove ere, before new era&quot;) and &quot;n. e. (nove ere, (of the) new era&quot;) have also recently been introduced.
* In Danish, &quot;f.v.t.&quot; (, &quot;before our time reckoning&quot;) and &quot;e.v.t.&quot; (, &quot;after our time reckoning&quot;) are used as BCE/CE are in English. Also commonly used are &quot;f.Kr.&quot; (, &quot;before Christ&quot;) and &quot;e.Kr.&quot; (, &quot;after Christ&quot;), which are both placed after the year number in contrast with BC/AD in English.
* In Macedonian, the terms &quot;п.н.е.&quot; (пред нашата ера &quot;before our era&quot;) and &quot;н.е.&quot; (наша ера &quot;our era&quot;) are used in every aspect.
* In Estonian, &quot;e.m.a.&quot; (, &quot;before our time reckoning&quot;) and &quot;m.a.j.&quot; (, &quot;according to our time reckoning&quot;) are used as BCE and CE, respectively. Also in use are terms &quot;eKr&quot; (, &quot;before Christ&quot;) and &quot;pKr&quot; (, &quot;after Christ&quot;). In all cases, the abbreviation is written after the year number.
* In Finnish, &quot;eaa.&quot; (, &quot;before time reckoning&quot;) and &quot;jaa.&quot; (, &quot;after the start of time reckoning&quot;) are used as BCE and CE, respectively. Also (decreasingly) in use are terms &quot;eKr&quot;, (, &quot;before Christ&quot;) and &quot;jKr&quot;. (, &quot;after Christ&quot;). In all cases, the abbreviation is written after the year number.

<text>Charles Robert Malden (9 August 1797 – 23 May 1855), was a nineteenth-century British naval officer, surveyor and educator. He is the discoverer of Malden Island in the central Pacific, which is named in his honour. He also founded Windlesham House School at Brighton, England.

==Biography==
Malden was born in Putney, Surrey, son of Jonas Malden, a surgeon. He entered British naval service at the age of 11 on 22 June 1809. He served nine years as a volunteer 1st class, midshipman, and shipmate, including one year in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay (1809), four years at the Cape of Good Hope and in the East Indies (1809–14), two and a half years on the North American and West Indian stations (1814–16), and a year and a half in the Mediterranean (1817–18). He was present at the capture of Mauritius and Java, and at the battles of Baltimore and New Orleans.

He passed the examination in the elements of mathematics and the theory of navigation at the Royal Naval Academy on 2–4 September 1816, and became a 1st Lieutenant on 1 September 1818. In eight years of active service as an officer, he served two and a half years in a surveying ship in the Mediterranean (1818–21), one and a half years in a surveying sloop in the English Channel and off the coast of Ireland (1823–24), and one and a half years as Surveyor of the frigate during a voyage (1824–26) to and from the Hawaiian Islands (then known as the &quot;Sandwich islands&quot;).
In Hawaii he surveyed harbours which, he noted, were &quot;said not to exist by Captains Cook and Vancouver.&quot; On the return voyage he discovered and explored uninhabited Malden Island in the central Pacific on 30 July 1825. After his return he left active service but remained at half pay. He served for several years as hydrographer to King William IV.

He married Frances Cole, daughter of Rev. William Hodgson Cole, rector of West Clandon and Vicar of Wonersh, near Guildford, Surrey, on 8 April 1828. Malden became the father of seven sons and a daughter.

From 1830 to 1836 he took pupils for the Royal Navy at Ryde, Isle of Wight. He purchased the school of Henry Worsley at Newport, Isle of Wight, in December 1836, reopened it as a preparatory school on 20 February 1837, and moved it to Montpelier Road in Brighton in December 1837. He built the Windlesham House School at Brighton in 1844, and conducted the school until his death there in 1855. He was succeeded as headmaster by his son Henry Charles Malden.

<text>Chechnya, officially the Chechen Republic, is a republic of Russia. It is situated in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe, between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The republic forms a part of the North Caucasian Federal District, and shares land borders with Georgia to its south; with the Russian republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, and North Ossetia–Alania to its east, north, and west; and with Stavropol Krai to its northwest.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Checheno-Ingush ASSR split into two parts: the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, which declared independence, while the former sided with Russia. Following the First Chechen War of 1994–1996 with Russia, Chechnya gained &quot;de facto&quot; independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, although &quot;de jure&quot; it remained a part of Russia. Russian federal control was restored in the Second Chechen War of 1999–2009, with Chechen politics being dominated by the former Ichkerian mufti Akhmad Kadyrov, and later his son Ramzan Kadyrov.

The republic covers an area of , with a population of over 1.5 million residents . It is home to the indigenous Chechens, part of the Nakh peoples, and of primarily Islamic faith. Grozny is the capital and largest city.

==History==
===Origin of Chechnya&#x27;s population===
According to Leonti Mroveli, the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word &quot;Caucasus&quot; is derived from the Nakh ancestor Kavkas.
According to George Anchabadze of Ilia State University:

American linguist Johanna Nichols &quot;has used language to connect the modern people of the Caucasus region to the ancient farmers of the Fertile Crescent&quot; and her research suggests that &quot;farmers of the region were proto-Nakh-Daghestanians&quot;. Nichols stated: &quot;The Nakh–Dagestanian languages are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to Western civilisation.&quot;

===Prehistory===
Traces of human settlement dating back to 40,000 BC were found near Lake Kezanoi. Cave paintings, artifacts, and other archaeological evidence indicate continuous habitation for some 8,000 years. People living in these settlements used tools, fire, and clothing made of animal skins.

The Caucasian Epipaleolithic and early Caucasian Neolithic era saw the introduction of agriculture, irrigation, and the domestication of animals in the region. Settlements near Ali-Yurt and Magas, discovered in modern times, revealed tools made out of stone: stone axes, polished stones, stone knives, stones with holes drilled in them, clay dishes etc. Settlements made out of clay bricks were discovered in the plains. In the mountains there were settlements made from stone and surrounded by walls; some of them dated back to 8000 BC. This period also saw the appearance of the wheel (3000 BC), horseback riding, metal works (copper, gold, silver, iron), dishes, armor, daggers, knives and arrow tips in the region. The artifacts were found near Nasare-Cort, Muzhichi, Ja-E-Bortz (alternatively known as Surkha-khi), Abbey-Gove (also known as Nazran or Nasare).

===Pre-imperial era===
In the 14th and 15th centuries, there was frequent warfare between the Chechens, Tamerlane and Tokhtamysh, culminating in the Battle of the Terek River (see Tokhtamysh–Timur war). The Chechen tribes built fortresses, castles, and defensive walls, protecting the mountains from the invaders (see Vainakh tower architecture). Part of the lowland tribes were occupied by Mongols. However, during the mid-14th century a strong Chechen Princedom called Simsim emerged under Khour II, a Chechen king that led the Chechen politics and wars. He was in charge of an army of Chechens against the rogue warlord Mamai and defeated him in the Battle of Tatar-tup in 1362. The kingdom of Simsim was almost destroyed during the Timurid invasion of the Caucasus, when Khour II allied himself with the Golden Horde Khan Tokhtamysh in the Battle of the Terek River. Timur sought to punish the highlanders for their allegiance to Tokhtamysh and as a consequence invaded Simsim in 1395.

The 16th century saw the first Russian involvement in the Caucasus. In 1558, Temryuk of Kabarda sent his emissaries to Moscow requesting help from Ivan the Terrible against the Vainakh tribes. Ivan the Terrible married Temryuk&#x27;s daughter Maria Temryukovna. An alliance was formed to gain the ground in the central Caucasus for the expanding Tsardom of Russia against Vainakh defenders.

In 1667 Mehk-Da Aldaman Gheza defended the borders of Chechnya from invasions of Kabardinians and Avars during the Battle of Khachara. The Chechens converted over the next few centuries to Sunni Islam, as Islam was associated with resistance to Russian encroachment.

===Imperial rule===

Russian Emperor Peter the Great first sought to increase Russia&#x27;s political influence in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea at the expense of Safavid Persia when he launched the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723. Russian forces succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Persia for several years.

As the Imperial Russian Army took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian-ruled Dagestan, Peter&#x27;s forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them. In 1732, after Russia had already ceded back most of the Caucasus to Persia, now led by Nader Shah, following the Treaty of Resht, Russian troops clashed again with Chechens in a village called Chechen-aul along the Argun River. The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokchi came to be known as &quot;Chechens&quot; – the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place. However, the name &quot;Chechen&quot; had already been used as early as 1692.

Under intermittent Persian rule since 1555, in 1783, the eastern Georgians of Kartl-Kakheti, led by Erekle II, and the Russians signed the Treaty of Georgievsk. According to this treaty, Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia, and Georgia abjured any dependence on Iran. To increase its influence in the Caucasus and secure communication with Kartli and other Christian-inhabited regions of Transcaucasia, which it considered useful in its wars against Persia and the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire began conquering the Northern Caucasus mountains. The Russian Empire used Christianity to justify its conquests. This allowed Islam to spread widely among the Chechens, as it positioned itself as the religion of liberation from the Tsardom of Russia, which viewed Nakh tribes as &quot;bandits&quot;. The rebellion was led by Mansur Ushurma, a Chechen sheikh belonging to the Naqshbandi Sufi order—with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish an Islamic state based in the Transcaucasus under &quot;Sharia&quot; law. He was unable to fully achieve this because, in the course of the war, he was betrayed by the Ottoman Turks, handed over to the Russians, and executed in 1794.

After Persia was forced to cede the current territories of Dagestan, most of Azerbaijan, and Georgia to Russia following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813 and its resultant Treaty of Gulistan, Russia significantly widened its foothold in the Caucasus at Persia&#x27;s expense. Another successful Caucasus war against Persia several years later, starting in 1826 and ending in 1828 with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, and a successful war against the Ottoman Empire in 1828–1829, enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subduing the natives of the North Caucasus.

The resistance of the Nakh tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-Avar commander, Imam Shamil, who fought against the Russians from 1834 to 1859 (see Murid War). In 1859, Shamil was captured by the Russians at aul Gunib. Shamil left Baysangur of Benoa, a Chechen with one arm, one eye, and one leg, in charge of command at Gunib. Baysangur broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian Tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonization tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands. The Cossacks suffered defeat after defeat and were constantly attacked by mountaineers, who robbed them of food and weaponry.

The Russian Tsarist regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (see Muhajir (Caucasus)). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance, which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen abrek Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and the postal service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed at the beginning of the twentieth century. The war between Nakh tribes and Russia resurfaced during the times of the Russian Revolution, which saw the Nakh struggle against Anton Denikin and later against the Soviet Union.

On 21 December 1917, Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Dagestan declared independence from Russia and formed a single state: the United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus, which was recognized by major world powers of the time. The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (today in Dagestan). Tapa Tchermoeff, a prominent Chechen statesman, was elected the first prime minister of the state. The second prime minister elected was Vassan-Girey Dzhabagiev, an Ingush statesman, who also was the author of the constitution of the republic in 1917, and in 1920 he was re-elected for the third term. In 1921 the Russians attacked and occupied the country and forcibly absorbed it into the Soviet state. The Caucasian war for independence restarted, and the government went into exile.

===Soviet rule===
Under the Soviet Union, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined to form the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the 1930s, Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing a famine. As a result, many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR permanently and survived the famine. Although over 50,000 Chechens and over 12,000 Ingush were fighting against Nazi Germany on the front line (including Heroes of the USSR: Abukhadzhi Idrisov, Khanpasha Nuradilov, Movlid Visaitov), and although Nazi German troops advanced as far as the Ossetian ASSR city of Ordzhonikidze and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR city of Malgobek after capturing half of the Caucasus in less than a month, Chechens and Ingush were falsely accused as Nazi supporters and entire nations were deported during Operation Lentil to the Kazakh SSR (later Kazakhstan) in 1944 near the end of World War II where over 60% of Chechen and Ingush populations perished. American historian Norman Naimark writes:

The deportation was justified by the materials prepared by NKVD officer Bogdan Kobulov accusing Chechens and Ingush in a mass conspiracy preparing rebellion and providing assistance to the German forces. Many of the materials were later proven to be fabricated. Even distinguished Red Army officers who fought bravely against Germans (e.g. the commander of 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush regiment Movlid Visaitov, the first to contact American forces at Elbe river) were deported. There is a theory that the real reason why Chechens and Ingush were deported was the desire of Russia to attack Turkey, an anti-communist country, as Chechens and Ingush could impede such plans. In 2004, the European Parliament recognized the deportation of Chechens and Ingush as an act of genocide.

The territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between Stavropol Krai (where Grozny Okrug was formed), the Dagestan ASSR, the North Ossetian ASSR, and the Georgian SSR.

The Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during de-Stalinisation under Nikita Khrushchev when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored but with both the boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed. There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union, who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its Prigorodny District which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR but gained predominantly Russian Naursky District and Shelkovskoy District that is considered the homeland for Terek Cossacks.

The Russification policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with Russian language proficiency required in many aspects of life to provide Chechens better opportunities for advancement in the Soviet system. On 26 November 1990, the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the &quot;Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic&quot;. This declaration was part of the reorganisation of the Soviet Union. This new treaty was to be signed 22 August 1991, which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. The 19–21 August 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt led to the abandonment of this reorganisation.

With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, the Chechen National Congress, was formed, led by ex-Soviet Air Force general and new Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev. It campaigned for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was opposed by Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s Russian Federation, which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian states such as Georgia had—but was part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede. It also argued that other republics of Russia, such as Tatarstan, would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right. Finally, it argued that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of Russia and hence its secession would hurt the country&#x27;s economy and energy access.

During the Chechen Revolution, the Soviet Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev was overthrown and Dzhokhar Dudayev seized power. On 1 November 1991, Dudaev&#x27;s Chechnya issued a unilateral declaration of independence. In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally.

===Chechen Wars and brief independence===
The First Chechen War, during which Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, took place from 1994 to 1996. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in troops, weaponry, and air support, the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and insurgency raids. The Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in 1995 shocked the Russian public. In April 1996, the first democratically elected president of Chechnya, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was killed by Russian forces using a booby trap bomb and a missile fired from a warplane after he was located by triangulating the position of a satellite phone he was using.

The widespread demoralisation of the Russian Army in the area and a successful offensive to retake Grozny by Chechen rebel forces led by Aslan Maskhadov prompted Russian President Boris Yeltsin to declare a ceasefire in 1996, and sign a peace treaty a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian troops.

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and prime minister in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing the Russian government to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed. Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals. Nearly half a million people (40% of Chechnya&#x27;s prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages. There was an economic downturn. Two Russian brigades were permanently stationed in Chechnya.

In light of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over US$200 million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state, although victims were rarely killed. In 1998, 176 people were kidnapped, 90 of whom were released, according to official accounts. President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on 25 October 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya&#x27;s top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing. Bargishev&#x27;s colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on Salafism and Wahhabism, was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a state of emergency. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

The War of Dagestan began on 7 August 1999, during which the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) began an unsuccessful incursion into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in favor of the Shura of Dagestan, which sought independence from Russia. In September, a series of apartment bombings that killed around 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow, were blamed on Chechen separatists. Some journalists contested the official explanation, instead blaming the Russian secret services for blowing up the buildings to initiate a new military campaign against Chechnya. In response to the bombings, a prolonged air campaign of retaliatory strikes against the Ichkerian regime and a ground offensive that began in October 1999 marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Much better organized and planned than the First Chechen War, the Russian armed forces took control of most regions. The Russian forces used brutal force, killing 60 Chechen civilians during a mop-up operation in Aldy, Chechnya on 5 February 2000. After the re-capture of Grozny in February 2000, the Ichkerian regime fell apart.

===Post-war reconstruction and insurgency===

Chechen separatists continued to fight Russian troops and conduct terror attacks after the occupation of Grozny. In October 2002, 40–50 Chechen rebels seized a Moscow theater and took about 900 civilians hostage. The crisis ended with 117 hostages and up to 50 rebels dead, mostly due to an unknown aerosol pumped into the building by Russian special forces to incapacitate the people inside.

In response to these attacks, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime. In 2003, a referendum was held on a constitution that reintegrated Chechnya within Russia but provided limited autonomy. According to the Chechen government, the referendum passed with 95.5% of the votes and almost 80% turnout. &quot;The Economist&quot; was skeptical of the results, arguing that &quot;few outside the Kremlin regard the referendum as fair&quot;.

In September 2004, separatist rebels occupied a school in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia, demanding recognition of the independence of Chechnya and a Russian withdrawal. 1,100 people (including 777 children) were taken hostage. The attack lasted three days, resulting in the deaths of over 331 people, including 186 children. After the 2004 school siege, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced sweeping security and political reforms, sealing borders in the Caucasus region and revealing plans to give the central government more power. He also vowed to take tougher action against domestic terrorism, including preemptive strikes against Chechen separatists. In 2005 and 2006, separatist leaders Aslan Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev were killed.

Since 2007, Chechnya has been governed by Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov&#x27;s rule has been characterized by high-level corruption, a poor human rights record, widespread use of torture, and a growing cult of personality. Allegations of anti-gay purges in Chechnya were initially reported on 1 April 2017.

In April 2009, Russia ended its counter-terrorism operations and pulled out the bulk of its army. The insurgency in the North Caucasus continued even after this date. The Caucasus Emirate had fully adopted the tenets of a Salafi-jihadist group through its strict adherence to the Sunni Hanbali obedience to the literal interpretation of the Quran and the Sunnah.

The Chechen government has been outspoken in its support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where a Chechen military force, the Kadyrovtsy, which is under Kadyrov&#x27;s personal command, has played a leading role, notably in the Siege of Mariupol. Meanwhile, a substantial number of Chechen separatists have allied themselves to the Ukrainian cause and are fighting a mutual Russian enemy in the Donbas.

==Geography==

Situated in the eastern part of the North Caucasus in Eastern Europe, Chechnya is surrounded on nearly all sides by Russian Federal territory. In the west, it borders North Ossetia and Ingushetia, in the north, Stavropol Krai, in the east, Dagestan, and to the south, Georgia. Its capital is Grozny. Chechnya is well known for being mountainous, but it is in fact split between the more flat areas north of the Terek, and the highlands south of the Terek.

==Administrative divisions==
The Chechen Republic is divided into 15 districts and three cities of republican significance.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 Census, the population of the republic is 1,510,824, up from 1,268,989 in the 2010 Census. As of the 2021 Census, Chechens at 1,456,792 make up 96.4% of the republic&#x27;s population. Other groups include Russians (18,225, or 1.2%), Kumyks (12,184, or 0.8%) and a host of other small groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population. The birth rate was 25.41 in 2004. (25.7 in Achkhoi Martan, 19.8 in Groznyy, 17.5 in Kurchaloi, 28.3 in Urus Martan and 11.1 in Vedeno).

The languages used in the Republic are Chechen and Russian. Chechen belongs to the Vaynakh or North-central Caucasian language family, which also includes Ingush and Batsb. Some scholars place it in a wider North Caucasian languages.

===Life expectancy===

Despite its difficult past, Chechnya has a high life expectancy, one of the highest in Russia. But the pattern of life expectancy is unusual, and in according to numerous statistics, Chechnya stands out from the overall picture. In 2020, Chechnya had the deepest fall in life expectancy, but in 2021 it had the biggest rise. Chechnya has the highest excess of life expectancy in rural areas over cities.

===Religion===
====Islam====

Sunni Islam is the predominant religion in Chechnya, practiced by 95% of those polled in Grozny in 2010. Most of the population is Sunni and follows either the Shafi&#x27;i or the Hanafi schools of Islamic jurisprudence. The Shafi&#x27;i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens, and thus it remains the most practiced. Many Chechens are also Sufis, of either the Qadiri or Naqshbandi orders.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been an Islamic revival in Chechnya, and in 2011 it was estimated that there were 465 mosques, including the Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque in Grozny accommodating 10,000 worshippers, as well 31 madrasas, including an Islamic university named Kunta-haji, the Kurchaloy Islamic Institute named Akhmad Kadyrov, and the Center of Islamic Medicine in Grozny, which is the largest such institution in Europe. A supreme Islamic administrative territorial organisation in Chechnya is the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the Chechen Republic or the Muftiate of the Chechen Republic.

====Christianity====


From the 11th to 13th centuries (i.e. before Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia), there was a mission of Georgian Orthodox missionaries to the Nakh peoples. Their success was limited, though a couple of highland teips did convert to Christianity (conversion was largely by teips). However, during the Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia, these Christianized teips gradually reverted to Paganism, perhaps due to the loss of Transcaucasian contacts, as the Georgians fought the Mongols and briefly fell under their dominion.

The once-strong Russian minority in Chechnya, mostly Terek Cossacks and estimated as numbering approximately 25,000 in 2012, are predominantly Russian Orthodox, although currently only one church exists in Grozny. In August 2011, Archbishop Zosima of Vladikavkaz and Makhachkala performed the first mass baptism ceremony in the history of the Chechen Republic in the Terek River of Naursky District, in which 35 citizens of Naursky and Shelkovsky districts were converted to Russian Orthodoxy. As of 2020, there are eight Eastern Orthodox churches in Chechnya, the largest is the temple of the Archangel Michael in Grozny.

==Politics==
Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Chechnya has enjoyed a period of relative stability under the Russian-appointed government, although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on 2 April 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held on 23 March 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional teips, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.

In the 2024 Russian presidential election, which critics called rigged and fraudulent, Russian President Vladimir Putin won 98.99% of the vote in Chechnya.

===Regional government===
The former separatist religious leader (mufti) Akhmad Kadyrov was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on 5 October 2003. Incidents of ballot stuffing and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors. On 9 May 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a landmine explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and Sergey Abramov was appointed acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 Ramzan Kadyrov (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia (the Kadyrovites). The militia, which began as his father&#x27;s security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch.

===Separatist government===
Ichkeria was a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation between 1991 and 2010. Former president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the Georgian Civil War, recognized the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993. Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognised Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the Taliban government on 16 January 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001. However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria—Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate. Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists, and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU.

The president of this government was Aslan Maskhadov, and the foreign minister was Ilyas Akhmadov, who was the spokesman for the president. Maskhadov had been elected for four years in an internationally monitored election in 1997, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001, he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offenses in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the Second Chechen War. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on 8 March 2005, and the assassination was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. Akhmed Zakayev, deputy prime minister and a foreign minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in England. He and others chose Abdul Khalim Saidullayev, a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On 17 June 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in the Chechen town of Argun. On 10 July 2006, Shamil Basayev, a leader of the Chechen rebel movement, was killed in a truck explosion during an arms deal.

The successor of Saidullayev became Doku Umarov. On 31 October 2007, Umarov abolished the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the Caucasus Emirate with himself as its Emir. This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian parliament voted to recognize the &quot;Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation&quot;.

==Human rights==


Тhe Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reports that after hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and separatist conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.

Нuman rights organizations criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military. In 2006, Human Rights Watch reported that pro-Russian Chechen forces under the command of Ramzan Kadyrov, as well as Russian federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. &quot;If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable&quot;, said Holly Cartner, Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of the Human Rights Watch.

In 2009, the U. S. government-financed American organization Freedom House included Chechnya in the &quot;Worst of the Worst&quot; list of most repressive societies in the world, together with Burma, North Korea, Tibet, and others. Memorial considers Chechnya under Kadyrov to be a totalitarian regime.

On February 1 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov&#x27;s inner circle, 27-year-old Umar Israilov.

On July 1 2009, Amnesty International released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the Russian Federation against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.

On 10 March 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that since Chechenization, the government has pushed for enforced Islamic dress code. The president Ramzan Kadyrov is quoted as saying &quot;I have the right to criticize my wife. She doesn&#x27;t [have the right to criticize me]. With us [in Chechen society], a wife is a housewife. A woman should know her place. A woman should give her love to us [men]... She would be [man&#x27;s] property. And the man is the owner. Here, if a woman does not behave properly, her husband, father, and brother are responsible. According to our tradition, if a woman fools around, her family members kill her... That&#x27;s how it happens, a brother kills his sister or a husband kills his wife... As a president, I cannot allow for them to kill. So, let women not wear shorts...&quot;. He has also openly defended honor killings on several occasions.

On 9 July 2017, Russian newspaper reported that a number of people were extrajudicially executed on the night of 26 January 2017. It published a list of 27 names of the people known to be dead, but stressed that the list is &quot;not all [of those killed]&quot;; the newspaper asserted that 50 people may have been executed. Some of the dead were gay, but not all. The killings appeared to have been precipitated by the death of a policeman; according to the author of the report, Elena Milashina, the victims were executed for engaging in terrorism.

In December 2021, up to 50 family members of critics of the Kadyrov government were abducted in a wave of mass kidnappings beginning on 22 December. In a case-study published during the same year, Freedom House reported that Kadyrov also conducts a total transnational repression campaign against Chechen exiles outside of Russia, including assassinations of critics and digital intimidation.

===LGBT rights===

Although homosexuality is officially legal in Chechnya per Russian law, it is de facto illegal. Chechen authorities have reportedly arrested, imprisoned and killed persons based on their perceived sexual orientation.

In 2017, it was reported by and human rights groups that Chechen authorities had set up concentration camps, one of which is in Argun, where gay men are interrogated and subjected to physical violence. On 27 June 2018, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe noted &quot;cases of abduction, arbitrary detention, and torture ... with the direct involvement of Chechen law enforcement officials and on the orders of top-level Chechen authorities&quot; and expressed dismay &quot;at the statements of Chechen and Russian public officials denying the existence of LGBTI people in the Chechen Republic&quot;. Kadyrov&#x27;s spokesman Alvi Karimov told Interfax that gay people &quot;simply do not exist in the republic&quot; and made an approving reference to honor killings by family members &quot;if there were such people in Chechnya&quot;. In a 2021 Council of Europe report into anti-LGBTI hate-crimes, rapporteur Foura ben Chikha described the &quot;state-sponsored attacks carried out against LGBTI people in Chechnya in 2017&quot; as &quot;the single most egregious example of violence against LGBTI people in Europe that has occurred in decades&quot;.

On 11 January 2019, it was reported that another &quot;gay purge&quot; had begun in the country in December 2018, with several men and women being detained. The Russian LGBT Network believes that around 40 people were detained and two killed.

==Economy==

During the First Chechen War, the Chechen economy fell apart. In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but the change did not occur due to the re-taking of Chechnya by Russian troops in the Second Chechen War.

The economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.

Chechnya&#x27;s unemployment was 67% in 2006 and fell to 21.5% in 2014.

Total revenue of the budget of Chechnya for 2017 was 59.2 billion rubles. Of these, 48.5 billion rubles were grants from the federal budget of the Russian Federation.

In late 1970s, Chechnya produced up to 20 million tons of oil annually, production declined sharply to approximately 3 million tons in the late 1980s, and to below 2 million tons before 1994, first (1994–1996) second Russian invasion of Chechnya (1999) inflicted material damage on the oil-sector infrastructure, oil production decreased to 750,000 tons in 2001 only to increase to 2 million tons in 2006, by 2012 production was 1 million tons.

==Culture==
The culture of Chechnya is based on the native traditions of Chechen people. Chechen mythology along with art have helped shape the culture for over 1,000 years.

From April 2024, all music must have a tempo between 80 and 116 beats per minute, to comply with Chechen traditions. Borrowing musical culture from other peoples is not allowed.

<text>Canonization is the declaration of a deceased person as an officially recognized saint, specifically, the official act of a Christian communion declaring a person worthy of public veneration and entering their name in the canon catalogue of saints, or authorized list of that communion&#x27;s recognized saints.

==Catholic Church==

Canonization is a papal declaration that the Catholic faithful may venerate a particular deceased member of the church. Popes began making such decrees in the tenth century. Up to that point, the local bishops governed the veneration of holy men and women within their own dioceses; and there may have been, for any particular saint, no formal decree at all. In subsequent centuries, the procedures became increasingly regularized and the Popes began restricting to themselves the right to declare someone a Catholic saint. In contemporary usage, the term is understood to refer to the act by which any Christian church declares that a person who has died is a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the list of recognized saints, called the &quot;canon&quot;.

=== Biblical roots ===
In the Roman Martyrology, the following entry is given for the Penitent Thief: &quot;At Jerusalem, the commemoration of the good Thief, who confessed Christ on the cross, and deserved to hear from Him these words: &#x27;This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise.&#x27;

=== Historical development ===
The Roman Canon, the historical Eucharistic Prayer or Anaphora of Canon of the Roman Rite contains only the names of apostles and martyrs, along with that of the Blessed Virgin Mary and, since 1962, that of Saint Joseph her spouse.

By the fourth century, however, &quot;confessors&quot;—people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life—began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint Hilarion and Saint Ephrem the Syrian in the East, and Saint Martin of Tours and Saint Hilary of Poitiers in the West. Their names were inserted in the diptychs, the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the liturgy, and their tombs were honoured in like manner as those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local bishop. This process is often referred to as &quot;local canonization&quot;.

This approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the Donatist heresy, Saint Optatus recounts that at Carthage a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the relics of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint Cyprian (died 258) recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.

Augustine of Hippo (died 430) tells of the procedure which was followed in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity. The acts of the process were sent either to the metropolitan or primate, who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the suffragan bishops, declared whether the deceased was worthy of the name of &quot;martyr&quot; and public veneration.

Though not &quot;canonizations&quot; in the narrow sense, acts of formal recognition, such as the erection of an altar over the saint&#x27;s tomb or transferring the saint&#x27;s relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the person&#x27;s life and the miracles attributed to that person&#x27;s intercession.

Such acts of recognition of a saint were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the diocese or ecclesiastical province for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.

=== Nature ===
In the Catholic Church, both in the Latin and the constituent Eastern churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the Apostolic See and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that they are worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church&#x27;s official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in Heaven and that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the liturgy of the Church, including in the Litany of the Saints.

In the Catholic Church, canonization is a decree that allows universal veneration of the saint. For permission to venerate merely locally, only beatification is needed.

=== Procedure prior to reservation to the Apostolic See ===
For several centuries the bishops, or in some places only the primates and patriarchs, could grant martyrs and confessors public ecclesiastical honor; such honor, however, was always decreed only for the local territory of which the grantors had jurisdiction. Only acceptance of the &quot;cultus&quot; by the Pope made the &quot;cultus&quot; universal, because he alone can rule the universal Catholic Church. Abuses, however, crept into this discipline, due as well to indiscretions of popular fervor as to the negligence of some bishops in inquiring into the lives of those whom they permitted to be honoured as saints.

In the Medieval West, the Apostolic See was asked to intervene in the question of canonizations so as to ensure more authoritative decisions. The canonization of Saint Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg by Pope John XV in 993 was the first undoubted example of papal canonization of a saint from outside of Rome being declared worthy of liturgical veneration for the entire church. 

Thereafter, recourse to the judgment of the Pope occurred more frequently. Toward the end of the 11th century, the Popes began asserting their exclusive right to authorize the veneration of a saint against the older rights of bishops to do so for their dioceses and regions. Popes therefore decreed that the virtues and miracles of persons proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more specifically in general councils. Pope Urban II, Pope Calixtus II, and Pope Eugene III conformed to this discipline.

=== Exclusive reservation to the Apostolic See ===

Hugh de Boves, Archbishop of Rouen, canonized Walter of Pontoise, or St. Gaultier, in 1153, the final saint in Western Europe to be canonized by an authority other than the Pope: &quot;The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of St. Gaultier, or Gaucher, [A]bbot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen. A decree of Pope Alexander III [in] 1170 gave the prerogative to the [P]ope thenceforth, so far as the Western Church was concerned.&quot; In a decretal of 1173, Pope Alexander III reprimanded some bishops for permitting veneration of a man who was merely killed while intoxicated, prohibited veneration of the man, and most significantly decreed that &quot;you shall not therefore presume to honor him in the future; for, even if miracles were worked through him, it is not lawful for you to venerate him as a saint without the authority of the Catholic Church.&quot; Theologians disagree as to the full import of the decretal of Pope Alexander III: either a new law was instituted, in which case the Pope then for the first time reserved the right of beatification to himself, or an existing law was confirmed.

However, the procedure initiated by the decretal of Pope Alexander III was confirmed by a bull of Pope Innocent III issued on the occasion of the canonization of Cunigunde of Luxembourg in 1200. The bull of Pope Innocent III resulted in increasingly elaborate inquiries to the Apostolic See concerning canonizations. Because the decretal of Pope Alexander III did not end all controversy and some bishops did not obey it in so far as it regarded beatification, the right of which they had certainly possessed hitherto, Pope Urban VIII issued the Apostolic letter &quot;Caelestis Hierusalem cives&quot; of 5 July 1634 that exclusively reserved to the Apostolic See both its immemorial right of canonization and that of beatification. He further regulated both of these acts by issuing his &quot;Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum&quot; on 12 March 1642.

=== Procedure from 1734 to 1738 to 1983 ===

In his &quot;De Servorum Dei beatificatione et de Beatorum canonizatione&quot; of five volumes the eminent canonist Prospero Lambertini (1675–1758), who later became Pope Benedict XIV, elaborated on the procedural norms of Pope Urban VIII&#x27;s Apostolic letter &quot;Caelestis Hierusalem cives&quot; of 1634 and &quot;Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum&quot; of 1642, and on the conventional practice of the time. His work published from 1734 to 1738 governed the proceedings until 1917. The article &quot;Beatification and canonization process in 1914&quot; describes the procedures followed until the promulgation of the &quot;Codex&quot; of 1917. The substance of &quot;De Servorum Dei beatifιcatione et de Beatorum canonizatione&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot; (&quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;) of 1917, which governed until the promulgation of the revised &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot; in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. Prior to promulgation of the revised &quot;Codex&quot; in 1983, Pope Paul VI initiated a simplification of the procedures.

=== Since 1983 ===
The Apostolic constitution &quot;Divinus Perfectionis Magister&quot; of Pope John Paul II of 25 January 1983 and the norms issued by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 7 February 1983 to implement the constitution in dioceses, continued the simplification of the process initiated by Pope Paul VI. Contrary to popular belief, the reforms did not eliminate the office of the Promoter of the Faith (Latin: &quot;Promotor Fidei&quot;), popularly known as the Devil&#x27;s advocate, whose office is to question the material presented in favor of canonization. The reforms were intended to reduce the adversarial nature of the process. In November 2012 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Monsignor Carmello Pellegrino as Promoter of the Faith.

Candidates for canonization undergo the following process:
Canonization is a statement of the Church that the person certainly enjoys the beatific vision of Heaven. The title of &quot;Saint&quot; (Latin: &quot;Sanctus&quot; or &quot;Sancta&quot;) is then proper, reflecting that the saint is a refulgence of the holiness (&quot;sanctitas&quot;) of God himself, which alone comes from God&#x27;s gift. The saint is assigned a feast day which may be celebrated anywhere in the universal Church, although it is not necessarily added to the General Roman Calendar or local calendars as an &quot;obligatory&quot; feast; parish churches may be erected in their honor; and the faithful may freely celebrate and honor the saint.

Although recognition of sainthood by the Pope does not directly concern a fact of Divine revelation, nonetheless it must be &quot;definitively held&quot; by the faithful as &quot;infallible&quot; pursuant to, at the least, the Universal Magisterium of the Church, because it is a truth related to revelation by historical necessity.

=== Equipollent canonization ===

Popes have several times permitted to the universal Church, without executing the ordinary judicial process of canonization described above, the veneration as a saint, the &quot;cultus&quot; of one long venerated as such locally. This act of a Pope is denominated &quot;equipollent&quot; or &quot;equivalent canonization&quot; and &quot;confirmation of &quot;cultus&quot;&quot;. In such cases, there is no need to have a miracle attributed to the saint to allow their canonization. According to the rules Pope Benedict XIV (&quot;regnat&quot; 17 August 1740 – 3 May 1758) instituted, there are three conditions for an equipollent canonization: (1) existence of an ancient &quot;cultus&quot; of the person, (2) a general and constant attestation to the virtues or martyrdom of the person by credible historians, and (3) uninterrupted fame of the person as a worker of miracles.

==Protestant denominations==
The majority of Protestant denominations do not formally recognize saints because the Bible uses the term in a way that suggests all Christians are saints. However, some denominations do, as shown below.

=== Anglican Communion ===

The Church of England, the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, canonized Charles I as a saint, in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660.

=== United Methodist Church ===
The General Conference of the United Methodist Church has formally declared individuals &quot;martyrs&quot;, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer (in 2008) and Martin Luther King Jr. (in 2012).

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==


Various terms are used for canonization by the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches: канонизация (&quot;canonization&quot;) or прославление (&quot;glorification&quot;, in the Russian Orthodox Church), კანონიზაცია (&quot;kanonizats’ia&quot;, Georgian Orthodox Church), канонизација (Serbian Orthodox Church), &quot;canonizare&quot; (Romanian Orthodox Church), and Канонизация (Bulgarian Orthodox Church). Additional terms are used for canonization by other autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches: (Katharevousa: ) &quot;agiokatataxi/agiokatataxis&quot;, &quot;ranking among saints&quot; (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Church of Cyprus, Church of Greece), &quot;kanonizim&quot; (Albanian Orthodox Church), &quot;kanonizacja&quot; (Polish Orthodox Church), and &quot;kanonizace/kanonizácia&quot; (Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church).

The Orthodox Church in America, an Eastern Orthodox Church partly recognized as autocephalous, uses the term &quot;glorification&quot; for the official recognition of a person as a saint.

== Oriental Orthodox Church ==

Within the Armenian Apostolic Church, part of Oriental Orthodoxy, there had been discussions since the 1980s about canonizing the victims of the Armenian genocide. On 23 April 2015, all of the victims of the genocide were canonized.

<text>In organic chemistry, a carboxylic acid is an organic acid that contains a carboxyl group () attached to an R-group. The general formula of a carboxylic acid is often written as &#x27; or &#x27;, sometimes as with R referring to an organyl group (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, aryl), or hydrogen, or other groups. Carboxylic acids occur widely. Important examples include the amino acids and fatty acids. Deprotonation of a carboxylic acid gives a carboxylate anion.

==Examples and nomenclature==
Carboxylic acids are commonly identified by their trivial names. They often have the suffix &quot;-ic acid&quot;. IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an &quot;-oic acid&quot; suffix. For example, butyric acid () is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. For nomenclature of complex molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain even if there are other substituents, such as 3-chloropropanoic acid. Alternately, it can be named as a &quot;carboxy&quot; or &quot;carboxylic acid&quot; substituent on another parent structure, such as 2-carboxyfuran.

The carboxylate anion ( or ) of a carboxylic acid is usually named with the suffix &quot;-ate&quot;, in keeping with the general pattern of &quot;-ic acid&quot; and &quot;-ate&quot; for a conjugate acid and its conjugate base, respectively. For example, the conjugate base of acetic acid is acetate.

Carbonic acid, which occurs in bicarbonate buffer systems in nature, is not generally classed as one of the carboxylic acids, despite that it has a moiety that looks like a COOH group. 


==Physical properties==

===Solubility===
Carboxylic acids are polar. Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl ) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl ), they also participate in hydrogen bonding. Together, the hydroxyl and carbonyl group form the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimers in nonpolar media due to their tendency to &quot;self-associate&quot;. Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas bigger carboxylic acids have limited solubility due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols. Aqueous sodium hydroxide and carboxylic acids, even hydrophobic ones, react to yield water-soluble sodium salts. For example, enanthic acid has a low solubility in water (0.2 g/L), but its sodium salt is very soluble in water.

===Boiling points===
Carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, because of their greater surface areas and their tendency to form stabilized dimers through hydrogen bonds. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporized, increasing the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.

===Acidity===
Carboxylic acids are Brønsted–Lowry acids because they are proton (H+) donors. They are the most common type of organic acid.

Carboxylic acids are typically weak acids, meaning that they only partially dissociate into  cations and  anions in neutral aqueous solution. For example, at room temperature, in a 1-molar solution of acetic acid, only 0.001% of the acid are dissociated (i.e. 10−5 moles out of 1 mol). Electron-withdrawing substituents, such as -CF3 group, give stronger acids (the p&quot;K&quot;a of acetic acid is 4.76 whereas trifluoroacetic acid, with a trifluoromethyl substituent, has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 0.23). Electron-donating substituents give weaker acids (the p&quot;K&quot;a of formic acid is 3.75 whereas acetic acid, with a methyl substituent, has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 4.76)

Deprotonation of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are resonance stabilized, because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms, increasing the stability of the anion. Each of the carbon–oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character. The carbonyl carbon&#x27;s partial positive charge is also weakened by the -1/2 negative charges on the 2 oxygen atoms.

===Odour===
Carboxylic acids often have strong sour odours. Esters of carboxylic acids tend to have fruity, pleasant odours, and many are used in perfume.

=== Characterization ===
Carboxylic acids are readily identified as such by infrared spectroscopy. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C=O carbonyl bond (&quot;ν&quot;C=O) between 1680 and 1725 cm−1. A characteristic &quot;ν&quot;O–H band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000 cm−1 region. By 1H NMR spectrometry, the hydroxyl hydrogen appears in the 10–13 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.

==Occurrence and applications==
Many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also frequently found in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.

Carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), acrylic and methacrylic acids (precursors to polymers, adhesives), adipic acid (polymers), citric acid (a flavor and preservative in food and beverages), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (chelating agent), fatty acids (coatings), maleic acid (polymers), propionic acid (food preservative), terephthalic acid (polymers). Important carboxylate salts are soaps.

==Synthesis==

===Industrial routes===
In general, industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on a smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.
* Carbonylation of alcohols as illustrated by the Cativa process for the production of acetic acid. Formic acid is prepared by a different carbonylation pathway, also starting from methanol.
* Oxidation of aldehydes with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts. The required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by hydroformylation.
* Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air. For simple alkanes, this method is inexpensive but not selective enough to be useful. Allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene ring are oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length. Benzoic acid from toluene, terephthalic acid from &quot;para&quot;-xylene, and phthalic acid from &quot;ortho&quot;-xylene are illustrative large-scale conversions. Acrylic acid is generated from propene.
* Oxidation of ethene using silicotungstic acid catalyst.
* Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.
* Carbonylation coupled to the addition of water. This method is effective and versatile for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary carbocations, e.g. isobutylene to pivalic acid. In the Koch reaction, the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes or alkynes is catalyzed by strong acids. Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and CO. Such reactions are sometimes called &quot;Reppe chemistry.&quot;
* Hydrolysis of triglycerides obtained from plant or animal oils. These methods of synthesizing some long-chain carboxylic acids are related to soap making.
* Fermentation of ethanol. This method is used in the production of vinegar.
* The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction provides a route to salicylic acid, precursor to aspirin.

===Laboratory methods===
Preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.
* Oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes with strong oxidants such as potassium dichromate, Jones reagent, potassium permanganate, or sodium chlorite. The method is more suitable for laboratory conditions than the industrial use of air, which is &quot;greener&quot; because it yields less inorganic side products such as chromium or manganese oxides.
* Oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozonolysis, potassium permanganate, or potassium dichromate.
* Hydrolysis of nitriles, esters, or amides, usually with acid- or base-catalysis.
* Carbonation of a Grignard reagent and organolithium reagents:
:
* Halogenation followed by hydrolysis of methyl ketones in the haloform reaction
* Base-catalyzed cleavage of non-enolizable ketones, especially aryl ketones:

===Less-common reactions===
Many reactions produce carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest.
* Disproportionation of an aldehyde in the Cannizzaro reaction
* Rearrangement of diketones in the benzilic acid rearrangement
* Involving the generation of benzoic acids are the von Richter reaction from nitrobenzenes and the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction from phenols.

==Reactions==

===Acid-base reactions===
Carboxylic acids react with bases to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (–OH) group is replaced with a metal cation. For example, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, carbon dioxide, and water:

===Conversion to esters, amides, anhydrides===
Widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters, amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols. 
Their conversion to esters is widely used, e.g. in the production of polyesters. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of amino acids into peptides is a significant biochemical process that requires ATP.

Converting a carboxylic acid to an amide is possible, but not straightforward. Instead of acting as a nucleophile, an amine will react as a base in the presence of a carboxylic acid to give the ammonium carboxylate salt. Heating the salt to above 100 °C will drive off water and lead to the formation of the amide. This method of synthesizing amides is industrially important, and has laboratory applications as well. In the presence of a strong acid catalyst, carboxylic acids can condense to form acid anhydrides. The condensation produces water, however, which can hydrolyze the anhydride back to the starting carboxylic acids. Thus, the formation of the anhydride via condensation is an equilibrium process.

Under acid-catalyzed conditions, carboxylic acids will react with alcohols to form esters via the Fischer esterification reaction, which is also an equilibrium process. Alternatively, diazomethane can be used to convert an acid to an ester. While esterification reactions with diazomethane often give quantitative yields, diazomethane is only useful for forming methyl esters.

=== Reduction ===
Like esters, most carboxylic acids can be reduced to alcohols by hydrogenation, or using hydride transferring agents such as lithium aluminium hydride. Strong alkyl transferring agents, such as organolithium compounds but not Grignard reagents, will reduce carboxylic acids to ketones along with transfer of the alkyl group.

The Vilsmaier reagent (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-Dimethyl(chloromethylene)ammonium chloride; ) is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activates the carboxylic acid to give the carboxymethyleneammonium salt, which can be reduced by a mild reductant like lithium tris(&quot;t&quot;-butoxy)aluminum hydride to afford an aldehyde in a one pot procedure. This procedure is known to tolerate reactive carbonyl functionalities such as ketone as well as moderately reactive ester, olefin, nitrile, and halide moieties.

===Conversion to acyl halides===
The hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to thioesters. Thionyl chloride can be used to convert carboxylic acids to their corresponding acyl chlorides. First, carboxylic acid 1 attacks thionyl chloride, and chloride ion leaves. The resulting oxonium ion 2 is activated towards nucleophilic attack and has a good leaving group, setting it apart from a normal carboxylic acid. In the next step, 2 is attacked by chloride ion to give tetrahedral intermediate 3, a chlorosulfite. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses with the loss of sulfur dioxide and chloride ion, giving protonated acyl chloride 4. Chloride ion can remove the proton on the carbonyl group, giving the acyl chloride 5 with a loss of HCl.

Phosphorus(III) chloride (PCl3) and phosphorus(V) chloride (PCl5) will also convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, by a similar mechanism. One equivalent of PCl3 can react with three equivalents of acid, producing one equivalent of H3PO3, or phosphorus acid, in addition to the desired acid chloride. PCl5 reacts with carboxylic acids in a 1:1 ratio, and produces phosphorus(V) oxychloride (POCl3) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) as byproducts.

===Reactions with carbanion equivalents===
Carboxylic acids react with Grignard reagents and organolithiums to form ketones. The first equivalent of nucleophile acts as a base and deprotonates the acid. A second equivalent will attack the carbonyl group to create a geminal alkoxide dianion, which is protonated upon workup to give the hydrate of a ketone. Because most ketone hydrates are unstable relative to their corresponding ketones, the equilibrium between the two is shifted heavily in favor of the ketone. For example, the equilibrium constant for the formation of acetone hydrate from acetone is only 0.002. The carboxylic group is the most acidic in organic compounds.

===Specialized reactions===
* As with all carbonyl compounds, the protons on the α-carbon are labile due to keto–enol tautomerization. Thus, the α-carbon is easily halogenated in the Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky halogenation.
* The Schmidt reaction converts carboxylic acids to amines.
* Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the Hunsdiecker reaction.
* The Dakin–West reaction converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone.
* In the Barbier–Wieland degradation, a carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain having a simple methylene bridge at the alpha position can have the chain shortened by one carbon. The inverse procedure is the Arndt–Eistert synthesis, where an acid is converted into acyl halide, which is then reacted with diazomethane to give one additional methylene in the aliphatic chain.
* Many acids undergo oxidative decarboxylation. Enzymes that catalyze these reactions are known as carboxylases (EC 6.4.1) and decarboxylases (EC 4.1.1).
* Carboxylic acids are reduced to aldehydes via the ester and DIBAL, via the acid chloride in the Rosenmund reduction and via the thioester in the Fukuyama reduction.
* In ketonic decarboxylation carboxylic acids are converted to ketones.
* Organolithium reagents (&gt;2 equiv) react with carboxylic acids to give a dilithium 1,1-diolate, a stable tetrahedral intermediate which decomposes to give a ketone upon acidic workup.
* The Kolbe electrolysis is an electrolytic, decarboxylative dimerization reaction. It gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid molecules, and joins the remaining fragments together.

==Carboxyl radical==
The carboxyl radical, •COOH, only exists briefly. The acid dissociation constant of •COOH has been measured using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The carboxyl group tends to dimerise to form oxalic acid.

<text>Chernobyl, also known as Chornobyl, is a partially abandoned city in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, situated in the Vyshhorod Raion of northern Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine. Chernobyl is about north of Kyiv, and southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel. Before its evacuation, the city had about 14,000 residents (considerably less than neighboring Pripyat). While living anywhere within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is technically illegal today, authorities tolerate those who choose to live within some of the less irradiated areas, and an estimated 150 people live in Chernobyl in 2020.

First mentioned as a ducal hunting lodge in 1193, the city has changed hands multiple times over the course of history. Jews moved into the city in the 16th century, and a now-defunct monastery was established in the area in 1626. By the end of the 18th century, Chernobyl was a major centre of Hasidic Judaism under the Twersky Dynasty, which left Chernobyl after the city was subjected to pogroms in the early 20th century. The Jewish community was later murdered during the Holocaust. Chernobyl was chosen as the site of Ukraine&#x27;s first nuclear power plant in 1972, located north of the city, which opened in 1977. Chernobyl was evacuated on 5 May 1986, nine days after a catastrophic nuclear disaster at the plant, which was the largest nuclear disaster in history. Along with the residents of the nearby city of Pripyat, which was built as a home for the plant&#x27;s workers, the population was relocated to the newly built city of Slavutych, and most have never returned.
The city was the administrative centre of Chernobyl Raion (district) from 1923. After the disaster, in 1988, the raion was dissolved and administration was transferred to the neighbouring Ivankiv Raion. The raion was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven. The area of Ivankiv Raion was merged into Vyshhorod Raion.

Although Chernobyl is primarily a ghost town today, a small number of people still live there, in houses marked with signs that read, &quot;Owner of this house lives here&quot;, and a small number of animals live there as well. Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are also stationed in the city. The city has two general stores and a hotel.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chernobyl was temporarily captured and occupied by Russian forces between 24 February and 2 April. After its capture, it was reported that radiation levels temporarily rose, due to human activities, including earthworks, which disturbed the dust.

==Name==

The city&#x27;s name is the same as one of the Ukrainian names for &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot;, mugwort or common wormwood: (or more commonly , &#x27;common artemisia&#x27;). The name is inherited from or , a compound of + , the parts related to and , &#x27;stalk&#x27;, so named in distinction to the lighter-stemmed wormwood &quot;A. absinthium&quot;.

The name in languages used nearby is:
* , 

The name in languages formerly used in the area is:
* , .
In English, the Russian-derived spelling &quot;Chernobyl&quot; has been commonly used, but some style guides recommend the spelling &quot;Chornobyl&quot;, or the use of romanized Ukrainian names for Ukrainian places generally.

==History==

The Polish Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland of 1880–1902 states that the time the city was founded is not known.

===Identity of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Azagarium&quot;===
Some older geographical dictionaries and descriptions of modern Eastern Europe mention &quot;Czernobol&quot; (Chernobyl) with reference to Ptolemy&#x27;s world map (2nd century AD). Czernobol is identified as &quot;oppidium Sarmatiae&quot; (Lat., &quot;a city in Sarmatia&quot;), by the 1605 &quot;Lexicon geographicum&quot; of Filippo Ferrari and the 1677 &quot;Lexicon Universale&quot; of Johann Jakob Hofmann. According to the &quot;Dictionary of Ancient Geography&quot; of Alexander Macbean (London, 1773), Azagarium is &quot;a town of Sarmatia Europaea, on the Borysthenes&quot; (Dnieper), 36° East longitude and 50°40&#x27; latitude. The city is &quot;now supposed to be &quot;Czernobol&quot;, a town of Poland, in Red Russia [Red Ruthenia], in the Palatinate of Kiow [Kiev Voivodeship], not far from the Borysthenes.&quot;

Whether Azagarium is indeed Czernobol is debatable. The question of Azagarium&#x27;s correct location was raised in 1842 by Habsburg-Slovak historian, Pavel Jozef Šafárik, who published a book titled &quot;Slavic Ancient History&quot; (&quot;Sławiańskie starożytności&quot;), where he claimed Azagarium to be the hill of Zaguryna, which he found on an old Russian map &quot;Bolzoj czertez&quot; (Big drawing) near the city of Pereiaslav, now in central Ukraine.

In 2019, Ukrainian architect Boris Yerofalov-Pylypchak published a book, &quot;Roman Kyiv or Castrum Azagarium at Kyiv-Podil&quot;.

===12th to 18th century===
The archaeological excavations that were conducted in 2005–2008 found a cultural layer from the 10–12th centuries AD, which predates the first documentary mention of Chernobyl.

Around the 12th century Chernobyl was part of the land of Kievan Rus′. The first known mention of the settlement as Chernobyl is from an 1193 charter, which describes it as a hunting lodge of Knyaz Rurik Rostislavich. In 1362 it was a crown village of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Around that time the town had own castle which was ruined at least on two occasions in 1473 and 1482. The Chernobyl castle was rebuilt in the first quarter of the 16th century being located nearby the settlement in a hard to reach area. With revival of the castle, Chernobyl became a county seat. In 1552 it accounted for 196 buildings with 1,372 residents, out of which over 1,160 were considered city dwellers. In the city were developing various crafts professions such as blacksmith, cooper among others. Near Chernobyl has been excavated bog iron, out of which was produced iron. The village was granted to Filon Kmita, a captain of the royal cavalry, as a fiefdom in 1566. Following the Union of Lublin, the province where Chernobyl is located was transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1569. Under the Polish Crown, Chernobyl became a seat of eldership (starostwo). During that period Chernobyl was inhabited by Ukrainian peasants, some Polish people and a relatively large number of Jews. Jews were brought to Chernobyl by Filon Kmita, during the Polish campaign of colonization. The first mentioning of Jewish community in Chernobyl is in the 17th century. In 1600 the first Roman Catholic church was built in the town. Local population was persecuted for holding Eastern Orthodox rite services. The traditionally Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian peasantry around the town were forcibly converted, by Poland, to the Ruthenian Uniate Church. In 1626, during the Counter-Reformation, a Dominican church and monastery were founded by Lukasz Sapieha. A group of Old Catholics opposed the decrees of the Council of Trent. The Chernobyl residents actively supported the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1657).

With the signing of the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, Chernobyl was secured after the Sapieha family. Sometime in the 18th century, the place was passed on to the Chodkiewicz family. In the mid-18th century the area around Chernobyl was engulfed in a number of peasant riots, which caused Prince Riepnin to write from Warsaw to Major General Krechetnikov, requesting hussars to be sent from Kharkiv to deal with the uprising near Chernobyl in 1768. The 8th Lithuanian Infantry Regiment was stationed in the town in 1791. By the end of the 18th century, the town accounted for 2,865 residents and had 642 buildings.

===18th century to Soviet times: demography and events===
Following the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793 Chernobyl was annexed by the Russian Empire and became part of Radomyshl county (&quot;uezd&quot;) as a supernumerary town (&quot;zashtatny gorod&quot;). Many of the Uniate Church converts returned to Eastern Orthodoxy.

In 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, the Dominican monastery was sequestrated. The church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.

Until the end of the 19th century, Chernobyl was a privately owned city that belonged to the Chodkiewicz family. In 1896 they sold the city to the state, but until 1910 they owned a castle and a house in the city.

In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became a major centre of Hasidic Judaism. The Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty had been founded by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky. The Jewish population suffered greatly from pogroms in October 1905 and in March–April 1919; many Jews were killed or robbed at the instigation of the Russian nationalist Black Hundreds. When the Twersky Dynasty left Chernobyl in 1920, it ceased to exist as a center of Hasidism.

Chernobyl had a population of 10,800 in 1898, including 7,200 Jews. In the beginning of March 1918 Chernobyl was occupied in World War I by German forces in accordance with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk

===Soviet times (1920–1991)===
Ukrainians and Bolsheviks fought over the city in the ensuing Civil War. In the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–20, Chernobyl was taken first by the Polish Army and then by the cavalry of the Red Army. From 1921 onwards, it was officially incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR.

====Holodomor====
Between 1929 and 1933, Chernobyl suffered from killings during Stalin&#x27;s collectivization campaign. It was also affected by the famine that resulted from Stalin&#x27;s policies. The Polish and German community of Chernobyl was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936, during the Frontier Clearances.

====World War II and the Holocaust====
During World War II, Chernobyl was occupied by the German Army from 25 August 1941 to 17 November 1943. When the Germans arrived, only 400 Jews remained in Chernobyl; they were murdered during the Holocaust.

====Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant====
In 1972, the Duga-1 radio receiver, part of the larger Duga over-the-horizon radar array, began construction west-northwest of Chernobyl. It was the origin of the Russian Woodpecker and was designed as part of an anti-ballistic missile early-warning radar network.

On 15 August 1972, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (officially the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant) began construction about northwest of Chernobyl. The plant was built alongside Pripyat, an &quot;atomograd&quot; city founded on 4 February 1970 that was intended to serve the nuclear power plant. The decision to build the power plant was adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on recommendations of the State Planning Committee that the Ukrainian SSR be its location. It was the first nuclear power plant to be built in Ukraine.

====Nuclear disaster of 26 April 1986====
After the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant; the worst nuclear disaster in history, the city of Chernobyl was evacuated on 5 May 1986. Along with the residents of the nearby city of Pripyat, built as a home for the plant&#x27;s workers, the population was relocated to the newly built city of Slavutych. While Pripyat remains completely abandoned with no remaining inhabitants, Chernobyl has since hosted a small population.

===Independent Ukraine (1991–present)===

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of Ukraine within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone which Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union.

===Russian occupation (February–April 2022)===

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces captured the city on 24 February. Following the capture of Chernobyl, the Russian army used the city as a staging point for attacks on Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that the radiation levels in the city had started to rise due to recent military activity causing radioactive dust to ascend into the air. Hundreds of Russian soldiers were suffering from radiation poisoning after digging trenches in a contaminated area, and one died. On 31 March it was reported that Russian forces had left the exclusion zone. Ukrainian authorities reasserted control over the area on 2 April.

==Geography==
Chernobyl is located about north of Kyiv, and southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel.

===Climate===
Chernobyl has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with very warm, wet summers with cool nights and long, cold, and snowy winters.

==Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster==


On 26 April 1986, one of the reactors at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded after a scheduled test on the reactor was carried out improperly by plant operators. The resulting loss of control was due to design flaws of the RBMK reactor, which made it unstable when operated at low power, and prone to thermal runaway where increases in temperature increase reactor power output.

Chernobyl city was evacuated nine days after the disaster. The level of contamination with caesium-137 was around 555 kBq/m2 (surface ground deposition in 1986).

Later analyses concluded that, even with very conservative estimates, relocation of the city (or of any area below 1500 kBq/m2) could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health.
This however does not account for the uncertainty in the first few days of the accident about further depositions and weather patterns.
Moreover, an earlier short-term evacuation could have averted more significant doses from short-lived isotope radiation (specifically iodine-131, which has a half-life of about eight days).
The long-term health effects of the Chernobyl disaster are a subject of some controversy.

In 1998, average caesium-137 doses from the accident (estimated at 1–2 mSv per year) did not exceed those from other sources of exposure. Current effective caesium-137 dose rates as of 2019 are 200–250 nSv/h, or roughly 1.7–2.2 mSv per year,
which is comparable to the worldwide average background radiation from natural sources.

The base of operations for the administration and monitoring of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to Chernobyl. Chernobyl currently contains offices for the State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management and accommodations for visitors. Apartment blocks have been repurposed as accommodations for employees of the State Agency. The length of time that workers may spend within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is restricted by regulations that have been implemented to limit radiation exposure. Today, visits are allowed to Chernobyl but limited by strict rules.

In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched a project, called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP), for the recovery of the affected areas. The main goal of the CRDP&#x27;s activities is supporting the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to mitigate the long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.

The city has become overgrown and many types of animals live there. According to census information collected over an extended period of time, it is estimated that more mammals live there now than before the disaster.

Notably, Mikhail Gorbachev, the final leader of the Soviet Union, stated in respect to the Chernobyl disaster that, &quot;More than anything else, (Chernobyl) opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the (Soviet) system as we knew it could no longer continue.&quot;

<doc id="6102" wikidata="Q180778" url="?curid=6102" title="Cyan">
<text>Cyan () is the color between blue and green on the visible spectrum of light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength between 500 and 520 nm, between the wavelengths of green and blue.

In the subtractive color system, or CMYK color model, which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta and yellow. In the additive color system, or RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from white. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light. It is commonly seen on a bright, sunny day in the sky.

==Shades and variations ==
Different shades of cyan can vary in terms of hue, chroma (also known as saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or any combination of these characteristics. Differences in value can also be referred to as tints and shades, with a tint being a cyan mixed with white, and a shade being mixed with black.

Color nomenclature is subjective. Many shades of cyan with a bluish hue are called blue. Similarly, those with a greenish hue are referred to as green. A cyan with a dark shade is commonly known as teal. A teal blue shade leans toward the blue end of the spectrum. Variations of teal with a greener tint are commonly referred to as teal green.

Turquoise, reminiscent of the stone with the same name, is a shade in the green spectrum of cyan hues. Celeste is a lightly tinted cyan that represents the color of a clear sky. Other colors in the cyan color range are electric blue, aquamarine, and others described as blue-green.

==History ==
Cyan boasts a rich and diverse history, holding cultural significance for millennia. In ancient civilizations, turquoise, valued for its aesthetic appeal, served as a highly regarded precious gem. Turquoise comes in a variety of shades from green to blue, but cyan hues are particularly prevalent. Approximately 3,700 years ago, an intricately crafted dragon-shaped treasure made from over 2,000 pieces of turquoise and jade was created. This artifact is widely recognized as the oldest Chinese dragon totem by many Chinese scholars.

Turquoise jewelry also held significant importance among the Aztecs, who often featured this precious gemstone in vibrant frescoes for both symbolic and decorative purposes. The Aztecs revered turquoise, associating its color with the heavens and sacredness. Additionally, ancient Egyptians interpreted cyan hues as representing faith and truth, while Tibetans viewed them as a symbol of infinity.

After earlier uses in various contexts, cyan hues found increased use in diverse cultures due to their appealing aesthetic qualities in religious structures and art pieces. For example, the prominent dome of the Goharshad Mosque in Iran, built in 1418, showcases this trend. Additionally, Jacopo da Pontormo&#x27;s use of a teal shade for Mary&#x27;s robe in the 1528 painting &quot;Carmignano Visitation&quot; demonstrates the allure for these hues. During the 16th century, speakers of the English language began using the term &quot;turquoise&quot; to describe the cyan color of objects that resembled the color of the stone.

In the 1870s, the French sculptor Frédéric Bartholdi began the construction of what would later become the Statue of Liberty. Over time, exposure to the elements caused the copper structure to develop its distinctive patina, now recognized as iconic cyan. Following this, there was a significant advancement in the use of cyan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Impressionist artists, such as Claude Monet in his renowned &quot;Water Lilies&quot;, effectively incorporated cyan hues into their works. Deviating from traditional interpretations of local color under neutral lighting conditions, the focus of artists was on accurately depicting perceived color and the influence of light on altering object hues. Specifically, daylight plays a significant role in shifting the perceived color of objects toward cyan hues. In 1917, the color term &quot;teal&quot; was introduced to describe deeper shades of cyan.

In the late 19th century, while &quot;traditional&quot; nomenclature of red, yellow, and blue persisted, the printing industry initiated a shift towards utilizing magenta and cyan inks for red and blue hues, respectively. This transition aimed to establish a more versatile color gamut achievable with only three primary colors. In 1949, a document in the printing industry stated: “The four-color set comprises Yellow, Red (magenta), Blue (cyan), Black”. This practice of labeling magenta, yellow, and cyan as red, yellow, and blue persisted until 1961. As the hues evolved, the printing industry maintained the use of the &quot;traditional&quot; terms red, yellow, and blue. Consequently, pinpointing the exact date of origin for CMYK, in which cyan serves as a primary color, proves &quot;challenging&quot;.

In August 1991, the HP Deskwriter 500C became the first Deskwriter to offer color printing as an option. It used interchangeable black and color (cyan, magenta, and yellow) inkjet print cartridges. With the inclusion of cyan ink in printers, the term &quot;cyan&quot; has become widely recognized in both home and office settings. According to TUP/Technology User Profile 2020, approximately 70% of online American adults regularly use a home printer.

==Etymology and terminology==
Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;kyanos&quot; (κύανος), meaning &quot;dark blue enamel, Lapis lazuli&quot;. It was formerly known as &quot;cyan blue&quot; or cyan-blue, and its first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1879. Further origins of the color name can be traced back to a dye produced from the cornflower (&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;).

In most languages, &#x27;cyan&#x27; is not a basic color term and it appears as a greenish vibrant hue of blue to most English speakers. Other English terms for this &quot;borderline&quot; hue region include &quot;blue green&quot;, &quot;aqua&quot;, &quot;turquoise&quot;, &quot;teal&quot;, and &quot;grue&quot;.

==On the web and in printing==

===Web colors cyan and aqua===
The web color cyan shown at right is a secondary color in the RGB color model, which uses combinations of red, green and blue light to create all the colors on computer and television displays. In X11 colors, this color is called both cyan and aqua. In the HTML color list, this same color is called aqua.

The web colors are more vivid than the cyan used in the CMYK color system, and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer&#x27;s cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called &quot;aqua&quot; (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with water, such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.

===Process cyan===
Cyan is also one of the common inks used in four-color printing, along with magenta, yellow, and black; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK. In printing, the cyan ink is sometimes known as printer&#x27;s cyan, process cyan, or process blue.

While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called &quot;cyan&quot;, they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink is typically more saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what RGB color space and ink are considered. That is, process cyan is usually outside the RGB gamut, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer&#x27;s ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. This is because real-world subtractive (unlike additive) color mixing does not consistently produce the same result when mixing apparently identical colors, since the specific frequencies filtered out to produce that color affect how it interacts with other colors. Phthalocyanine blue is one such commonly used pigment. A typical formulation of &quot;process cyan&quot; is shown in the color box on the right.

==In science and nature==

===Color of water===
* Pure water is nearly colorless. However, it does absorb slightly more red light than blue, giving significant volumes of water a bluish tint; increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green, for a typically cyan net color.

===Cyan and cyanide===
* Cyanide derives its name from Prussian blue, a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion.

===Bacteria===
* Cyanobacteria (sometimes called blue-green algae) are an important link in the food chain.

===Astronomy===
* The planet Uranus is colored cyan because of the abundance of methane in its atmosphere. Methane absorbs red light and reflects the blue-green light which allows observers to see it as cyan.

===Energy===
* Natural gas (methane), used by many for home cooking on gas stoves, has a cyan colored flame when burned with a mixture of air.

===Photography and film===
* Cyanotype, or blueprint, a monochrome photographic printing process that predates the use of the word &quot;cyan&quot; as a color, yields a deep &quot;cyan-blue&quot; colored print based on the Prussian blue pigment.
* Cinecolor, a bi-pack color process, the photographer would load a standard camera with two films, one orthochromatic, dyed red, and a panchromatic strip behind it. Color light would expose the cyan record on the ortho stock, which also acted as a filter, exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock.

===Medicine===
* Cyanosis is an abnormal blueness of the skin, usually a sign of poor oxygen intake; patients are typically described as being &quot;cyanotic&quot;.
* Cyanopsia is a color vision defect where vision is tinted blue. This can be a drug-induced side effect or experienced after cataract removal.

<text>Conventional insulin therapy is a therapeutic regimen for treatment of diabetes mellitus which contrasts with the newer intensive insulin therapy.

This older method (prior to the development home blood glucose monitoring) is still in use in a proportion of cases.

== Characteristics ==
Conventional insulin therapy is characterized by:
* Insulin injections of a mixture of regular (or rapid) and intermediate acting insulin are performed two times a day, or to improve overnight glucose, mixed in the morning to cover breakfast and lunch, but with regular (or rapid) acting insulin alone for dinner and intermediate acting insulin at bedtime (instead of being mixed in at dinner).
* Meals are scheduled to match the anticipated peaks in the insulin profiles.
* The target range for blood glucose levels is higher than is desired in the intensive regimen.
* Frequent measurements of blood glucose levels were not used.

== Effects ==
The down side of this method is that it is difficult to achieve as good results of glycemic control as with intensive insulin therapy. The advantage is that, for diabetics with a regular lifestyle, the regime is less intrusive than the intensive therapy.

<doc id="6109" wikidata="Q13228" url="?curid=6109" title="Cream">
<text>Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called &quot;separators&quot;. In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.

Cream skimmed from milk may be called &quot;sweet cream&quot; to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy, and &quot;cheesy&quot;. In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes.

Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. Carotenoids are also the origin of butter&#x27;s yellow color. Cream from goat&#x27;s milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

==Cuisine==

Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice cream, many sauces, soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes. Whipped cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, lassi, eggnog, sweet pies, strawberries, blueberries, or peaches. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes. Both single and double cream (see Types for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat crème fraîche is often used when the cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent it separating or &quot;splitting&quot;. Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.

Cream (usually light/single cream or half and half) may be added to coffee.

The French word denotes not only dairy cream but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk, not cream.

==Types ==

Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Standard 2.5.2 – Defines cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream sold without further specification must contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.

Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows:

=== Canada ===

Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for &quot;light cream&quot;, which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6 percent butterfat. Specific product characteristics are generally uniform throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by manufacturer: &quot;coffee cream&quot; may be 10 or 18 percent cream and &quot;half-and-half&quot; () may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and brand.

Regulations allow cream to contain acidity regulators and stabilizers. For whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (≤ 0.25%), glucose solids (≤ 0.1%), calcium sulphate (≤ 0.005%), and xanthan gum (≤ 0.02%). The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage followed by &quot;milk fat&quot;, &quot;B.F&quot;, or &quot;M.F&quot;.

=== France ===
In France, the use of the term &quot;cream&quot; for food products is defined by the decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980. It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat (12%) as well as the rules for pasteurisation or UHT sterilisation. The mention &quot;crème fraîche&quot; (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none will be found in plain &quot;crèmes&quot; and &quot;crèmes fraîches&quot; apart from lactic ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening agents, but rarely). Fat content is commonly shown as &quot;XX% M.G.&quot; (&quot;matière grasse&quot;).
=== Russia ===
Russia, as well as other EAC countries, legally separates cream into two classes: normal (10–34% butterfat) and heavy (35–58%), but the industry has pretty much standardized around the following types:
===Sweden===
In Sweden, cream is usually sold as:
*Matlagningsgrädde (&quot;&quot;cooking cream&quot;), 10–15%
*Kaffegrädde (&quot;Coffee cream&quot;&quot;), 10–12%, earlier mostly 12%
*Vispgrädde (&quot;whipping cream&quot;), 36–40%, the 36% variant often has additives.

Mellangrädde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. 
Gräddfil (usually 12%) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35%) are two common sour cream products.

=== Switzerland ===

In Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined as follows:

Sour cream and crème fraîche (German: Sauerrahm, Crème fraîche; French: crème acidulée, crème fraîche; Italian: panna acidula, crème fraîche) are defined as cream soured by bacterial cultures.

Thick cream (German: ; French: ; Italian: ) is defined as cream thickened using thickening agents.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, these types of cream are produced. Fat content must meet the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.

===United States===
In the United States, cream is usually sold as:

Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures, except for &quot;manufacturer&#x27;s cream&quot;, are based on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 131.

==Processing and additives==
Cream may have thickening agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include sodium alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium bicarbonate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and alginic acid.

Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called &quot;feathering&quot;) when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.

==Other cream products==

 by churning cream to separate the butterfat and buttermilk. This can be done by hand or by machine.

Whipped cream is made by whisking or mixing air into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. Nitrous oxide, from whipped-cream chargers may also be used to make whipped cream.

Sour cream, produced in many countries, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a bacterial culture that produces lactic acid (0.5%+), which sours and thickens it.

Crème fraîche (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican crema (or cream espesa) is similar to crème fraîche.

Smetana is a heavy cream-derived (15–40% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.

Rjome or rømme is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to Icelandic sýrður rjómi.

Clotted cream in the United Kingdom is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product, similar to Indian malai.

Reduced cream is a cream product in New Zealand, often used to make Kiwi dip.

==Other items called &quot;cream&quot;==
Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish; hand/body &quot;creme&quot; or &quot;skin cream&quot; is meant for moisturizing the skin.

Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word &quot;cream&quot; for foods. Words such as &quot;creme&quot;, &quot;kreme&quot;, &quot;creame&quot;, or &quot;whipped topping&quot; (e.g., Cool Whip) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of &quot;idem sonans&quot;. Oreo and Hydrox cookies are a type of sandwich cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them that is called &quot;crème filling.&quot; In some cases, foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example, in Britain, &quot;ice cream&quot; can contain non-milk fat (declared on the label) in addition to or instead of cream, and salad cream is the customary name for a non-dairy condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.

In other languages, cognates of &quot;cream&quot; are also sometimes used for non-food products, such as (Hungarian for toothpaste), or (German for sunscreen).

Some products are described as &quot;cream alternatives&quot;. For example, &quot;Elmlea Double&quot;, etc. are blends of buttermilk or lentils and vegetable oil with other additives sold by Upfield in the United Kingdom packaged and shelved in the same way as cream, labelled as having &quot;a creamy taste&quot;.

<doc id="6111" wikidata="Q505668" url="?curid=6111" title="Chemical vapor deposition">
<text>Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a vacuum deposition method used to produce high-quality, and high-performance, solid materials. The process is often used in the semiconductor industry to produce thin films.

In typical CVD, the wafer (substrate) is exposed to one or more volatile , which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

Microfabrication processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial. These materials include: silicon (dioxide, carbide, nitride, oxynitride), carbon (fiber, nanofibers, nanotubes, diamond and graphene), fluorocarbons, filaments, tungsten, titanium nitride and various high-κ dielectrics.

The term &quot;chemical vapour deposition&quot; was coined in 1960 by &quot;John M. Blocher, Jr.&quot; who intended to differentiate &quot;chemical&quot; from &quot;physical vapour deposition&quot; (PVD).

== Types ==

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures. Many journal articles and commercial tools use the term reduced pressure CVD (RPCVD) especially for single wafer tools in place of LPCVD which dominates for multi-wafer furnace tube tools. Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** Ultrahigh vacuum CVD (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10−6 Pa (≈ 10−8 torr). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and ultra-high vacuum is common, often 10−7 Pa.
** Sub-atmospheric CVD (SACVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures. Uses tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and ozone to fill high aspect ratio Si structures with silicon dioxide (SiO2).

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** Aerosol assisted CVD (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** Direct liquid injection CVD (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also Plasma processing):
** Microwave plasma-assisted CVD (MPCVD)
** Plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes plasma to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors. PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.
** Remote plasma-enhanced CVD (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
** Low-energy plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (LEPECVD) - CVD employing a high density, low energy plasma to obtain epitaxial deposition of semiconductor materials at high rates and low temperatures.
* Atomic-layer CVD (ALCVD) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, crystalline films. See Atomic layer epitaxy.
* Combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
* Hot filament CVD (HFCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or more commonly, initiated CVD, this process uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases. The filament temperature and substrate temperature thus are independently controlled, allowing colder temperatures for better absorption rates at the substrate and higher temperatures necessary for decomposition of precursors to free radicals at the filament.
* Hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) – This process involves both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and vaporization of a solid source.
* Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) – This CVD process is based on metalorganic precursors.
* Rapid thermal CVD (RTCVD) – This CVD process uses heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions that can lead to particle formation.
* Vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE)
* Photo-initiated CVD (PICVD) – This process uses UV light to stimulate chemical reactions. It is similar to plasma processing, given that plasmas are strong emitters of UV radiation. Under certain conditions, PICVD can be operated at or near atmospheric pressure.
* Laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) - This CVD process uses lasers to heat spots or lines on a substrate in semiconductor applications. In MEMS and in fiber production the lasers are used rapidly to break down the precursor gas—process temperature can exceed 2000 °C—to build up a solid structure in much the same way as laser sintering based 3-D printers build up solids from powders.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of atomic layer deposition at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist. Gallium arsenide is used in some integrated circuits (ICs) and photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices. Certain carbides and nitrides confer wear-resistance. Polymerization by CVD, perhaps the most versatile of all applications, allows for super-thin coatings which possess some very desirable qualities, such as lubricity, hydrophobicity and weather-resistance to name a few. The CVD of metal-organic frameworks, a class of crystalline nanoporous materials, has recently been demonstrated. Recently scaled up as an integrated cleanroom process depositing large-area substrates, the applications for these films are anticipated in gas sensing and low-κ dielectrics. CVD techniques are advantageous for membrane coatings as well, such as those in desalination or water treatment, as these coatings can be sufficiently uniform (conformal) and thin that they do not clog membrane pores.

==Commercially important materials prepared by CVD==

===Polysilicon===

Polycrystalline silicon is deposited from trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) or silane (SiH4), using the following reactions:
:SiHCl3 → Si + Cl2 + HCl
:SiH4 → Si + 2 H2

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% nitrogen. Temperatures between 600 and 650 °C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 nm per minute. An alternative process uses a hydrogen-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050 °C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as phosphine, arsine or diborane are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply &quot;oxide&quot; in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include silane and oxygen, dichlorosilane (SiCl2H2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Si(OC2H5)4). The reactions are as follows:

:SiH4 + O2 → SiO2 + 2 H2

:SiCl2H2 + 2 N2O → SiO2 + 2 N2 + 2 HCl

:Si(OC2H5)4 → SiO2 + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, aluminium is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500 °C, dichlorosilane at around 900 °C, and TEOS between 650 and 750 °C, resulting in a layer of &quot;low- temperature oxide&quot; (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower dielectric strength, for instance), and it deposits nonconformally. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than thermal oxide, but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities (alloying or &quot;doping&quot;). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may diffuse from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with phosphorus pentoxide (&quot;P-glass&quot;) can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000 °C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH3 + 5 O2 → 2 P2O5 + 6 H2

Glasses containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850 °C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO4 can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces chlorine.

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500 °C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH4 + 4 NH3 → Si3N4 + 12 H2

:3 SiCl2H2 + 4 NH3 → Si3N4 + 6 HCl + 6 H2

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile stress, which may crack films thicker than 200 nm. However, it has higher resistivity and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (1016 Ω·cm and 10 MV/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH4 + N2 → 2 SiNH + 3 H2

:SiH4 + NH3 → SiNH + 3 H2

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 106 to 1015 Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).

=== Metals ===
Tungsten CVD, used for forming conductive contacts, vias, and plugs on a semiconductor device, is achieved from tungsten hexafluoride (WF6), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF6 → W + 3 F2
:WF6 + 3 H2 → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and copper, can be deposited by CVD. , commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu(hfac)2. Copper is typically deposited by electroplating. Aluminium can be deposited from triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL) and related organoaluminium compounds.

CVD for molybdenum, tantalum, titanium, nickel is widely used. These metals can form useful silicides when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal &quot;M&quot;, the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl5 + 5 H2 → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)n → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

Niobium(V) oxide layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide with the loss of diethyl ether according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC2H5)5 → Nb2O5 + 5 C2H5OC2H5

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source

The most popular carbon source that is used to produce graphene is methane gas. One of the less popular choices is petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.

Although methane is the most popular carbon source, hydrogen is required during the preparation process to promote carbon deposition on the substrate. If the flow ratio of methane and hydrogen are not appropriate, it will cause undesirable results. During the growth of graphene, the role of methane is to provide a carbon source, the role of hydrogen is to provide H atoms to corrode amorphous C, and improve the quality of graphene. But excessive H atoms can also corrode graphene. As a result, the integrity of the crystal lattice is destroyed, and the quality of graphene is deteriorated. Therefore, by optimizing the flow rate of methane and hydrogen gases in the growth process, the quality of graphene can be improved.
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup, or situated at some distance away at the deposition area. Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.
* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa. However, some still use APCVD. Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800 to 1050 °C. High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system. These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene. Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene&#x27;s exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===

CVD can be used to produce a synthetic diamond by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 kPa; 0.145–3.926 psi; 7.5–203 Torr) and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include hot filament, microwave power, and arc discharges, among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free-standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond, growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) in diameter have been achieved, and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond&#x27;s important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat-producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink. Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond&#x27;s hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate. Diamond&#x27;s very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Pyrex glass, a coefficient of friction close to that of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) and strong lipophilicity would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word &quot;diamond&quot; is used as a description of any material primarily made up of sp3-bonded carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single-crystal diamond can be made containing various dopants. Polycrystalline diamond consisting of grain sizes from several nanometers to several micrometers can be grown. Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond&#x27;s hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

<text>The CN Tower () is a communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name &quot;CN&quot; referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway&#x27;s decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company&#x27;s privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government&#x27;s real estate portfolio.

The CN Tower held the record for the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world&#x27;s tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.

It is a signature icon of Toronto&#x27;s skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some , and an entertainment complex.

== History ==
The original concept of the CN Tower was first conceived in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large television and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, and to demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.

The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant after the opening of the MacMillan Yard north of the city in 1965 (then known as Toronto Yard). Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).

As Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably First Canadian Place, which has Bank of Montreal&#x27;s head offices. The reflective nature of the new buildings reduced the quality of broadcast signals, requiring new, higher antennas that were at least tall. The radio wire is estimated to be long in 44 pieces, the heaviest of which weighs around .

At the time, most data communications took place over point-to-point microwave links, whose dish antennas covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent &quot;hub&quot; space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.

The original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical &quot;pillars&quot; linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.

The idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (later renamed SkyPod) was not part of the plans until later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. Also around this time, it was realized that the tower could become the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure to improve signal quality and attract tourists, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.

=== Construction ===
The CN Tower was built by Canada Cement Company (also known as the Cement Foundation Company of Canada at the time), a subsidiary of Sweden&#x27;s Skanska, a global project-development and construction group.

Construction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, of earth and shale were removed to a depth of in the centre, and a base incorporating of concrete with of rebar and of steel cable had been built to a thickness of . This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.

To create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised slipform at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built tall Inco Superstack in Sudbury, built using similar methods.

The tower contains of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form&#x27;s location to massive plumb bobs hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only .

In August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.

While still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.

The antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but, during construction, the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter became available when the United States Army sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named &quot;Olga&quot;, was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.

The flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow&#x27;s Ostankino Tower, and bringing the total mass to .

Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that &quot;All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,&quot; and that &quot;Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.&quot;

==== Phases of construction ====
=== Opening ===
The CN Tower opened on June 26, 1976. The construction costs of approximately ($ in dollars) were repaid in fifteen years.

From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed Rogers Centre in 2005), the former Railway Lands were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the SkyWalk in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby Union Station railway and subway station, and, in turn, to the city&#x27;s Path underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a boom in condominium construction in the first quarter of the 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium by the base of the tower.

===Early years ===
When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at , the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at , and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at . One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.

The tower would garner worldwide media attention when stuntman Dar Robinson jumped off the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980. The first was for a scene from the movie &quot;Highpoint&quot;, in which Robinson received ($ in dollars) for the stunt. The second was for a personal documentary. The first stunt had him use a parachute which he deployed three seconds before impact with the ground, while the second one used a wire decelerator attached to his back.

On June 26, 1986, the tenth anniversary of the tower&#x27;s opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground.

From 1985 to 1992, the CN Tower basement level hosted the world&#x27;s first flight simulator ride, Tour of the Universe, based on the flight of a Space Shuttle. The ride was replaced in 1992 with a similar attraction entitled &quot;Space Race.&quot; It was later dismantled and replaced by two other rides in 1998 and 1999.

=== The 1990s and 2000s ===
A glass floor at an elevation of was installed in 1994. Canadian National Railway sold the tower to Canada Lands Company prior to privatizing the company in 1995, when it divested all operations not directly related to its core freight shipping businesses. The tower&#x27;s name and wordmark were adjusted to remove the CN railways logo, and the tower&#x27;s official name was renamed Canada&#x27;s National Tower (from Canadian National Tower), though the tower is commonly called the CN Tower.

Further changes were made from 1997 to January 2004: TrizecHahn Corporation managed the tower and instituted several expansion projects including a entertainment expansion, the 1997 addition of two new elevators (to a total of six) and the consequential relocation of the staircase from the north side leg to inside the core of the building, a conversion that also added nine stairs to the climb. TrizecHahn also owned the Willis Tower (Sears Tower at the time) in Chicago approximately at the same time.

In 2007, light-emitting diode (LED) lights replaced the incandescent lights that lit the CN Tower at night. This was done to take advantage of the cost savings of LED lights over incandescent lights. The colour of the LED lights can change, compared to the constant white colour of the incandescent lights. On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, then under construction and known as Burj Dubai, surpassed the CN Tower as the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure on land. In 2008, glass panels were installed in one of the CN Tower elevators, which established a world record () for highest glass floor panelled elevator in the world.

=== 2010s: EdgeWalk ===
On August 1, 2011, the CN Tower opened the EdgeWalk, an amusement in which thrill-seekers can walk on and around the roof of the main pod of the tower at , which is directly above the 360 Restaurant. It is the world&#x27;s highest full-circle, hands-free walk. Visitors are tethered to an overhead rail system and walk around the edge of the CN Tower&#x27;s main pod above the 360 Restaurant on a metal floor. The attraction is closed throughout the winter and during periods of electrical storms and high winds.

One of the notable guests who visited EdgeWalk was Canadian comedian Rick Mercer, featured as the first episode of the ninth season of his CBC Television news satire show, &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;. There, he was accompanied by Canadian pop singer Jann Arden. The episode first aired on April 10, 2013.

==== 2015 Pan Am Games ====
The tower and surrounding areas were prominent in the 2015 Pan American Games production. In the opening ceremony, a pre-recorded segment featured track-and-field athlete Bruny Surin passing the flame to sprinter Donovan Bailey on the EdgeWalk and parachuting into Rogers Centre. A fireworks display off the tower concluded both the opening and closing ceremonies.

==== Canada 150 ====
On July 1, 2017, as part of the nationwide celebrations for Canada 150, which celebrated the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, fireworks were once again shot from the tower in a five-minute display coordinated with the tower lights and music broadcast on a local radio station.

== Closures ==
*The CN Tower was closed on September 11, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.
*The CN Tower was closed during the G20 summit on June 26–27, 2010, for security reasons, given its proximity to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and ongoing citywide protests and riots.
*The CN Tower was closed from 2020 to 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions throughout Ontario.
*The CN Tower was closed on December 16, 2021, due to glass falling off from heavy winds.

== Structure ==

The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The tower&#x27;s six elevators are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower&#x27;s hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower&#x27;s new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace, which are both located at an elevation of , the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as &quot;Indoor Observation Level&quot;) located at , and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as &quot;Space Deck&quot;) at , just below the metal antenna. The hexagonal shape is visible between the two highest areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod.

The main deck level has seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas—at —is a large white donut-shaped radome containing the structure&#x27;s UHF transmitters. The glass floor and outdoor observation deck are at . The glass floor has an area of and can withstand a pressure of . The floor&#x27;s thermal glass units are thick, consisting of a pane of laminated glass, airspace and a pane of laminated glass. In 2008, one elevator was upgraded to add a glass floor panel, believed to have the highest vertical rise of any elevator equipped with this feature. The Horizons Cafe and the lookout level are at . The 360 Restaurant, a revolving restaurant that completes a full rotation once every 72 minutes, is at . When the tower first opened, it also featured a discotheque named Sparkles (at the Indoor Observation Level), billed as the highest disco and dance floor in the world.

The SkyPod was once the highest public observation deck in the world until it was surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center in 2008.

A metal staircase reaches the main deck level after 1,776 steps, and the SkyPod above after 2,579 steps; it is the tallest metal staircase on Earth. These stairs are intended for emergency use only except for charity stair-climb events two times during the year. The average climber takes approximately 30 minutes to climb to the base of the radome, but the fastest climb on record is 7 minutes and 52 seconds in 1989 by Brendan Keenoy, an Ontario Provincial Police officer. In 2002, Canadian Olympian and Paralympic champion Jeff Adams climbed the stairs of the tower in a specially designed wheelchair. The stairs were originally on one of the three sides of the tower (facing north), with a glass view, but these were later replaced with the third elevator pair and the stairs were moved to the inside of the core. Top climbs on the new, windowless stairwell used since around 2003 have generally been over ten minutes.

=== Falling ice danger ===
A freezing rain storm on March 2, 2007, resulted in a layer of ice several centimetres thick forming on the side of the tower and other downtown buildings. The sun thawed the ice, then winds of up to blew some of it away from the structure. There were fears that cars and windows of nearby buildings would be smashed by large chunks of ice. In response, police closed some streets surrounding the tower. During morning rush hour on March 5 of the same year, police expanded the area of closed streets to include the Gardiner Expressway away from the tower as increased winds blew the ice farther, as far north as King Street West, away, where a taxicab window was shattered. Subsequently, on March 6, 2007, the Gardiner Expressway reopened after winds abated.

On April 16, 2018, falling ice from the CN Tower punctured the roof of the nearby Rogers Centre stadium, causing the Toronto Blue Jays to postpone the game that day to the following day as a doubleheader; this was the third doubleheader held at the Rogers Centre. On April 20 of the same year, the CN Tower reopened.

=== Safety features ===
In August 2000, a fire broke out at the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, killing three people and causing extensive damage. The fire was blamed on poor maintenance and outdated equipment. The failure of the fire-suppression systems and the lack of proper equipment for firefighters allowed the fire to destroy most of the interior and sparked fears the tower might even collapse.

The Ostankino Tower was completed nine years before the CN Tower and is only shorter. The parallels between the towers led to some concern that the CN Tower could be at risk of a similar tragedy. However, Canadian officials subsequently stated that it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that a similar disaster could occur at the CN Tower, as it has important safeguards that were not present in the Ostankino Tower. Specifically, officials cited:

* the fireproof building materials used in the tower&#x27;s construction,
* frequent and stringent safety inspections,
* an extensive sprinkler system,
* a 24-hour emergency monitoring operation,
* two 68,160-litre (15,000-imperial gallon; 18,006-US gallon) water reservoirs at the top, which are automatically replenished,
* a fire hose at the base of the structure capable of sending to any location in the tower,
* a ban on natural gas appliances anywhere in the tower (including the restaurant in the main pod),
* an elevator that can be used during a fire as it runs up the outside of the building and can be powered by three emergency generators at the base of the structure (unlike the elevator at the Ostankino Tower, which malfunctioned).

Officials also noted that the CN Tower has an excellent safety record, although there was an electrical fire in the antennas on August 16, 2017 — the tower&#x27;s first fire. Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967 and 1976 — such as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the World Trade Center (until its destruction on September 11, 2001), the Fernsehturm Berlin, the Aon Center, 875 North Michigan Avenue (formerly the John Hancock Center), and First Canadian Place — also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the Ostankino Tower accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.

== Lighting ==

The CN Tower was originally lit at night with incandescent lights, which were removed in 1997 because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright LED lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower&#x27;s mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28, 2007, before the Canada Day holiday weekend.

The tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower was lit in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader and leader of the official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower was lit in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower was lit in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the tower displayed the colours of the French flag. On June 8, 2021, the tower displayed the colours of the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; archrivals Montreal Canadiens after they advanced to the semifinals of 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. The CN Tower was lit in the colours of the Ukrainian flag during the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022.

Programmed remotely from a desktop computer with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.

During the spring and autumn bird migration seasons, the lights are turned off to comply with the voluntary Fatal Light Awareness Program, which &quot;encourages buildings to dim unnecessary exterior lighting to mitigate bird mortality during spring and summer migration.&quot;

== Height comparisons ==

The CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there were two other freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere exceeding in height: the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at when measured to its pinnacle, and One World Trade Center in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of , or approximately shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed Chicago Spire was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.

=== Height distinction debate ===

==== &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Tower&quot; title ====
&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; has called the CN Tower &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest self-supporting tower&quot; and &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing tower&quot;. Although Guinness did list this description of the CN Tower under the heading &quot;tallest building&quot; at least once, it has also listed it under &quot;tallest tower&quot;, omitting it from its list of &quot;tallest buildings.&quot; In 1996, Guinness changed the tower&#x27;s classification to &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure&quot;. Emporis and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat both listed the CN Tower as the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure on land, and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of world&#x27;s tallest building to Taipei 101, which is shorter than the CN Tower. The issue of what was tallest became moot when Burj Khalifa, then under construction, exceeded the height of the CN Tower in 2007 (see below).

Although the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift shop and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors continuously from the ground, and therefore it is not considered a building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a building as &quot;a structure that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it has floors.&quot; The CN Tower and other similar structures—such as the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia; the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, China; The Strat in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States; and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France—are categorized as &quot;towers&quot;, which are free-standing structures that may have observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower was the tallest tower by this definition until 2010 (see below).

Taller than the CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, in the United States at tall, leading to a distinction between these and &quot;free-standing&quot; structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform stands above its base on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi River Delta, but only the top of this oil and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings.

On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening), passed the CN Tower&#x27;s 553.33-m height. The CN Tower held the record of the tallest freestanding structure on land for over 30 years.

After Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s tallest freestanding structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world&#x27;s tallest freestanding tower. The tower definition used by Guinness was defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as &#x27;a building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable floor space&#x27;. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced that Burj Khalifa was not classified as a tower because it has too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower. CN Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351 m, highest above-ground restaurant at 346 m (Horizons Restaurant), and tallest free-standing concrete tower during Guinness&#x27;s recertification. The CN Tower was surpassed in 2009 by the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China, which stands at tall, as the world&#x27;s tallest tower; which in turn was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree in 2011, which currently is the tallest tower at in height. The CN Tower, as of 2022, stands as the tenth-tallest free-standing structure on land, remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is the third-tallest tower. The CN Tower is the second-tallest free-standing structure in the Commonwealth of Nations behind Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

==== Height records ====
Since its construction, the tower has gained the following world height records:
== Use ==

The CN Tower has been and continues to be used as a communications tower for a number of different media and by numerous companies.

=== Television broadcasters ===
=== Radio ===
There is no AM broadcasting from the CN Tower. The FM transmitters are situated in a metal broadcast antenna, on top of the main concrete portion of the tower at an elevation above from the ground.

=== Communications ===
* Bell Canada
* Toronto Transit Commission
* Amateur radio repeaters &quot;2-Tango&quot; (VHF) and &quot;4-Tango&quot; (440/70 cm UHF)—owned and operated by the Toronto FM Communications Society, under callsign VE3TWR

== In popular culture ==
The CN Tower has been featured in numerous films, television shows, music recording covers, and video games. The tower also has its own official mascot, which resembles the tower itself.

*&quot;Highpoint&quot; is a Canadian 1982 action film starring Richard Harris, Christopher Plummer and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo. It features a shot of stuntman Dar Robinson jumping off of the CN Tower in 1979.
*&quot;Views&quot; is a 2016 studio album released on April 29, 2016, by Canadian rapper Drake. The cover artwork features Drake sitting atop the CN Tower in Toronto. Drake appeared significantly larger than life-size on the cover, and the CN Tower&#x27;s Twitter account later confirmed it to be photo edited.

<text>In calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the composition of two differentiable functions and in terms of the derivatives of and . More precisely, if formula_1 is the function such that formula_2 for every , then the chain rule is, in Lagrange&#x27;s notation,
formula_3
or, equivalently,
formula_4

The chain rule may also be expressed in Leibniz&#x27;s notation. If a variable depends on the variable , which itself depends on the variable (that is, and are dependent variables), then depends on as well, via the intermediate variable . In this case, the chain rule is expressed as
formula_5 
and
formula_6
for indicating at which points the derivatives have to be evaluated.

In integration, the counterpart to the chain rule is the substitution rule.

==Intuitive explanation==
Intuitively, the chain rule states that knowing the instantaneous rate of change of relative to and that of relative to allows one to calculate the instantaneous rate of change of relative to as the product of the two rates of change.

As put by George F. Simmons: &quot;If a car travels twice as fast as a bicycle and the bicycle is four times as fast as a walking man, then the car travels 2 × 4 = 8 times as fast as the man.&quot;

The relationship between this example and the chain rule is as follows. Let , and be the (variable) positions of the car, the bicycle, and the walking man, respectively. The rate of change of relative positions of the car and the bicycle is formula_7 Similarly, formula_8 So, the rate of change of the relative positions of the car and the walking man is
formula_9

The rate of change of positions is the ratio of the speeds, and the speed is the derivative of the position with respect to the time; that is,
formula_10
or, equivalently,
formula_11
which is also an application of the chain rule.

== History ==

The chain rule seems to have first been used by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He used it to calculate the derivative of formula_12 as the composite of the square root function and the function formula_13. He first mentioned it in a 1676 memoir (with a sign error in the calculation). The common notation of the chain rule is due to Leibniz. Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital used the chain rule implicitly in his &quot;Analyse des infiniment petits&quot;. The chain rule does not appear in any of Leonhard Euler&#x27;s analysis books, even though they were written over a hundred years after Leibniz&#x27;s discovery.. It is believed that the first &quot;modern&quot; version of the chain rule appears in Lagrange&#x27;s 1797 &quot;Théorie des fonctions analytiques&quot;; it also appears in Cauchy&#x27;s 1823 &quot;Résumé des Leçons données a L’École Royale Polytechnique sur Le Calcul Infinitesimal&quot;.

== Statement ==

The simplest form of the chain rule is for real-valued functions of one real variable. It states that if &#x27; is a function that is differentiable at a point &#x27; (i.e. the derivative exists) and &#x27; is a function that is differentiable at , then the composite function formula_14 is differentiable at &#x27;, and the derivative is
formula_15
The rule is sometimes abbreviated as
formula_16

If and , then this abbreviated form is written in Leibniz notation as:
formula_17

The points where the derivatives are evaluated may also be stated explicitly:
formula_18

Carrying the same reasoning further, given &quot;&quot; functions formula_19 with the composite function formula_20, if each function formula_21 is differentiable at its immediate input, then the composite function is also differentiable by the repeated application of Chain Rule, where the derivative is (in Leibniz&#x27;s notation):
formula_22

== Applications ==
=== Composites of more than two functions ===
The chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions. To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of , , and &#x27; (in that order) is the composite of with . The chain rule states that to compute the derivative of , it is sufficient to compute the derivative of &#x27; and the derivative of . The derivative of can be calculated directly, and the derivative of can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.

For concreteness, consider the function
formula_23
This can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:
formula_24
So that formula_25.

Their derivatives are:
formula_26

The chain rule states that the derivative of their composite at the point is:
formula_27

In Leibniz&#x27;s notation, this is:
formula_28
or for short,
formula_29
The derivative function is therefore:
formula_30

Another way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function as the composite of and &quot;h&quot;. Applying the chain rule in this manner would yield:
formula_31

This is the same as what was computed above. This should be expected because .

Sometimes, it is necessary to differentiate an arbitrarily long composition of the form formula_32. In this case, define
formula_33
where formula_34 and formula_35 when formula_36. Then the chain rule takes the form
formula_37
or, in the Lagrange notation,
formula_38

=== Quotient rule ===

The chain rule can be used to derive some well-known differentiation rules. For example, the quotient rule is a consequence of the chain rule and the product rule. To see this, write the function as the product . First apply the product rule:
formula_39

To compute the derivative of , notice that it is the composite of with the reciprocal function, that is, the function that sends to . The derivative of the reciprocal function is formula_40. By applying the chain rule, the last expression becomes:
formula_41
which is the usual formula for the quotient rule.

=== Derivatives of inverse functions ===

Suppose that has an inverse function. Call its inverse function so that we have . There is a formula for the derivative of in terms of the derivative of . To see this, note that and satisfy the formula
formula_42

And because the functions formula_43 and are equal, their derivatives must be equal. The derivative of is the constant function with value 1, and the derivative of formula_43 is determined by the chain rule. Therefore, we have that:
formula_45

To express as a function of an independent variable , we substitute formula_46 for wherever it appears. Then we can solve for .
formula_47

For example, consider the function . It has an inverse . Because , the above formula says that
formula_48

This formula is true whenever is differentiable and its inverse is also differentiable. This formula can fail when one of these conditions is not true. For example, consider . Its inverse is , which is not differentiable at zero. If we attempt to use the above formula to compute the derivative of at zero, then we must evaluate . Since and , we must evaluate 1/0, which is undefined. Therefore, the formula fails in this case. This is not surprising because is not differentiable at zero.

=== Back propagation ===
The chain rule forms the basis of the back propagation algorithm, which is used in gradient descent of neural networks in deep learning (artificial intelligence).

== Higher derivatives ==
Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula generalizes the chain rule to higher derivatives. Assuming that and , then the first few derivatives are:
formula_49

== Proofs ==

=== First proof ===
One proof of the chain rule begins by defining the derivative of the composite function , where we take the limit of the difference quotient for as approaches :
formula_50

Assume for the moment that formula_51 does not equal formula_52 for any formula_53 near formula_54. Then the previous expression is equal to the product of two factors:
formula_55

If formula_56 oscillates near , then it might happen that no matter how close one gets to , there is always an even closer such that . For example, this happens near for the continuous function defined by for and otherwise. Whenever this happens, the above expression is undefined because it involves division by zero. To work around this, introduce a function formula_57 as follows:
formula_58
We will show that the difference quotient for is always equal to:
formula_59

Whenever is not equal to , this is clear because the factors of cancel. When equals , then the difference quotient for is zero because equals , and the above product is zero because it equals times zero. So the above product is always equal to the difference quotient, and to show that the derivative of at exists and to determine its value, we need only show that the limit as goes to of the above product exists and determine its value.

To do this, recall that the limit of a product exists if the limits of its factors exist. When this happens, the limit of the product of these two factors will equal the product of the limits of the factors. The two factors are and . The latter is the difference quotient for at , and because is differentiable at by assumption, its limit as tends to exists and equals .

As for , notice that is defined wherever &#x27; is. Furthermore, &#x27; is differentiable at by assumption, so is continuous at , by definition of the derivative. The function is continuous at because it is differentiable at , and therefore is continuous at . So its limit as &#x27; goes to &#x27; exists and equals , which is .

This shows that the limits of both factors exist and that they equal and , respectively. Therefore, the derivative of at &quot;a&quot; exists and equals .

=== Second proof ===
Another way of proving the chain rule is to measure the error in the linear approximation determined by the derivative. This proof has the advantage that it generalizes to several variables. It relies on the following equivalent definition of differentiability at a point: A function &quot;g&quot; is differentiable at &quot;a&quot; if there exists a real number &quot;g&quot;′(&quot;a&quot;) and a function &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) that tends to zero as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero, and furthermore
formula_60
Here the left-hand side represents the true difference between the value of &quot;g&quot; at &quot;a&quot; and at , whereas the right-hand side represents the approximation determined by the derivative plus an error term.

In the situation of the chain rule, such a function &quot;ε&quot; exists because &quot;g&quot; is assumed to be differentiable at &quot;a&quot;. Again by assumption, a similar function also exists for &quot;f&quot; at &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). Calling this function &quot;η&quot;, we have
formula_61
The above definition imposes no constraints on &quot;η&quot;(0), even though it is assumed that &quot;η&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) tends to zero as &quot;k&quot; tends to zero. If we set , then &quot;η&quot; is continuous at 0.

Proving the theorem requires studying the difference as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero. The first step is to substitute for using the definition of differentiability of &quot;g&quot; at &quot;a&quot;:
formula_62
The next step is to use the definition of differentiability of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). This requires a term of the form for some &quot;k&quot;. In the above equation, the correct &quot;k&quot; varies with &quot;h&quot;. Set and the right hand side becomes . Applying the definition of the derivative gives:
formula_63
To study the behavior of this expression as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero, expand &quot;k&quot;&quot;h&quot;. After regrouping the terms, the right-hand side becomes:
formula_64
Because &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) and &quot;η&quot;(&quot;k&quot;&quot;h&quot;) tend to zero as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero, the first two bracketed terms tend to zero as &quot;h&quot; tends to zero. Applying the same theorem on products of limits as in the first proof, the third bracketed term also tends zero. Because the above expression is equal to the difference , by the definition of the derivative is differentiable at &quot;a&quot; and its derivative is 

The role of &quot;Q&quot; in the first proof is played by &quot;η&quot; in this proof. They are related by the equation:
formula_65
The need to define &quot;Q&quot; at &quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is analogous to the need to define &quot;η&quot; at zero.

=== Third proof ===
Constantin Carathéodory&#x27;s alternative definition of the differentiability of a function can be used to give an elegant proof of the chain rule.

Under this definition, a function is differentiable at a point if and only if there is a function , continuous at and such that . There is at most one such function, and if is differentiable at then .

Given the assumptions of the chain rule and the fact that differentiable functions and compositions of continuous functions are continuous, we have that there exist functions , continuous at , and , continuous at , and such that,
formula_66
and
formula_67
Therefore,
formula_68
but the function given by is continuous at , and we get, for this 
formula_69
A similar approach works for continuously differentiable (vector-)functions of many variables. This method of factoring also allows a unified approach to stronger forms of differentiability, when the derivative is required to be Lipschitz continuous, Hölder continuous, etc. Differentiation itself can be viewed as the polynomial remainder theorem (the little Bézout theorem, or factor theorem), generalized to an appropriate class of functions.

=== Proof via infinitesimals ===

If formula_70 and formula_71 then choosing infinitesimal formula_72 we compute the corresponding formula_73 and then the corresponding formula_74, so that
formula_75
and applying the standard part we obtain
formula_76
which is the chain rule.

== Multivariable case ==
The full generalization of the chain rule to multi-variable functions (such as formula_77) is rather technical. However, it is simpler to write in the case of functions of the form 
formula_78
where formula_79, and formula_80 for each formula_81

As this case occurs often in the study of functions of a single variable, it is worth describing it separately.

===Case of scalar-valued functions with multiple inputs===

Let formula_79, and formula_80 for each formula_81
To write the chain rule for the composition of functions 
formula_85 
one needs the partial derivatives of with respect to its arguments. The usual notations for partial derivatives involve names for the arguments of the function. As these arguments are not named in the above formula, it is simpler and clearer to use &quot;D&quot;-Notation, and to denote by 
formula_86 
the partial derivative of with respect to its th argument, and by 
formula_87
the value of this derivative at .

With this notation, the chain rule is
formula_88

====Example: arithmetic operations====
If the function is addition, that is, if 
formula_89
then formula_90 and formula_91. Thus, the chain rule gives 
formula_92

For multiplication
formula_93
the partials are formula_94 and formula_95. Thus, 
formula_96

The case of exponentiation
formula_97
is slightly more complicated, as 
formula_98
and, as formula_99
formula_100
It follows that 
formula_101

===General rule: Vector-valued functions with multiple inputs===
The simplest way for writing the chain rule in the general case is to use the total derivative, which is a linear transformation that captures all directional derivatives in a single formula. Consider differentiable functions and , and a point in . Let denote the total derivative of at and denote the total derivative of at . These two derivatives are linear transformations and , respectively, so they can be composed. The chain rule for total derivatives is that their composite is the total derivative of at :
formula_102
or for short,
formula_103
The higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.

Because the total derivative is a linear transformation, the functions appearing in the formula can be rewritten as matrices. The matrix corresponding to a total derivative is called a Jacobian matrix, and the composite of two derivatives corresponds to the product of their Jacobian matrices. From this perspective the chain rule therefore says:
formula_104
or for short,
formula_105

That is, the Jacobian of a composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions (evaluated at the appropriate points).

The higher-dimensional chain rule is a generalization of the one-dimensional chain rule. If , , and are 1, so that and , then the Jacobian matrices of and are . Specifically, they are:
formula_106
The Jacobian of is the product of these matrices, so it is , as expected from the one-dimensional chain rule. In the language of linear transformations, is the function which scales a vector by a factor of and is the function which scales a vector by a factor of . The chain rule says that the composite of these two linear transformations is the linear transformation , and therefore it is the function that scales a vector by .

Another way of writing the chain rule is used when &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are expressed in terms of their components as and . In this case, the above rule for Jacobian matrices is usually written as:
formula_107

The chain rule for total derivatives implies a chain rule for partial derivatives. Recall that when the total derivative exists, the partial derivative in the -th coordinate direction is found by multiplying the Jacobian matrix by the -th basis vector. By doing this to the formula above, we find:
formula_108
Since the entries of the Jacobian matrix are partial derivatives, we may simplify the above formula to get:
formula_109
More conceptually, this rule expresses the fact that a change in the direction may change all of through , and any of these changes may affect .

In the special case where , so that is a real-valued function, then this formula simplifies even further:
formula_110
This can be rewritten as a dot product. Recalling that , the partial derivative is also a vector, and the chain rule says that:
formula_111

==== Example ====
Given where and , determine the value of and using the chain rule.
formula_112
and
formula_113

==== Higher derivatives of multivariable functions ====

Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula for higher-order derivatives of single-variable functions generalizes to the multivariable case. If is a function of as above, then the second derivative of is:
formula_114

== Further generalizations ==
All extensions of calculus have a chain rule. In most of these, the formula remains the same, though the meaning of that formula may be vastly different.

One generalization is to manifolds. In this situation, the chain rule represents the fact that the derivative of is the composite of the derivative of and the derivative of . This theorem is an immediate consequence of the higher dimensional chain rule given above, and it has exactly the same formula.

The chain rule is also valid for Fréchet derivatives in Banach spaces. The same formula holds as before. This case and the previous one admit a simultaneous generalization to Banach manifolds.

In differential algebra, the derivative is interpreted as a morphism of modules of Kähler differentials. A ring homomorphism of commutative rings determines a morphism of Kähler differentials which sends an element to , the exterior differential of . The formula holds in this context as well.

The common feature of these examples is that they are expressions of the idea that the derivative is part of a functor. A functor is an operation on spaces and functions between them. It associates to each space a new space and to each function between two spaces a new function between the corresponding new spaces. In each of the above cases, the functor sends each space to its tangent bundle and it sends each function to its derivative. For example, in the manifold case, the derivative sends a -manifold to a -manifold (its tangent bundle) and a -function to its total derivative. There is one requirement for this to be a functor, namely that the derivative of a composite must be the composite of the derivatives. This is exactly the formula .

There are also chain rules in stochastic calculus. One of these, Itō&#x27;s lemma, expresses the composite of an Itō process (or more generally a semimartingale) &quot;dX&quot;&quot;t&quot; with a twice-differentiable function &quot;f&quot;. In Itō&#x27;s lemma, the derivative of the composite function depends not only on &quot;dX&quot;&quot;t&quot; and the derivative of &quot;f&quot; but also on the second derivative of &quot;f&quot;. The dependence on the second derivative is a consequence of the non-zero quadratic variation of the stochastic process, which broadly speaking means that the process can move up and down in a very rough way. This variant of the chain rule is not an example of a functor because the two functions being composed are of different types.

<text>The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.

Here, &quot;quickly&quot; means an algorithm that solves the task and runs in polynomial time (as opposed to, say, exponential time) exists, meaning the task completion time is bounded above by a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm. The general class of questions that some algorithm can answer in polynomial time is &quot;P&quot; or &quot;class P&quot;. For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if provided with an answer, it can be verified quickly. The class of questions where an answer can be &quot;verified&quot; in polynomial time is &quot;NP&quot;, standing for &quot;nondeterministic polynomial time&quot;.

An answer to the P versus NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If P ≠ NP, which is widely believed, it would mean that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.

The problem has been called the most important open problem in computer science. Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.

It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.

== Example ==
Consider the following yes/no problem: given an incomplete Sudoku grid of size formula_1, is there at least one legal solution where every row, column, and formula_2 square contains the integers 1 through formula_3? It is straightforward to verify &quot;yes&quot; instances of this generalized Sudoku problem given a candidate solution. However, it is not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can correctly answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to all instances of this problem. Therefore, generalized Sudoku is in NP (quickly verifiable), but may or may not be in P (quickly solvable). (It is necessary to consider a generalized version of Sudoku, as any fixed size Sudoku has only a finite number of possible grids. In this case the problem is in P, as the answer can be found by table lookup.)

==History==

The precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper &quot;The complexity of theorem proving procedures&quot; (and independently by Leonid Levin in 1973).

Although the P versus NP problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences. In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, speculating that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key. If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical), this would imply what is now called P ≠ NP, since a proposed key can be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time, and pointed out one of the most important consequences—that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.

==Context==
The relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).

In such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is &quot;deterministic&quot; (given the computer&#x27;s present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and &quot;sequential&quot; (it performs actions one after the other).

In this theory, the class P consists of all &quot;decision problems&quot; (defined below) solvable on a deterministic sequential machine in a duration polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all decision problems whose positive solutions are verifiable in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine. Clearly, P ⊆ NP. Arguably, the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes:
:Is P equal to NP?

Since 2002, William Gasarch has conducted three polls of researchers concerning this and related questions. Confidence that P ≠ NP has been increasing – in 2019, 88% believed P ≠ NP, as opposed to 83% in 2012 and 61% in 2002. When restricted to experts, the 2019 answers became 99% believed P ≠ NP. These polls do not imply whether P = NP, Gasarch himself stated: &quot;This does not bring us any closer to solving P=?NP or to knowing when it will be solved, but it attempts to be an objective report on the subjective opinion of this era.&quot;

==NP-completeness==
To attack the P = NP question, the concept of NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete problems are problems that any other NP problem is reducible to in polynomial time and whose solution is still verifiable in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed into any NP-complete problem. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as &quot;tough&quot; as any other problem in NP.

NP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems; i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP; i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.

For instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook–Levin theorem, so &quot;any&quot; instance of &quot;any&quot; problem in NP can be transformed mechanically into a Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P = NP. However, many important problems are NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.

From the definition alone it is unintuitive that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does a polynomial-size input that &quot;M&quot; will accept exist? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether &quot;M&quot; accepts the input by simulating &quot;M&quot;; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine &quot;M&quot; that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.

The first natural problem proven to be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete Latin squares in polynomial time. This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning tri-partite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT, which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability. So a polynomial-time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-problem in polynomial time. Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense &quot;the same problem&quot;.

==Harder problems==
Although it is unknown whether P = NP, problems outside of P are known. Just as the class P is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class EXPTIME is the set of all decision problems that have &quot;exponential&quot; running time. In other words, any problem in EXPTIME is solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in O(2&quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time, where &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a polynomial function of &quot;n&quot;. A decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME, and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. A number of problems are known to be EXPTIME-complete. Because it can be shown that P ≠ EXPTIME, these problems are outside P, and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the time hierarchy theorem, they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess positions on an &quot;N&quot; × &quot;N&quot; board and similar problems for other board games.

The problem of deciding the truth of a statement in Presburger arithmetic requires even more time. Fischer and Rabin proved in 1974 that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements of length &quot;n&quot; has a runtime of at least formula_4 for some constant &quot;c&quot;. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.

It is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems. One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called #P: whereas an NP problem asks &quot;Are there any solutions?&quot;, the corresponding #P problem asks &quot;How many solutions are there?&quot;. Clearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems. For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many. Many of these problems are #P-complete, and hence among the hardest problems in #P, since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other #P problems.

==Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete==

In 1975, Richard E. Ladner showed that if P ≠ NP, then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai, runs in quasi-polynomial time.

The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than &quot;k&quot;. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP = co-NP). The most efficient known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes expected time

:formula_5

to factor an &quot;n&quot;-bit integer. The best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor&#x27;s algorithm, runs in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

==Does P mean &quot;easy&quot;?==

All of the above discussion has assumed that P means &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;not in P&quot; means &quot;difficult&quot;, an assumption known as &quot;Cobham&#x27;s thesis&quot;. It is a common assumption in complexity theory; but there are caveats.

First, it can be false in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents, rendering it impractical. For example, the problem of deciding whether a graph &quot;G&quot; contains &quot;H&quot; as a minor, where &quot;H&quot; is fixed, can be solved in a running time of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2), where &quot;n&quot; is the number of vertices in &quot;G&quot;. However, the big O notation hides a constant that depends superexponentially on &quot;H&quot;. The constant is greater than formula_6 (using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation), and where &quot;h&quot; is the number of vertices in &quot;H&quot;.

On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if P ≠ NP, there may still be effective approaches to the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem, and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low. An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity, it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.

Finally, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which P and NP are defined, such as quantum computation and randomized algorithms.

==Reasons to believe P ≠ NP or P = NP==
Cook provides a restatement of the problem in &quot;The P Versus NP Problem&quot; as &quot;Does P = NP?&quot; According to polls, most computer scientists believe that P ≠ NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3,000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.

It is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but whose solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.
On the other hand, some researchers believe that it is overconfident to believe P ≠ NP and that researchers should also explore proofs of P = NP. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:

===DLIN vs NLIN===
When one substitutes &quot;linear time on a multitape Turing machine&quot; for &quot;polynomial time&quot; in the definitions of P and NP, one obtains the classes DLIN and NLIN.
It is known that DLIN ≠ NLIN.

==Consequences of solution==
One of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the possible answers. Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.

===P = NP===
A proof that P = NP could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. The potential consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.

It is also very possible that a proof would &quot;not&quot; lead to practical algorithms for NP-complete problems. The formulation of the problem does not require that the bounding polynomial be small or even specifically known. A non-constructive proof might show a solution exists without specifying either an algorithm to obtain it or a specific bound. Even if the proof is constructive, showing an explicit bounding polynomial and algorithmic details, if the polynomial is not very low-order the algorithm might not be sufficiently efficient in practice. In this case the initial proof would be mainly of interest to theoreticians, but the knowledge that polynomial time solutions are possible would surely spur research into better (and possibly practical) methods to achieve them.

A solution showing P = NP could upend the field of cryptography, which relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution to an NP-complete problem such as 3-SAT would break most existing cryptosystems including:
* Existing implementations of public-key cryptography, a foundation for many modern security applications such as secure financial transactions over the Internet.
* Symmetric ciphers such as AES or 3DES, used for the encryption of communications data.
* Cryptographic hashing, which underlies blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and is used to authenticate software updates. For these applications, finding a pre-image that hashes to a given value must be difficult, ideally taking exponential time. If P = NP, then this can take polynomial time, through reduction to SAT.
These would need modification or replacement with information-theoretically secure solutions that do not assume P ≠ NP.

There are also enormous benefits that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; making these problems efficiently solvable could considerably advance life sciences and biotechnology.

These changes could be insignificant compared to the revolution that efficiently solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. Gödel, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:

Similarly, Stephen Cook (assuming not only a proof, but a practically efficient algorithm) says:
Research mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem took over three centuries to prove. A method guaranteed to find a proof if a &quot;reasonable&quot; size proof exists, would essentially end this struggle.

Donald Knuth has stated that he has come to believe that P = NP, but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:

===P ≠ NP===
A proof of P ≠ NP would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that P = NP, but would represent a great advance in computational complexity theory and guide future research. It would demonstrate that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.

P ≠ NP still leaves open the average-case complexity of hard problems in NP. For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. Russell Impagliazzo has described five hypothetical &quot;worlds&quot; that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question. These range from &quot;Algorithmica&quot;, where P = NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to &quot;Cryptomania&quot;, where P ≠ NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems. The &quot;world&quot; where P ≠ NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called &quot;Heuristica&quot; in the paper. A Princeton University workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.

==Results about difficulty of proof==
Although the P = NP problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques. In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the P = NP problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are insufficient for answering the question, suggesting novel technical approaches are required.

As additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in computational complexity theory fall into one of the following classifications, all insufficient to prove P ≠ NP:
These barriers are another reason why NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P = NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.

These barriers lead some computer scientists to suggest the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). An independence result could imply that either P ≠ NP and this is unprovable in (e.g.) ZFC, or that P = NP but it is unprovable in ZFC that any polynomial-time algorithms are correct. However, if the problem is undecidable even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms for integer arithmetic, then nearly polynomial-time algorithms exist for all NP problems. Therefore, assuming (as most complexity theorists do) some NP problems don&#x27;t have efficient algorithms, proofs of independence with those techniques are impossible. This also implies proving independence from PA or ZFC with current techniques is no easier than proving all NP problems have efficient algorithms.

==Logical characterizations==
The P = NP problem can be restated as certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in descriptive complexity.

Consider all languages of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear order relation. Then, all such languages in P are expressible in first-order logic with the addition of a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Recursive functions can be defined with this and the order relation. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.

Similarly, NP is the set of languages expressible in existential second-order logic—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question &quot;is P a proper subset of NP&quot; can be reformulated as &quot;is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?&quot;. The word &quot;existential&quot; can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P = NP if and only if P = PH (as the former would establish that NP = co-NP, which in turn implies that NP = PH).

==Polynomial-time algorithms==
No known algorithm for a NP-complete problem runs in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for NP-complete problems that if P = NP, the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to Levin (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if P = NP:

 &quot;// Algorithm that accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM.&quot;
 &quot;// this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if P = NP.&quot;
 &quot;// &quot;Polynomial-time&quot; means it returns &quot;yes&quot; in polynomial time when&quot;
 &quot;// the answer should be &quot;yes&quot;, and runs forever when it is &quot;no&quot;.&quot;
 &quot;// Input: S = a finite set of integers&quot;
 &quot;// Output: &quot;yes&quot; if any subset of S adds up to 0.&quot;
 &quot;// Runs forever with no output otherwise.&quot;
 &quot;// Note: &quot;Program number M&quot; is the program obtained by&quot;
 &quot;// writing the integer M in binary, then&quot;
 &quot;// considering that string of bits to be a&quot;
 &quot;// program. Every possible program can be&quot;
 &quot;// generated this way, though most do nothing&quot;
 &quot;// because of syntax errors.&quot;
 FOR K = 1...∞
 FOR M = 1...K
 Run program number M for K steps with input S
 IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers
 AND the integers are all in S
 AND the integers sum to 0
 THEN
 OUTPUT &quot;yes&quot; and HALT

This is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an NP-complete language only if P = NP. &quot;Accepting&quot; means it gives &quot;yes&quot; answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is &quot;no&quot; (also known as a &quot;semi-algorithm&quot;).

This algorithm is enormously impractical, even if P = NP. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is &quot;b&quot; bits long, the above algorithm will try at least other programs first.

==Formal definitions==

===P and NP===
A &quot;decision problem&quot; is a problem that takes as input some string &quot;w&quot; over an alphabet Σ, and outputs &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If there is an algorithm (say a Turing machine, or a computer program with unbounded memory) that produces the correct answer for any input string of length &quot;n&quot; in at most &quot;cnk&quot; steps, where &quot;k&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in &quot;polynomial time&quot; and we place it in the class P. Formally, P is the set of languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. Meaning,
:formula_7
where
:formula_8
and a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot; that satisfies two conditions:

# &quot;M&quot; halts on all inputs &quot;w&quot; and
# there exists formula_9 such that formula_10, where &quot;O&quot; refers to the big O notation and
::formula_11
::formula_12

NP can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach uses the concept of &quot;certificate&quot; and &quot;verifier&quot;. Formally, NP is the set of languages with a finite alphabet and verifier that runs in polynomial time. The following defines a &quot;verifier&quot;:

Let &quot;L&quot; be a language over a finite alphabet, Σ.

&quot;L&quot; ∈ NP if, and only if, there exists a binary relation formula_13 and a positive integer &quot;k&quot; such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

# For all formula_14, formula_15 such that (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) ∈ &quot;R&quot; and formula_16; and
# the language formula_17 over formula_18 is decidable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.

A Turing machine that decides &quot;LR&quot; is called a &quot;verifier&quot; for &quot;L&quot; and a &quot;y&quot; such that (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) ∈ &quot;R&quot; is called a &quot;certificate of membership&quot; of &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;.

Not all verifiers must be polynomial-time. However, for &quot;L&quot; to be in NP, there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.

====Example====
Let
:formula_19
:formula_20
Whether a value of &quot;x&quot; is composite is equivalent to of whether &quot;x&quot; is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).

COMPOSITE also happens to be in P, a fact demonstrated by the invention of the AKS primality test.

===NP-completeness===
There are many equivalent ways of describing NP-completeness.

Let &quot;L&quot; be a language over a finite alphabet Σ.

&quot;L&quot; is NP-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:

# &quot;L&quot; ∈ NP; and
# any &quot;L&quot;&#x27; in NP is polynomial-time-reducible to &quot;L&quot; (written as formula_21), where formula_21 if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:
## There exists &quot;f&quot; : Σ* → Σ* such that for all &quot;w&quot; in Σ* we have: formula_23; and
## there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) on its tape on any input &quot;w&quot;.

Alternatively, if &quot;L&quot; ∈ NP, and there is another NP-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to &quot;L&quot;, then &quot;L&quot; is NP-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is NP-complete.

==Claimed solutions ==
While the P versus NP problem is generally considered unsolved, many amateur and some professional researchers have claimed solutions. Gerhard J. Woeginger compiled a list of 116 purported proofs from 1986 to 2016, of which 61 were proofs of P = NP, 49 were proofs of P ≠ NP, and 6 proved other results, e.g. that the problem is undecidable. Some attempts at resolving P versus NP have received brief media attention, though these attempts have been refuted.

==Popular culture==
The film &quot;Travelling Salesman&quot;, by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the US government to solve the P versus NP problem.

In the sixth episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ seventh season &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot;, the equation P = NP is seen shortly after Homer accidentally stumbles into the &quot;third dimension&quot;.

In the second episode of season 2 of &quot;Elementary&quot;, &quot;Solve for X&quot; Sherlock and Watson investigate the murders of mathematicians who were attempting to solve P versus NP.

==Similar problems==
* &quot;R vs. RE&quot; problem, where R is analog of class P, and RE is analog class NP. These classes are not equal, because undecidable but verifiable problems do exist, for example, Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem which is RE-complete.
* A similar problem exists in the theory of algebraic complexity: &quot;VP vs. VNP&quot; problem. Like &quot;P vs. NP&quot;, the answer is currently unknown.

<doc id="6117" wikidata="Q187520" url="?curid=6117" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">
<text>Charles Sanders Peirce ( ; September 10, 1839 – April 19, 1914) was an American scientist, mathematician, logician, and philosopher who is sometimes known as &quot;the father of pragmatism&quot;. According to philosopher Paul Weiss, Peirce was &quot;the most original and versatile of America&#x27;s philosophers and America&#x27;s greatest logician&quot;. Bertrand Russell wrote &quot;he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever&quot;. 

Educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years, Peirce meanwhile made major contributions to logic, such as theories of relations and quantification. C. I. Lewis wrote, &quot;The contributions of C. S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century.&quot; For Peirce, logic also encompassed much of what is now called epistemology and the philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics or study of signs, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Peirce&#x27;s study of signs also included a tripartite theory of predication. 

Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulating mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. He was one of the founders of statistics. As early as 1886, he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.

In metaphysics, Peirce was an &quot;objective idealist&quot; in the tradition of German philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as a scholastic realist about universals. He also held a commitment to the ideas of continuity and chance as real features of the universe, views he labeled synechism and tychism respectively. Peirce believed an epistemic fallibilism and anti-skepticism went along with these views. 

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Peirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Harvard University. At age 12, Charles read his older brother&#x27;s copy of Richard Whately&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Logic&quot;, then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning. 

He suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as &quot;facial neuralgia&quot;, which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain &quot;he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper&quot;. Its consequences may have led to the social isolation of his later life.

=== Education ===
Peirce went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree (1862) from Harvard. In 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a Bachelor of Science degree, Harvard&#x27;s first &quot;summa cum laude&quot; chemistry degree. His academic record was otherwise undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard (1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce&#x27;s working life), repeatedly vetoed Peirce&#x27;s employment at the university.

=== United States Coast Survey ===

Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey, which in 1878 was renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, where he enjoyed his highly influential father&#x27;s protection until the latter&#x27;s death in 1880. At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth&#x27;s gravity.

==== American Civil War ====
This employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted. Peirce grew up in a home where white supremacy was taken for granted, and slavery was considered natural. Peirce&#x27;s father had described himself as a secessionist until the outbreak of the war, after which he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. 

Peirce liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic (for the first premise arguably assumes the conclusion):&lt;poem&gt;
All Men are equal in their political rights.
Negroes are Men.
Therefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.&lt;/poem&gt;

==== Travels to Europe ====
He was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse. There, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford, British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. 

==== Harvard observatory ====
From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an assistant in Harvard&#x27;s astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way. In 1872 he founded the Metaphysical Club, a conversational philosophical club that Peirce, the future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the philosopher and psychologist William James, amongst others, formed in January 1872 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and dissolved in December 1872. Other members of the club included Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Nicholas St. John Green, and Joseph Bangs Warner. The discussions eventually birthed Peirce&#x27;s notion of pragmatism.

==== National Academy of Sciences ====

On April 20, 1877, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency, the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983.

In 1879 Peirce developed Peirce quincuncial projection, having been inspired by H. A. Schwarz&#x27;s 1869 conformal transformation of a circle onto a polygon of &quot;n&quot; sides (known as the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping). 

==== 1880 to 1891 ====
During the 1880s, Peirce&#x27;s indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work&#x27;s quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands, during 1883–1909 on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic &quot;Century Dictionary&quot;. In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds. In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall&#x27;s request.

=== Johns Hopkins University ===
In 1879, Peirce was appointed lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J. J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce&#x27;s work on mathematics and logic). His &quot;Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University&quot; (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students. Peirce&#x27;s nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.

Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Newcomb had been a favourite student of Peirce&#x27;s father; although &quot;no doubt quite bright&quot;, &quot;like Salieri in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s Amadeus he also had just enough talent to recognize he was not a genius and just enough pettiness to resent someone who was&quot;. Additionally &quot;an intensely devout and literal-minded Christian of rigid moral standards&quot;, he was appalled by what he considered Peirce&#x27;s personal shortcomings. Peirce&#x27;s efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as &quot;his difficult personality&quot;. In contrast, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce&#x27;s work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.

=== Personal life ===

Peirce&#x27;s personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (&quot;Zina&quot;), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remains uncertain. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success. He had no children by either marriage.

=== Later life and poverty ===

In 1887, Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property &quot;Arisbe&quot;. There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives, Charles writing prolifically, with much of his work remaining unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. Charles spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.

Peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for &quot;The Nation&quot; (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley&#x27;s instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley&#x27;s research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete several books. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.

From 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal &quot;The Monist&quot;, which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce. He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology&quot; (1901–1905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision. He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book describing his life&#x27;s work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Carnegie Institution executive committee, and its president had been president of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce&#x27;s dismissal.

The one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his &quot;Will to Believe&quot; (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James&#x27;s death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James&#x27;s eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used &quot;Santiago&quot; (&quot;St. James&quot; in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).

==Death and legacy==
Peirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce&#x27;s ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot arranged for Juliette&#x27;s burial in Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce&#x27;s ashes was interred with Juliette.

Bertrand Russell (1959) wrote &quot;Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever&quot;. Russell and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce (Peirce&#x27;s work was not widely known until later). A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce&#x27;s unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own &quot;process&quot; thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964.) Karl Popper viewed Peirce as &quot;one of the greatest philosophers of all times&quot;. Yet Peirce&#x27;s achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah Royce admired him and Cassius Jackson Keyser, at Columbia and C. K. Ogden, wrote about Peirce with respect but to no immediate effect.

The first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce&#x27;s student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce&#x27;s writings entitled &quot;Chance, Love, and Logic&quot; (1923), and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce&#x27;s scattered writings. John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins. From 1916 onward, Dewey&#x27;s writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot; is much influenced by Peirce. The publication of the first six volumes of &quot;Collected Papers&quot; (1931–1935) was the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds; however it did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 PhD thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its &quot;Transactions&quot;, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism and American philosophy has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism.)

By 1943 such was Peirce&#x27;s reputation, in the US at least, that &quot;Webster&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary&quot; said that Peirce was &quot;now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time&quot;.

In 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her forty years of research on Peirce, “the mathematician and scientist,” culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). In 1952, the Scottish philosopher W. B. Gallie had his book &quot;Peirce and pragmatism&quot; published, which introduced the work of Peirce to an international readership. A.J. Ayer, the English philosopher, provided the Editorial Foreword to Gallie&#x27;s book. In it he credited Peirce&#x27;s philosophy as being &#x27;not only of great historical significance, as one of the original sources of American pragmatism, but also extremely important in itself.&#x27; Ayer concluded: &#x27;it is clear from Professor Gallie’s exposition of his doctrines that he is a philosopher from whom we still have much to learn.&#x27;

Beginning around 1960, Max Fisch (1900-1995), the philosopher and historian of ideas, emerged as an authority on Peirce (Fisch, 1986). He included many of his relevant articles in a survey (Fisch 1986: 422–448) of the impact of Peirce&#x27;s thought through 1983.

Peirce has gained an international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP and Centro de Estudos de Pragmatismo), Finland (HPRC and ), Germany (Wirth&#x27;s group, Hoffman&#x27;s and Otte&#x27;s group, and Deuser&#x27;s and Härle&#x27;s group), France (L&#x27;I.R.S.C.E.), Spain (GEP), and Italy (CSP). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirce scholars of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto, thanks in part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) –, and Pennsylvania State University.

In recent years, Peirce&#x27;s of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks.

John Deely writes that Peirce was the last of the &quot;moderns&quot; and &quot;first of the postmoderns&quot;. He lauds Peirce&#x27;s doctrine of signs as a contribution to the dawn of the Postmodern epoch. Deely additionally comments that &quot;Peirce stands...in a position analogous to the position occupied by Augustine as last of the Western Fathers and first of the medievals&quot;.

==Works==

Peirce&#x27;s reputation rests largely on academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as &quot;Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Speculative Philosophy&quot;, &quot;The Monist&quot;, &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;, the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime was &quot;Photometric Researches&quot; (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited &quot;Studies in Logic&quot; (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce.

After Peirce&#x27;s death, Harvard University obtained from Peirce&#x27;s widow the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967) catalogued this &quot;Nachlass&quot; did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1,650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000 pages, mostly still unpublished except on microfilm. On the vicissitudes of Peirce&#x27;s papers, see Houser (1989). Reportedly the papers remain in unsatisfactory condition.

The first published anthology of Peirce&#x27;s articles was the one-volume &quot;Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays&quot;, edited by Morris Raphael Cohen, 1923, still in print. Other one-volume anthologies were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions of Peirce&#x27;s works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:

1931–1958: &quot;Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce&quot; (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce&#x27;s work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce&#x27;s development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors&#x27; notes. Edited (1–6) by Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss and (7–8) by Arthur Burks, in print and online.

1975–1987: &quot;Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to&quot; The Nation, 4 volumes, includes Peirce&#x27;s more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869–1908 in &quot;The Nation&quot;. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner and James Edward Cook, online.

1976: &quot;The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce&quot;, 4 volumes in 5, included many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce&#x27;s important published mathematical articles. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1977: &quot;Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C. S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby&quot; (2nd edition 2001), included Peirce&#x27;s entire correspondence (1903–1912) with Victoria, Lady Welby. Peirce&#x27;s other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the &quot;Collected Papers&quot;, and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the &quot;Writings&quot;. Edited by Charles S. Hardwick with James Cook, out of print.

1982–now: &quot;Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition&quot; (W), Volumes 1–6 &amp; 8, of a projected 30. The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the &quot;Collected Papers&quot; led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the Peirce Edition Project (PEP), whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition. Only seven volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859 to 1892, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. &quot;Writings of Charles S. Peirce&quot;, 8 was published in November 2010; and work continues on &quot;Writings of Charles S. Peirce&quot;, 7, 9, and 11. In print and online.

1985: &quot;Historical Perspectives on Peirce&#x27;s Logic of Science: A History of Science&quot;, 2 volumes. Auspitz has said, &quot;The extent of Peirce&#x27;s immersion in the science of his day is evident in his reviews in the &quot;Nation&quot; [...] and in his papers, grant applications, and publishers&#x27; prospectuses in the history and practice of science&quot;, referring latterly to &quot;Historical Perspectives&quot;. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1992: &quot;Reasoning and the Logic of Things&quot; collects in one place Peirce&#x27;s 1898 series of lectures invited by William James. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner, with commentary by Hilary Putnam, in print.

1992–1998: &quot;The Essential Peirce&quot; (EP), 2 volumes, is an important recent sampler of Peirce&#x27;s philosophical writings. Edited (1) by Nathan Hauser and Christian Kloesel and (2) by &quot;Peirce Edition Project&quot; editors, in print.

1997: &quot;Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking&quot; collects Peirce&#x27;s 1903 Harvard &quot;Lectures on Pragmatism&quot; in a study edition, including drafts, of Peirce&#x27;s lecture manuscripts, which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in &quot;The Essential Peirce&quot;, 2. Edited by Patricia Ann Turisi, in print.

2010: &quot;Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Writings&quot; collects important writings by Peirce on the subject, many not previously in print. Edited by Matthew E. Moore, in print.

==Mathematics==
Peirce&#x27;s most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity.

He worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections, and was especially active in probability and statistics.

;Discoveries
↓ The Peirce arrow, &lt;br&gt;symbol for &quot;(neither) ... nor ...&quot;, also called the &quot;Quine dagger&quot;
Peirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:

In 1860, he suggested a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers, years before any work by Georg Cantor (who completed his dissertation in 1867) and without access to Bernard Bolzano&#x27;s 1851 (posthumous) &quot;Paradoxien des Unendlichen&quot;.

In 1880–1881, he showed how Boolean algebra could be done via a repeated sufficient single binary operation (logical NOR), anticipating Henry M. Sheffer by 33 years. (See also De Morgan&#x27;s Laws.)

In 1881, he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic, a few years before Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as &quot;Dedekind-finite&quot;, and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.

In 1885, he distinguished between first-order and second-order quantification. In the same paper he set out what can be read as the first (primitive) axiomatic set theory, anticipating Zermelo by about two decades (Brady 2000, pp. 132–133).

In 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches, anticipating Claude Shannon by more than 50 years. 
By the later 1890s he was devising existential graphs, a diagrammatic notation for the predicate calculus. Based on them are John F. Sowa&#x27;s conceptual graphs and Sun-Joo Shin&#x27;s diagrammatic reasoning.

;&quot;The New Elements of Mathematics&quot;

Peirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title &quot;The New Elements of Mathematics&quot;, that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in &quot;The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce&quot; (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.

;Nature of mathematics

Peirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science &quot;about&quot; drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.

===Mathematics of logic===
Mathematical logic and foundations, some noted articles
* &quot;On an Improvement in Boole&#x27;s Calculus of Logic&quot; (1867)
* &quot;Description of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives&quot; (1870)
* &quot;On the Algebra of Logic&quot; (1880)
* &quot;A Boolian Algebra with One Constant&quot; (1880 MS)
* &quot;On the Logic of Number&quot; (1881)
* &quot;Note B: The Logic of Relatives&quot; (1883)
* &quot;On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation&quot; (1884/1885)
* &quot;The Logic of Relatives&quot; (1897)
* &quot;The Simplest Mathematics&quot; (1902 MS)
* &quot;Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism&quot; (1906, on existential graphs)

===Probability and statistics===
Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (&quot;absolute chance&quot;) is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization. Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the &quot;propensity&quot; theory of probability before Karl Popper. Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, &quot;perhaps the very first&quot; elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.

Peirce formulated modern statistics in &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; (1877–1878) and &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884 (Hacking 1990:205) (before Ronald A. Fisher). He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he &quot;corrected the means&quot;. He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father. He introduced the terms &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;likelihood&quot; (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler&#x27;s historical books and Ian Hacking 1990.)

== As a philosopher ==
Peirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.

Peirce&#x27;s philosophy includes a pervasive three-category system: belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry&#x27;s ways—including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method—and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love. In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others&#x27; work. However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity, and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–457).

For Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.

Peirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics, but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences. He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.

===Influence and legacy===
Umberto Eco described Peirce as &quot;undoubtedly the greatest unpublished writer of our generation&quot; and by Karl Popper as &quot;one of the greatest philosophers of all time&quot;. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy says of Peirce that although &quot;long considered an eccentric figure whose contribution to pragmatism was to provide its name and whose importance was as an influence upon James and Dewey, Peirce&#x27;s significance in his own right is now largely accepted.&quot;

Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:

As a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as &quot;&quot; (1877) and especially &quot;&quot; (1878) as foundational to pragmatism. Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (&quot;&quot;, 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism &quot;for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition&quot;, saying that &quot;all went happily&quot; with James&#x27;s and F.C.S. Schiller&#x27;s variant uses of the old name &quot;pragmatism&quot; and that he coined the new name because of the old name&#x27;s growing use in &quot;literary journals, where it gets abused&quot;. Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini&#x27;s declaration of pragmatism&#x27;s indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.

Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object&#x27;s effects to a general extent of the effects&#x27; conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series of articles. In the second one, &quot;&quot;, Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:

# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
# Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea &quot;distinct&quot;, that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition &quot;nominal&quot; (CP 5.553).
# Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object&#x27;s conceived effects, such that fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the pragmatic maxim.

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness&#x27;s second grade (the &quot;nominal&quot; grade), he defined truth as a sign&#x27;s correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness&#x27;s third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which &quot;would&quot; be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.

Peirce said that a conception&#x27;s meaning consists in &quot;all general modes of rational conduct&quot; implied by &quot;acceptance&quot; of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception&#x27;s meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to &quot;vulgar&quot; pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.

Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry, which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

===Theory of inquiry===
In &quot;&quot; (1877), Peirce gives his take on the psychological origin and aim of inquiry. On his view, individuals are motivated to inquiry by desire to escape the feelings of anxiety and unease which Peirce takes to be characteristic of the state of doubt. Doubt is described by Peirce as an &quot;uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to free ourselves and pass into the state of belief.&quot; Peirce uses words like &quot;irritation&quot; to describe the experience of being in doubt and to explain why he thinks we find such experiences to be motivating. The irritating feeling of doubt is appeased, Peirce says, through our efforts to achieve a settled state of satisfaction with what we land on as our answer to the question which led to that doubt in the first place. This settled state, namely, belief, is described by Peirce as &quot;a calm and satisfactory state which we do not wish to avoid.&quot; Our efforts to achieve the satisfaction of belief, by whichever methods we may pursue, are what Peirce calls &quot;inquiry&quot;. Four methods which Peirce describes as having been actually pursued throughout the history of thought are summarized below in the section after next. 

====Critical common-sensism====
Critical common-sensism, treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid&#x27;s common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to raise genuine doubts in tests for a core group of common indubitables that change slowly, if at all.

====Rival methods of inquiry====
In &quot;&quot; (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth &quot;per se&quot; but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:

# The method of (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others&#x27; views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another&#x27;s opinion seems as good as one&#x27;s own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of &quot;what is agreeable to reason&quot;. Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of – wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong (fallibilism), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research, which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason&#x27;s &quot;first rule&quot; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive—eventually—at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth &quot;per se&quot; but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief&#x27;s integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

====Scientific method====
Insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or &quot;rationalism&quot;; and induction from experiential phenomena, or &quot;empiricism&quot;.

Based on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce&#x27;s approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:

# Active, abductive genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;
# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;
# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: &quot;prediction&quot; and &quot;control&quot;.

Thereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization &quot;simpliciter&quot;, which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.

A theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.

Peirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.

Abduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.

Peirce&#x27;s outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of &quot;A Neglected Argument&quot; is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments).

# &quot;Abductive&quot; (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the &quot;facile and natural&quot;, as by Galileo&#x27;s natural light of reason and as distinct from &quot;logical simplicity&quot;. Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths. In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism &quot;the logic of abduction&quot;. Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity. One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.

# &quot;Deductive&quot; phase. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.
:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, Euclidean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.

# &quot;Inductive&quot; phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real &quot;is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead&quot;; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows &quot;a method which, sufficiently persisted in&quot;, will &quot;diminish the error below any predesignate degree&quot;. Three stages:
:i. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also &quot;Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce&quot;, 7.114–120). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;S&quot; is found actually accompanied by &quot;P&quot; that was predicted for &quot;S&quot; (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.
:iii. Sentential Induction. &quot;...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result&quot;.

====Against Cartesianism====
Peirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities—no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable—to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:

# &quot;It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt&quot; – when, instead, we start with preconceptions, &quot;prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us &quot;can&quot; be questioned&quot;, though we may find reason to question them later. &quot;Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.&quot;
# &quot;It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness&quot; – when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy&#x27;s multi-generational dream. When &quot;candid and disciplined minds&quot; continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory&#x27;s author should feel doubts about it.
# It trusts to &quot;a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses&quot; – when, instead, philosophy should, &quot;like the successful sciences&quot;, proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to &quot;the multitude and variety of its arguments&quot; as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but &quot;a cable whose fibers&quot;, soever &quot;slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected&quot;.
# It renders many facts &quot;absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that &#x27;God makes them so&#x27; is to be regarded as an explanation&quot; – when, instead, philosophy should avoid being &quot;unidealistic&quot;, misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, &quot;some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate&quot;, which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.

==Theory of categories==
On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled &quot;On a New List of Categories&quot; to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life. Peirce scholars generally regard the &quot;New List&quot; as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce&#x27;s &quot;architectonic&quot;, his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in &quot;&quot; (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.

 is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works. In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience. 

== Logic, or semiotic ==
In 1918, the logician C. I. Lewis wrote, &quot;The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century.&quot; 

=== Relational logic ===
Beginning with his first paper on the &quot;Logic of Relatives&quot; (1870), Peirce extended the theory of relations pioneered by Augustus De Morgan. Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce&#x27;s larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra.

Relational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral student of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in &quot;Social Choice and Individual Values&quot;, following Arrow&#x27;s association with Tarski at City College of New York.

=== Quantifiers ===
On Peirce and his contemporaries Ernst Schröder and Gottlob Frege, Hilary Putnam (1982) documented that Frege&#x27;s work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce&#x27;s &quot;On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation&quot; (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce&#x27;s notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege&#x27;s work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics.

Peirce&#x27;s work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schröder:
* Philosophical algebraist William Kingdon Clifford and logician William Ernest Johnson, both British;
* The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including Alfred Tarski;
* Arthur Prior, who praised and studied Peirce&#x27;s logical work in a 1964 paper and in &quot;Formal Logic&quot; (saying on page 4 that Peirce &quot;perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since&quot;).

=== Philosophy of logic ===
A philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce&#x27;s writings and, along with Peirce&#x27;s logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982); the Introduction in Nathan Houser &quot;et al.&quot; (1997); and Randall Dipert&#x27;s chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).

==== Logic as philosophical ====
Peirce regarded logic &quot;per se&quot; as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as &quot;the art of devising methods of research&quot;. More generally, as inference, &quot;logic is rooted in the social principle&quot;, since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) &quot;mathematics of logic&quot; much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply &quot;logic&quot;. He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic&#x27;s mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.

Peirce argued that logic is formal semiotic: the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that &quot;all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs&quot;, along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs and sign processes (&quot;semiosis&quot;) such as the inquiry process. He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.

==== Presuppositions of logic ====
In his &quot;F.R.L.&quot; [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and &quot;in one sense, the sole&quot;, rule of reason is that, &quot;to learn, one needs to desire to learn&quot; and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think. So, the first rule is, &quot;to wonder&quot;. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:

&lt;poem&gt;...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
::Do not block the way of inquiry.&lt;/poem&gt;

Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that &quot;the one unpardonable offence&quot; is a philosophical barricade against truth&#x27;s advance, an offense to which &quot;metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted&quot;. Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).

Peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of &quot;fallibilism&quot;, which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic&#x27;s presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).

The First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind&#x27;s presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic; presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.

==== Four incapacities ====
The &quot;Journal of Speculative Philosophy&quot; series (1868–1869), including
* Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man (1868)
* Some Consequences of Four Incapacities (1868)
* Grounds of Validity of the Laws of Logic:&lt;br&gt;Further Consequences of Four Incapacities (1869) In three articles in 1868–1869, Peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them):
# No power of Introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.
# No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.
# No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.
# No conception of the absolutely incognizable.
(The above sense of the term &quot;intuition&quot; is almost Kant&#x27;s, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)

Peirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning, and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below).

Peirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to &quot;dismiss make-believes&quot; is a prerequisite for pragmatism.

==== Logic as formal semiotic ====
Peirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought&#x27;s processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying &#x27;how science works&#x27; and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle&#x27;s work, in such &quot;loci&quot; as: the basic terminology of psychology in &quot;On the Soul&quot;; the founding description of sign relations in &quot;On Interpretation&quot;; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as &quot;abduction&quot;, &quot;deduction&quot;, and &quot;induction&quot;, in the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, as well as inference by analogy (called &quot;paradeigma&quot; by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.

Peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both &quot;semiotic&quot; and &quot;semeiotic&quot;. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined &quot;semiosis&quot; as &quot;action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of &quot;three&quot; subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs&quot;. As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: &quot;To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.&quot;

Peirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where &quot;sign&quot; is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or &quot;quasi-mind&quot;, that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees—the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).

Inquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics&#x27; three levels:

Peirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:

== Signs ==


=== Sign relation ===
Peirce&#x27;s theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign—not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The &quot;sign relation&quot; is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign&#x27;s subject matter, called its &quot;object&quot;, and (3) the sign&#x27;s meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its &quot;interpretant&quot; (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible &quot;triadic relation&quot;, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.

&quot;Extension × intension = information.&quot; Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of &quot;extension&quot; (a sign&#x27;s objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of &quot;intension&quot; (the objects&#x27; characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of &quot;information&quot;, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term&#x27;s total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term &#x27;intends&#x27; or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term &#x27;extends&#x27; or applies.

&quot;Determination.&quot; A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object—the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object—an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something &quot;as&quot; a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one&#x27;s collateral experience with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word &quot;determine&quot; not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of &quot;specializes&quot;, &quot;bestimmt&quot;, involving variable amount, like an influence. Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination. The object determines the sign to determine another sign—the interpretant—to be related to the object &quot;as the sign is related to the object&quot;, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.

=== Semiotic elements ===
Peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):

# A &quot;sign&quot; (or &quot;representamen&quot;) represents, in the broadest possible sense of &quot;represents&quot;. It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization. As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined &quot;sign&quot; at least 76 times), the sign stands &quot;for&quot; the object &quot;to&quot; the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign&#x27;s &quot;ground&quot;.
# An &quot;object&quot; (or &quot;semiotic object&quot;) is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet. All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the universe of discourse to which the partial or special object belongs. For instance, a perturbation of Pluto&#x27;s orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is &quot;immediate&quot; to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a &quot;dynamic&quot; object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded &quot;as on bedrock&quot;.
# An &quot;interpretant&quot; (or &quot;interpretant sign&quot;) is a sign&#x27;s meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant&#x27;s &quot;predecessor&quot; (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is &quot;immediate&quot; to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word&#x27;s usual meaning, or (ii) is a &quot;dynamic&quot; interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a &quot;final&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign &quot;would&quot; have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.
Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign&#x27;s object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.

=== Classes of signs ===
Among Peirce&#x27;s many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce&#x27;s three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.

I. &quot;Qualisign, sinsign, legisign&quot; (also called&quot; tone, token, type,&quot; and also called &quot;potisign, actisign, famisign&quot;): This typology classifies every sign according to the sign&#x27;s own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a &quot;First&quot;; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a &quot;Second&quot;; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a &quot;Third&quot;.

II. &quot;Icon, index, symbol&quot;: This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign&#x27;s way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.

III. &quot;Rheme, dicisign, argument&quot; (also called &quot;sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,&quot; also &quot;seme, pheme, delome,&quot; and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional &quot;term, proposition, argument&quot;): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign&#x27;s way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.

Every sign belongs to one class or another within (I) &quot;and&quot; within (II) &quot;and&quot; within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

== Modes of inference ==
Borrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference—&quot;abduction&quot;, &quot;deduction&quot;, and &quot;induction&quot;—in his &quot;critique of arguments&quot; or &quot;logic proper&quot;. Peirce also called abduction &quot;retroduction&quot;, &quot;presumption&quot;, and, earliest of all, &quot;hypothesis&quot;. He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in &quot;Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis&quot; (1878). He does this by rearranging the &quot;rule&quot; (Barbara&#x27;s major premise), the &quot;case&quot; (Barbara&#x27;s minor premise), and the &quot;result&quot; (Barbara&#x27;s conclusion):

Deduction.

&quot;Rule:&quot; All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Case:&quot; These beans are beans from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
formula_1 &quot;Result:&quot; These beans are white.

Induction.

&quot;Case:&quot; These beans are [randomly selected] from this bag.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Result:&quot; These beans are white.&lt;br&gt;
formula_1 &quot;Rule:&quot; All the beans from this bag are white.

Hypothesis (Abduction).

&quot;Rule:&quot; All the beans from this bag are white.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Result:&quot; These beans [oddly] are white.&lt;br&gt;
formula_1 &quot;Case:&quot; These beans are from this bag.
In 1883, in &quot;A Theory of Probable Inference&quot; (&quot;Studies in Logic&quot;), Peirce equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:

The logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. &quot;Deduction proves that something &quot;must&quot; be; Induction shows that something &quot;actually is&quot; operative; Abduction merely suggests that something &quot;may be&quot;.&quot; Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction. In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing

== Metaphysics ==
Peirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.

=== Ontology ===
On the issue of universals, Peirce was a scholastic realist, declaring the reality of generals as early as 1868. According to Peirce, his category he called &quot;thirdness&quot;, the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities. Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 &quot;The Logic of Relatives&quot; he wrote:

Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they &quot;would&quot; behave under certain circumstances.

==== Continua ====
Continuity and synechism are central in Peirce&#x27;s philosophy: &quot;I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy&quot;.

From a mathematical point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of &quot;analysis situs&quot; (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any Aleph number (any infinite &quot;multitude&quot; as he called it) of instants.

In 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): &quot;It is on 26 May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.&quot;

=== Psychical or religious metaphysics ===
Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits—and it is a belief in God not as an &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;existent&quot; being (in Peirce&#x27;s sense of those words), but all the same as a &quot;real&quot; being. In &quot;&quot; (1908), Peirce sketches, for God&#x27;s reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will &quot;stand or fall with the hypothesis&quot;; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an &quot;infinitely incomprehensible&quot; being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be &quot;more&quot; false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.

=== Physical metaphysics ===
Peirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that &quot;matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws&quot;. Peirce observed that &quot;Berkeley&#x27;s metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop&quot;. 

Peirce asserted the reality of (1) &quot;absolute chance&quot; or randomness (his tychist view), (2) &quot;mechanical necessity&quot; or physical laws (anancist view), and (3) what he called the &quot;law of love&quot; (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called &quot;sporting&quot;), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called &quot;tychasm&quot;, &quot;anancasm&quot;, and &quot;agapasm&quot;) of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity, especially of space, time, and law.

== Philosophy of science ==
Peirce outlined two fields, &quot;Cenoscopy&quot; and &quot;Science of Review&quot;, both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science. In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus: 

# Science of Discovery.
## Mathematics.
## Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article – categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the &quot;general&quot; study of inquiry and scientific method.
## Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).
# Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges &quot;... the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science&quot;. His examples included Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Cosmos&quot;, Comte&#x27;s &quot;Philosophie positive&quot;, and Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Synthetic Philosophy&quot;.
# Practical Science, or the Arts.

Peirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath&#x27;s survey of research in his time.

<text>A Carnot heat engine is a theoretical heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857, work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates.

A heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.

Every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.

The Carnot engine is a theoretical construct, useful for exploring the efficiency limits of other heat engines. An actual Carnot engine, however, would be completely impractical to build.

== Carnot&#x27;s diagram ==
In the adjacent diagram, from Carnot&#x27;s 1824 work, &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, there are &quot;two bodies &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, kept each at a constant temperature, that of &quot;A&quot; being higher than that of &quot;B&quot;. These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.&quot; Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., &quot;work&quot;, by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body &quot;A&quot; to body &quot;B&quot;.
It also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator.

== Modern diagram ==
The previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the &quot;working body&quot; (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat &quot;Q&quot; can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, air, etc. Although in those early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically &quot;Q&quot;H was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; &quot;Q&quot;C was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work, &quot;W&quot;, is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as &quot;weight lifted through a height&quot;.
==Carnot cycle==


The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:

# Reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the &quot;hot&quot; temperature, (isothermal heat addition or absorption). During this step ( to ) the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings. The temperature of the gas (the system) does not change during the process, and thus the expansion is isothermic. The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy and of entropy from the high temperature reservoir.
# Isentropic (reversible adiabatic) expansion of the gas (isentropic work output). For this step ( to ) the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated, thus they neither gain nor lose heat. The gas continues to expand, doing work on the surroundings, and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy. The gas expansion causes it to cool to the &quot;cold&quot; temperature, . The entropy remains unchanged.
# Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the &quot;cold&quot; temperature, (isothermal heat rejection) ( to ). Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it (such as through the return compression of a piston), while causing an amount of waste heat (with the standard sign convention for heat) and of entropy to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir. (In magnitude, this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step 1. The entropy decreases in isothermal compression since the multiplicity of the system decreases with the volume.) In terms of magnitude, the recompression work performed by the surroundings in this step is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step 1 because it occurs at a lower pressure due to the lower temperature (i.e. the resistance to compression is lower under step 3 than the force of expansion under step 1). We can refer to the first law of thermodynamics to explain this behavior: .
# Isentropic compression of the gas (isentropic work input) ( to ). Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed. During this step, the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed. This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas, compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to . The entropy remains unchanged. At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step 1.

== Carnot&#x27;s theorem ==

Carnot&#x27;s theorem is a formal statement of this fact: &quot;No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.&quot;

formula_1

===Explanation===
This maximum efficiency is defined as above:
* is the work done by the system (energy exiting the system as work),
* is the heat put into the system (heat energy entering the system),
* is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir, and
* is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir.

A corollary to Carnot&#x27;s theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.

It is easily shown that the efficiency is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of system and surroundings (the entropies of the hot furnace, the &quot;working fluid&quot; of the heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the &quot;working fluid&quot; completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process, the total entropy of this combined system would increase.)

Since the &quot;working fluid&quot; comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function, the change in entropy of the &quot;working fluid&quot; system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.

The coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.

== Efficiency of real heat engines ==
For a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.

The internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system is equal to the net heat put into the system, the sum of formula_2 &gt; 0 taken up and the waste heat formula_3 &lt; 0 given off:

For real engines, stages 1 and 3 of the Carnot cycle, in which heat is absorbed by the &quot;working fluid&quot; from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively, no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.

During heat transfer from the hot reservoir at formula_4 to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than formula_4, and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. 
Let formula_6 be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat.

 \frac{\text{d}Q_\text{H}}{T} &lt;/math&gt; |LnSty=1px dashed |3}}

where the temperature of the fluid is always slightly lesser than formula_4, in this process.

So, one would get:

{T_\text{H}}=\frac{\int \text{d}Q_\text{H}}{T_\text{H}} \leq \Delta S_\text{H} &lt;/math&gt; |LnSty=1px dashed |4}}

Similarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change formula_8&lt; 0 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:

{T_\text{C}}&lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; |LnSty=1px dashed |5}}

where, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid is always slightly greater than formula_9.

We have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here. Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have

The previous three equations, namely (), (), (), substituted into () to give:

{T_\text{C}}\geqslant\frac{Q_\text{H}}{T_\text{H}}&lt;/math&gt; |LnSty=1px dashed |7}}
For [ΔSh ≥ (Qh/Th)] +[ΔSc ≥ (Qc/Tc)] = 0

[ΔSh ≥ (Qh/Th)] = - [ΔSc ≥ (Qc/Tc)]

= [-ΔSc &quot;≤&quot; (-Qc/Tc)]

it is at least (Qh/Th) &quot;≤&quot; (-Qc/Tc)

Equations () and () combine to give

 \leq 1- \frac{T_\text{C}}{T_\text{H}} &lt;/math&gt; |LnSty=1px dashed |8}}

To derive this step needs two adiabatic processes involved to show an isentropic process property for the ratio of the changing volumes of two isothermal processes are equal. 

Most importantly, since the two adiabatic processes are volume works without heat lost, and since the ratio of volume changes for this two processes are the same, so the works for these two adiabatic processes are the same with opposite direction to each other, namely, one direction is work done by the system and the other is work done on the system; therefore, heat efficiency only concerns the amount of work done by the heat absorbed comparing to the amount of heat absorbed by the system.

Therefore, (W/Qh) = (Qh - Qc) / Qh

= 1 - (Qc/Qh)

= 1 - (Tc/Th)

And, from ()

(Qh/Th) &quot;≤&quot; (-Qc/Tc) here Qc it is less than 0 (release heat) 

(Tc/Th) &quot;≤&quot; (-Qc/Qh)

-(Tc/Th) ≥ (Qc/Qh)

&quot;1+&quot;[-(Tc/Th)] ≥ &quot;1+&quot;(Qc/Qh) 

1 - (Tc/Th) ≥ (Qh + Qc)/Qh here Qc&lt;0, 

1 - (Tc/Th) ≥ (Qh - Qc)/Qh

1 - (Tc/Th) ≥ W/Qh

Hence,

where formula_10 is the efficiency of the real engine, and formula_11 is the efficiency of the Carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures formula_4 and formula_9. For the Carnot engine, the entire process is &#x27;reversible&#x27;, and Equation () is an equality. Hence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.

Equation () signifies that the total entropy of system and surroundings (the fluid and the two reservoirs) increases for the real engine, because (in a surroundings-based analysis) the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as formula_14 flows into it at the fixed temperature formula_9, is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as formula_16 leaves it at its fixed temperature formula_4. The inequality in Equation () is essentially the statement of the Clausius theorem.

According to the second theorem, &quot;The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance&quot;.

==The Carnot engine and Rudolf Diesel==
In 1892 Rudolf Diesel patented an internal combustion engine inspired by the Carnot engine. Diesel knew a Carnot engine is an ideal that cannot be built, but he thought he had invented a working approximation. His principle was unsound, but in his struggle to implement it he developed a practical Diesel engine.

The conceptual problem was how to achieve isothermal expansion in an internal combustion engine, since burning fuel at the highest temperature of the cycle would only raise the temperature further. Diesel&#x27;s patented solution was: having achieved the highest temperature just by compressing the air, to add a small amount of fuel at a controlled rate, such that heating caused by burning the fuel would be counteracted by cooling caused by air expansion as the piston moved. Hence all the heat from the fuel would be transformed into work during the isothermal expansion, as required by Carnot&#x27;s theorem.

For the idea to work a small mass of fuel would have to be burnt in a huge mass of air. Diesel first proposed a working engine that would compress air to 250 atmospheres at , then cycle to one atmosphere at . However, this was well beyond the technological capabilities of the day, since it implied a compression ratio of 60:1. Such an engine, if it could have been built, would have had an efficiency of 73%. (In contrast, the best steam engines of his day achieved 7%.)

Accordingly, Diesel sought to compromise. He calculated that, were he to reduce the peak pressure to a less ambitious 90 atmospheres, he would sacrifice only 5% of the thermal efficiency. Seeking financial support, he published the &quot;Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine to Take the Place of the Steam Engine and All Presently Known Combustion Engines&quot; (1893). Endorsed by scientific opinion, including Lord Kelvin, he won the backing of Krupp and . He clung to the Carnot cycle as a symbol. But years of practical work failed to achieve an isothermal combustion engine, nor could have done, since it requires such an enormous quantity of air that it cannot develop enough power to compress it. Furthermore, controlled fuel injection turned out to be no easy matter.

Even so, the Diesel engine slowly evolved over 25 years to become a practical high-compression air engine, its fuel injected near the end of the compression stroke and ignited by the heat of compression, capable by 1969 of 40% efficiency.

== As a macroscopic construct ==
The Carnot heat engine is, ultimately, a theoretical construct based on an &quot;idealized&quot; thermodynamic system. On a practical human-scale level the Carnot cycle has proven a valuable model, as in advancing the development of the diesel engine. However, on a macroscopic scale limitations placed by the model&#x27;s assumptions prove it impractical, and, ultimately, incapable of doing any work. As such, per Carnot&#x27;s theorem, the Carnot engine may be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than any practical device that could ever be built.

For example, for the isothermal expansion part of the Carnot cycle, the following 
&quot;infinitesimal&quot; conditions must be satisfied simultaneously at every step in the expansion:

* The hot reservoir temperature &quot;TH&quot; is infinitesimally higher than the system gas temperature &quot;T&quot; so heat flow (energy transfer) from the hot reservoir to the gas is made without increasing &quot;T&quot; (via infinitesimal work on the surroundings by the gas as another energy transfer); if &quot;TH&quot; is significantly higher than &quot;T&quot;, then &quot;T&quot; may be not uniform through the gas so the system would deviate from thermal equilibrium as well as not being a reversible process (i.e. not a Carnot cycle) or &quot;T&quot; might increase noticeably so it would not be an isothermal process.
* The force externally applied on the piston (opposite to the internal force on the piston by the gas) needs to be infinitesimally reduced externally. Without this assistance, it would not be possible to follow a gas PV (Pressure-Volume) curve downward at a constant &quot;T&quot; since following this curve means that the gas-to-piston force decreases (&quot;P&quot; decreases) as the volume expands (the piston moves outward). If this assistance is so strong that the volume expansion is significant, the system may deviate from thermal equilibrium, and the process fail to be reversible (and thus not a Carnot cycle).

Such &quot;infinitesimal&quot; requirements as these (and others) cause the Carnot cycle to take an &quot;infinite amount of time&quot;, rendering the production of work impossible. 

Other practical requirements that make the Carnot cycle impractical to realize include fine control of the gas, and perfect thermal contact with the surroundings (including high and low temperature reservoirs).

<doc id="6121" wikidata="Q27611" url="?curid=6121" title="Central America">
<text>Central America is a subregion of North America. Its political boundaries are defined as bordering Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. Central America is usually defined as consisting of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from southern Mexico to southeastern Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage.

In the pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus&#x27; voyages to the Americas, Spain began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy Juan de O&#x27;Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which established New Spain&#x27;s independence from Spain. On 15 September 1821, the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America&#x27;s separation from the Spanish Empire and provide for the establishment of a new Central American state. Some of New Spain&#x27;s provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) were annexed to the First Mexican Empire; however in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America until 1838.

In 1838, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua became the first of Central America&#x27;s seven states to become independent countries, followed by El Salvador in 1841, Panama in 1903, and Belize in 1981. Despite the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America, countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua continue to maintain a Central American identity. Belizeans are usually identified as culturally Caribbean rather than Central American, while Panamanians identify themselves more broadly with their South American neighbors.

The Spanish-speaking countries officially include both North America and South America as a single continent, , which is split into four subregions: North America (Northern America and Mexico), Central America, South America, and Insular America (the West Indies).

== Different definitions ==
&quot;Central America&quot; may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:

* The non-official United Nations geoscheme for the Americas defines &quot;Central America&quot; as all states of mainland North America south of the United States, hence grouping Mexico as part of Central America for statistics purposes, but historically and politically Mexico is considered North American.
* Middle America is usually thought to comprise Mexico to the north of the 7 states of &quot;Central America&quot; as well as Colombia and Venezuela to the south. Usually, the whole of the Caribbean to the northeast, and sometimes the Guyanas, are also included. According to one source, the term &quot;Central America&quot; was used as a synonym for &quot;Middle America&quot; at least as recently as 1962.
* In Ibero-America (Spanish and Portuguese speaking American countries), the Americas are considered a single continent (America), and Central America is considered a subregion of the continent comprising the seven countries south of Mexico and north of Colombia. 
* For the people living in the five countries, formerly part of the Federal Republic of Central America there is a distinction between the Spanish language terms &quot;América Central&quot; and &quot;Centroamérica&quot;. While both can be translated into English as &quot;Central America&quot;, &quot;América Central&quot; is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between Mexico and Colombia, while &quot;Centroamérica&quot; is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region. 
* In Portuguese as a rule and occasionally in Spanish and other languages, the entirety of the Antilles is often included in the definition of Central America. Indeed, the Dominican Republic is a full member of the Central American Integration System.

== History ==

 Central America was formed more than 3 million years ago, as part of the Isthmus of Panama, when its portion of land connected each side of water.

In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.

Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado&#x27;s forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K&#x27;iche&#x27;, Tz&#x27;utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.

In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Audiencia Real de Guatemala&quot;. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.

The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the Intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.

From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.

The Federal Republic of Central America, initially known as the United Provinces of Central America, was a sovereign state that existed from 1823 to 1840. It was composed of five states: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The federation was established after these regions declared independence from Spain in 1821 and briefly joined the Mexican Empire before breaking away to form their own union. The republic adopted a constitution in 1824, which was inspired by the federal system of the United States. It provided for a federal capital, initially located in Guatemala City, and a president for each of the five constituent states. The constitution abolished slavery and maintained the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church, while restricting suffrage to the upper classes. 

The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence. Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.

Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed &quot;Audiencia Real de Panama&quot;. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.

By the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase banana republic.

After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict, and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice, and violence are still widespread. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere, after Haiti.

== Geography ==

Central America is a part of North America consisting of a tapering isthmus running from the southern extent of Mexico to the northwestern portion of South America. Central America has the Gulf of Mexico, a body of water within the Atlantic Ocean, to the north; the Caribbean Sea, also part of the Atlantic Ocean, to the northeast; and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America, while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Atrato River, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.

Central America has over 70 active volcanoes, 41 which are located in El Salvador, and Guatemala. The volcano with the most activity in Central America is Santa María. Still experiencing frequent eruptions to this day, with the last one beginning in 2013, and still is going on to this day.

Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At , Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:

Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.

Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.

=== Biodiversity ===
===Central American forests===

Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world&#x27;s biodiversity. The Pacific Flyway is a major north–south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropical realms. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity. The table below shows recent statistics:

Over 300 species of the region&#x27;s flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.

Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize&#x27;s land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize&#x27;s marine territory are also protected. A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species.
So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.

From 2001 to 2010, of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with . Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with , and a gain in the dry forest biome at . Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.

===Montane forests===
The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of , extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico&#x27;s Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.

Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, species of &quot;Weinmannia&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;, and &quot;Drimys granadensis&quot;. The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.

The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund. These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from , on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.

=== Fauna ===
===National birds===

Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (&quot;Pharomacrus mocinno&quot;), three-wattled bellbird (&quot;Procnias tricarunculata&quot;), bare-necked umbrellabird (&quot;Cephalopterus glabricollis&quot;), and black guan (&quot;Chamaepetes unicolor&quot;). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America. The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America&#x27;s tropical forest.

=== Geology ===


Central America is geologically very active, with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently, and tsunamis occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.

Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench. For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, January 2001, February 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.

The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.

Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.

Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.

Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

===Capital cities===

The population of Central America is estimated at as of . With an area of , it has a population density of . Human Development Index values are from the estimates for 2017.


=== Languages ===

The official language majority in all Central American countries is Spanish, except in Belize, where the official language is English. Mayan languages constitute a language family consisting of about 26 related languages. Guatemala formally recognized 21 of these in 1996. Xinca, Miskito, and Garifuna are also present in Central America.

=== Ethnic groups ===
This region of the continent is very rich in terms of ethnic groups. The majority of the population is mestizo, with sizable Mayan and African descendent populations present, along with numerous other indigenous groups such as the Miskito people. The immigration of Arabs, Jews, Chinese, Europeans and others brought additional groups to the area.

=== Religious groups ===
===Cathedrals===

The predominant religion in Central America is Christianity (95.6%). Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th century, Catholicism became the most popular religion in the region until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion.

== Politics ==
===Leaders===
=== Integration ===

Central America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the Central American Court of Justice.

In 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.

In 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System (&quot;Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana&quot;, or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the Dominican Republic, a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.

On 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations. No timeline for implementation was discussed.

Central America already has several supranational institutions such as the Central American Parliament, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common Market.

On 22 July 2011, President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador became the first president &quot;pro tempore&quot; to SICA. El Salvador also became the headquarters of SICA with the inauguration of a new building.

=== Foreign relations ===

Until recently, all Central American countries maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China. President Óscar Arias of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In August 2018, El Salvador also severed ties with Taiwan to formally start recognizing the People&#x27;s Republic of China as sole China, a move many considered lacked transparency due to its abruptness and reports of the Chinese government&#x27;s desires to invest in the department of La Union while also promising to fund the ruling party&#x27;s reelection campaign. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China. On 9 December 2021, Nicaragua resumed relations with the PRC.

=== Parliament ===
The Central American Parliament (aka PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.

Costa Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament&#x27;s decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.
== Economy ==



Signed in 2004, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade among its members.

Guatemala has the largest economy in the region. Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and cardamom. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports, 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.

The region is particularly attractive for companies (especially clothing companies) because of its geographical proximity to the United States, very low wages and considerable tax advantages. In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from El Salvador, 55 per cent from Guatemala, and 65 per cent from Honduras. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.

They are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of the &quot;maquilas&quot; sector of the audit firm Coverco, &quot;labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors.&quot; Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder. In some cases, business leaders have used the services of the maras. Finally, black lists containing the names of trade unionists or political activists are circulating in employers&#x27; circles.

Economic growth in Central America is projected to slow slightly in 2014–15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from stronger economic activity in the United States.

=== Tourism ===
===Coasts===

Tourism in Belize has grown considerably in more recent times, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country. The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Belize&#x27;s tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming almost one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2012. Belize is also the only country in Central America with English as its official language, making this country a comfortable destination for English-speaking tourists.

Costa Rica is the most visited nation in Central America. Tourism in Costa Rica is one of the fastest growing economic sectors of the country, having become the largest source of foreign revenue by 1995. Since 1999, tourism has earned more foreign exchange than bananas, pineapples and coffee exports combined. The tourism boom began in 1987, with the number of visitors up from 329,000 in 1988, through 1.03 million in 1999, to a historical record of 2.43 million foreign visitors and $1.92-billion in revenue in 2013. In 2012 tourism contributed with 12.5% of the country&#x27;s GDP and it was responsible for 11.7% of direct and indirect employment.

Tourism in Nicaragua has grown considerably recently, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country. The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Nicaragua&#x27;s tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2010.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===

The Inter-American Highway is the Central American section of the Pan-American Highway, and spans between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Panama City, Panama. Because of the break in the highway known as the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between Central America and South America in an automobile.

<doc id="6122" wikidata="Q170058" url="?curid=6122" title="Continuous function">
<text>In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a small variation of the argument induces a small variation of the value of the function. This implies there are no abrupt changes in value, known as &quot;discontinuities&quot;. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is . Until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon–delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.

Continuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.

A stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.

As an example, the function denoting the height of a growing flower at time would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time would be considered discontinuous since it &quot;jumps&quot; at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.

==History==

A form of the epsilon–delta definition of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of formula_1 as follows: an infinitely small increment formula_2 of the independent variable &quot;x&quot; always produces an infinitely small change formula_3 of the dependent variable &quot;y&quot; (see e.g. &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot;, p. 34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his definition of continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s, but the work wasn&#x27;t published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point &quot;c&quot; unless it was defined at and on both sides of &quot;c&quot;, but Édouard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of &quot;c&quot;, and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at &quot;c&quot;. All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use. Eduard Heine provided the first published definition of uniform continuity in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1854.

==Real functions==

===Definition===
A real function that is a function from real numbers to real numbers can be represented by a graph in the Cartesian plane; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken curve whose domain is the entire real line. A more mathematically rigorous definition is given below.

Continuity of real functions is usually defined in terms of limits. A function with variable is &quot;continuous at&quot; the real number , if the limit of formula_4 as tends to , is equal to formula_5

There are several different definitions of the (global) continuity of a function, which depend on the nature of its domain. 

A function is continuous on an open interval if the interval is contained in the function&#x27;s domain and the function is continuous at every interval point. A function that is continuous on the interval formula_6 (the whole real line) is often called simply a continuous function; one also says that such a function is &quot;continuous everywhere&quot;. For example, all polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.

A function is continuous on a semi-open or a closed interval; if the interval is contained in the domain of the function, the function is continuous at every interior point of the interval, and the value of the function at each endpoint that belongs to the interval is the limit of the values of the function when the variable tends to the endpoint from the interior of the interval. For example, the function formula_7 is continuous on its whole domain, which is the closed interval formula_8

Many commonly encountered functions are partial functions that have a domain formed by all real numbers, except some isolated points. Examples include the reciprocal function formula_9 and the tangent function formula_10 When they are continuous on their domain, one says, in some contexts, that they are continuous, although they are not continuous everywhere. In other contexts, mainly when one is interested in their behavior near the exceptional points, one says they are discontinuous.

A partial function is &quot;discontinuous&quot; at a point if the point belongs to the topological closure of its domain, and either the point does not belong to the domain of the function or the function is not continuous at the point. For example, the functions formula_11 and formula_12 are discontinuous at , and remain discontinuous whichever value is chosen for defining them at . A point where a function is discontinuous is called a &quot;discontinuity&quot;.

Using mathematical notation, several ways exist to define continuous functions in the three senses mentioned above.

Let formula_13 be a function defined on a subset formula_14 of the set formula_15 of real numbers.

This subset formula_14 is the domain of . Some possible choices include 
*formula_17: i.e., formula_18 is the whole set of real numbers. or, for and real numbers,
*formula_19: formula_18 is a closed interval, or
*formula_21: formula_18 is an open interval.

In the case of the domain formula_14 being defined as an open interval, formula_24 and formula_25 do not belong to formula_14, and the values of formula_27 and formula_28 do not matter for continuity on formula_14.

====Definition in terms of limits of functions====
The function is &quot;continuous at some point&quot; of its domain if the limit of formula_4 as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot; through the domain of &quot;f&quot;, exists and is equal to formula_5 In mathematical notation, this is written as
formula_32
In detail this means three conditions: first, has to be defined at (guaranteed by the requirement that is in the domain of ). Second, the limit of that equation has to exist. Third, the value of this limit must equal formula_5

(Here, we have assumed that the domain of &quot;f&quot; does not have any isolated points.)

====Definition in terms of neighborhoods====
A neighborhood of a point &quot;c&quot; is a set that contains, at least, all points within some fixed distance of &quot;c&quot;. Intuitively, a function is continuous at a point &quot;c&quot; if the range of &quot;f&quot; over the neighborhood of &quot;c&quot; shrinks to a single point formula_34 as the width of the neighborhood around &quot;c&quot; shrinks to zero. More precisely, a function &quot;f&quot; is continuous at a point &quot;c&quot; of its domain if, for any neighborhood formula_35 there is a neighborhood formula_36 in its domain such that formula_37 whenever formula_38

As neighborhoods are defined in any topological space, this definition of a continuous function applies not only for real functions but also when the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition. It follows that a function is automatically continuous at every isolated point of its domain. For example, every real-valued function on the integers is continuous.

====Definition in terms of limits of sequences====

One can instead require that for any sequence formula_39 of points in the domain which converges to &quot;c&quot;, the corresponding sequence formula_40 converges to formula_5 In mathematical notation, formula_42

====Weierstrass and Jordan definitions (epsilon–delta) of continuous functions====

Explicitly including the definition of the limit of a function, we obtain a self-contained definition: Given a function formula_43 as above and an element formula_44 of the domain formula_14, formula_46 is said to be continuous at the point formula_44 when the following holds: For any positive real number formula_48 however small, there exists some positive real number formula_49 such that for all formula_50 in the domain of formula_46 with formula_52 the value of formula_53 satisfies
formula_54

Alternatively written, continuity of formula_43 at formula_56 means that for every formula_48 there exists a formula_49 such that for all formula_59:
formula_60

More intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the formula_53 values to stay in some small neighborhood around formula_62 we need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the formula_50 values around formula_64 If we can do that no matter how small the formula_65 neighborhood is, then formula_46 is continuous at formula_64

In modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a basis for the topology, here the metric topology.

Weierstrass had required that the interval formula_68 be entirely within the domain formula_14, but Jordan removed that restriction.

====Definition in terms of control of the remainder====
In proofs and numerical analysis, we often need to know how fast limits are converging, or in other words, control of the remainder. We can formalize this to a definition of continuity. 
A function formula_70 is called a control function if
* &quot;C&quot; is non-decreasing
*formula_71

A function formula_72 is &quot;C&quot;-continuous at formula_44 if there exists such a neighbourhood formula_74 that 
formula_75

A function is continuous in formula_44 if it is &quot;C&quot;-continuous for some control function &quot;C&quot;.

This approach leads naturally to refining the notion of continuity by restricting the set of admissible control functions. For a given set of control functions formula_77 a function is if it is for some formula_78 For example, the Lipschitz and Hölder continuous functions of exponent below are defined by the set of control functions 
formula_79 
respectively 
formula_80

====Definition using oscillation====

Continuity can also be defined in terms of oscillation: a function &quot;f&quot; is continuous at a point formula_44 if and only if its oscillation at that point is zero; in symbols, formula_82 A benefit of this definition is that it discontinuity: the oscillation gives how the function is discontinuous at a point.

This definition is helpful in descriptive set theory to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than formula_83 (hence a formula_84 set) – and gives a rapid proof of one direction of the Lebesgue integrability condition.

The oscillation is equivalent to the formula_85 definition by a simple re-arrangement and by using a limit (lim sup, lim inf) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given formula_86 there is no formula_87 that satisfies the formula_85 definition, then the oscillation is at least formula_89 and conversely if for every formula_83 there is a desired formula_91 the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

====Definition using the hyperreals====
Cauchy defined the continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an infinitesimal change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse&quot;, page 34). Non-standard analysis is a way of making this mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by adding infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the hyperreal numbers. In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.

(see microcontinuity). In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable always produces an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to Augustin-Louis Cauchy&#x27;s definition of continuity.

===Construction of continuous functions===
Checking the continuity of a given function can be simplified by checking one of the above defining properties for the building blocks of the given function. It is straightforward to show that the sum of two functions, continuous on some domain, is also continuous on this domain. Given
formula_92
then the 
formula_93 
(defined by formula_94 for all formula_95) is continuous in formula_96

The same holds for the ,
formula_97
(defined by formula_98 for all formula_59)
is continuous in formula_96

Combining the above preservations of continuity and the continuity of constant functions and of the identity function formula_101 one arrives at the continuity of all polynomial functions such as
formula_102
(pictured on the right).

In the same way, it can be shown that the 
formula_103
(defined by formula_104 for all formula_59 such that formula_106)
is continuous in formula_107

This implies that, excluding the roots of formula_108 the 
formula_109
(defined by formula_110 for all formula_59, such that formula_112)
is also continuous on formula_113.

For example, the function (pictured)
formula_114
is defined for all real numbers formula_115 and is continuous at every such point. Thus, it is a continuous function. The question of continuity at formula_116 does not arise since formula_116 is not in the domain of formula_118 There is no continuous function formula_119 that agrees with formula_120 for all formula_121

Since the function sine is continuous on all reals, the sinc function formula_122 is defined and continuous for all real formula_123 However, unlike the previous example, &quot;G&quot; be extended to a continuous function on real numbers, by the value formula_124 to be 1, which is the limit of formula_125 when &quot;x&quot; approaches 0, i.e.,
formula_126

Thus, by setting
:formula_127

the sinc-function becomes a continuous function on all real numbers. The term is used in such cases when (re)defining values of a function to coincide with the appropriate limits make a function continuous at specific points.

A more involved construction of continuous functions is the function composition. Given two continuous functions
formula_128 
their composition, denoted as
formula_129 and defined by formula_130 is continuous.

This construction allows stating, for example, that
formula_131 
is continuous for all formula_132

===Examples of discontinuous functions===

An example of a discontinuous function is the Heaviside step function formula_133, defined by
formula_134

Pick for instance formula_135. Then there is no around formula_136, i.e. no open interval formula_137 with formula_138 that will force all the formula_139 values to be within the of formula_140, i.e. within formula_141. Intuitively, we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values.

Similarly, the signum or sign function
formula_142
is discontinuous at formula_136 but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function
formula_144
is continuous everywhere apart from formula_136.
Besides plausible continuities and discontinuities like above, there are also functions with a behavior, often coined pathological, for example, Thomae&#x27;s function,
formula_146
is continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. In a similar vein, Dirichlet&#x27;s function, the indicator function for the set of rational numbers,
formula_147
is nowhere continuous.

===Properties===

====A useful lemma====
Let formula_53 be a function that is continuous at a point formula_149 and formula_150 be a value such formula_151 Then formula_152 throughout some neighbourhood of formula_64

&quot;Proof:&quot; By the definition of continuity, take formula_154 , then there exists formula_155 such that 
formula_156
Suppose there is a point in the neighbourhood formula_157 for which formula_158 then we have the contradiction
formula_159

====Intermediate value theorem====
The intermediate value theorem is an existence theorem, based on the real number property of completeness, and states:

:If the real-valued function &quot;f&quot; is continuous on the closed interval formula_160 and &quot;k&quot; is some number between formula_27 and formula_162 then there is some number formula_163 such that formula_164

For example, if a child grows from 1 m to 1.5 m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child&#x27;s height must have been 1.25 m.

As a consequence, if &quot;f&quot; is continuous on formula_165 and formula_27 and formula_28 differ in sign, then, at some point formula_163 formula_34 must equal zero.

====Extreme value theorem====
The extreme value theorem states that if a function &quot;f&quot; is defined on a closed interval formula_165 (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists formula_171 with formula_172 for all formula_173 The same is true of the minimum of &quot;f&quot;. These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval formula_174 (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function formula_175 defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.

====Relation to differentiability and integrability====
Every differentiable function
formula_176
is continuous, as can be shown. The converse does not hold: for example, the absolute value function
:formula_177
is everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at formula_136 (but is so everywhere else). Weierstrass&#x27;s function is also everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.

The derivative &quot;f′&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of a differentiable function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) need not be continuous. If &quot;f′&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is continuous, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is said to be &quot;continuously differentiable&quot;. The set of such functions is denoted formula_179 More generally, the set of functions
formula_180
(from an open interval (or open subset of formula_15) formula_182 to the reals) such that &quot;f&quot; is formula_183 times differentiable and such that the formula_183-th derivative of &quot;f&quot; is continuous is denoted formula_185 See differentiability class. In the field of computer graphics, properties related (but not identical) to formula_186 are sometimes called formula_187 (continuity of position), formula_188 (continuity of tangency), and formula_189 (continuity of curvature); see Smoothness of curves and surfaces.

Every continuous function
formula_190
is integrable (for example in the sense of the Riemann integral). The converse does not hold, as the (integrable but discontinuous) sign function shows.

====Pointwise and uniform limits====

Given a sequence
formula_191
of functions such that the limit
formula_192
exists for all formula_193, the resulting function formula_53 is referred to as the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions formula_195 The pointwise limit function need not be continuous, even if all functions formula_196 are continuous, as the animation at the right shows. However, &quot;f&quot; is continuous if all functions formula_196 are continuous and the sequence converges uniformly, by the uniform convergence theorem. This theorem can be used to show that the exponential functions, logarithms, square root function, and trigonometric functions are continuous.

===Directional Continuity===
Discontinuous functions may be discontinuous in a restricted way, giving rise to the concept of directional continuity (or right and left continuous functions) and semi-continuity. Roughly speaking, a function is if no jump occurs when the limit point is approached from the right. Formally, &quot;f&quot; is said to be right-continuous at the point &quot;c&quot; if the following holds: For any number formula_198 however small, there exists some number formula_49 such that for all &quot;x&quot; in the domain with formula_200 the value of formula_53 will satisfy
formula_202

This is the same condition as continuous functions, except it is required to hold for &quot;x&quot; strictly larger than &quot;c&quot; only. Requiring it instead for all &quot;x&quot; with formula_203 yields the notion of functions. A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.

=== Semicontinuity===

A function &quot;f&quot; is if, roughly, any jumps that might occur only go down, but not up. That is, for any formula_48 there exists some number formula_49 such that for all &quot;x&quot; in the domain with formula_206 the value of formula_53 satisfies
formula_208
The reverse condition is .

==Continuous functions between metric spaces== 
The concept of continuous real-valued functions can be generalized to functions between metric spaces. A metric space is a set formula_209 equipped with a function (called metric) formula_210 that can be thought of as a measurement of the distance of any two elements in &quot;X&quot;. Formally, the metric is a function
formula_211
that satisfies a number of requirements, notably the triangle inequality. Given two metric spaces formula_212 and formula_213 and a function
formula_214
then formula_46 is continuous at the point formula_216 (with respect to the given metrics) if for any positive real number formula_48 there exists a positive real number formula_49 such that all formula_219 satisfying formula_220 will also satisfy formula_221 As in the case of real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence formula_222 in formula_209 with limit formula_224 we have formula_225 The latter condition can be weakened as follows: formula_46 is continuous at the point formula_227 if and only if for every convergent sequence formula_222 in formula_209 with limit formula_227, the sequence formula_231 is a Cauchy sequence, and formula_227 is in the domain of formula_46.

The set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a formula_84 set – this follows from the formula_85 definition of continuity.

This notion of continuity is applied, for example, in functional analysis. A key statement in this area says that a linear operator
formula_236
between normed vector spaces formula_237 and formula_238 (which are vector spaces equipped with a compatible norm, denoted formula_239) is continuous if and only if it is bounded, that is, there is a constant formula_240 such that
formula_241
for all formula_242

===Uniform, Hölder and Lipschitz continuity===

The concept of continuity for functions between metric spaces can be strengthened in various ways by limiting the way formula_87 depends on formula_83 and &quot;c&quot; in the definition above. Intuitively, a function &quot;f&quot; as above is uniformly continuous if the formula_87 does
not depend on the point &quot;c&quot;. More precisely, it is required that for every real number formula_198 there exists formula_49 such that for every formula_248 with formula_249 we have that formula_250 Thus, any uniformly continuous function is continuous. The converse does not generally hold but holds when the domain space &quot;X&quot; is compact. Uniformly continuous maps can be defined in the more general situation of uniform spaces.

A function is Hölder continuous with exponent α (a real number) if there is a constant &quot;K&quot; such that for all formula_251 the inequality
formula_252
holds. Any Hölder continuous function is uniformly continuous. The particular case formula_253 is referred to as Lipschitz continuity. That is, a function is Lipschitz continuous if there is a constant &quot;K&quot; such that the inequality
formula_254
holds for any formula_255 The Lipschitz condition occurs, for example, in the Picard–Lindelöf theorem concerning the solutions of ordinary differential equations.

==Continuous functions between topological spaces==
Another, more abstract, notion of continuity is the continuity of functions between topological spaces in which there generally is no formal notion of distance, as there is in the case of metric spaces. A topological space is a set &quot;X&quot; together with a topology on &quot;X&quot;, which is a set of subsets of &quot;X&quot; satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the open balls in metric spaces while still allowing one to talk about the neighborhoods of a given point. The elements of a topology are called open subsets of &quot;X&quot; (with respect to the topology).

A function
formula_214
between two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is continuous if for every open set formula_257 the inverse image
formula_258
is an open subset of &quot;X&quot;. That is, &quot;f&quot; is a function between the sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; (not on the elements of the topology formula_259), but the continuity of &quot;f&quot; depends on the topologies used on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

This is equivalent to the condition that the preimages of the closed sets (which are the complements of the open subsets) in &quot;Y&quot; are closed in &quot;X&quot;.

An extreme example: if a set &quot;X&quot; is given the discrete topology (in which every subset is open), all functions
formula_260
to any topological space &quot;T&quot; are continuous. On the other hand, if &quot;X&quot; is equipped with the indiscrete topology (in which the only open subsets are the empty set and &quot;X&quot;) and the space &quot;T&quot; set is at least T0, then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose codomain is indiscrete is continuous.

=== Continuity at a point ===

The translation in the language of neighborhoods of the formula_261-definition of continuity leads to the following definition of the continuity at a point:
This definition is equivalent to the same statement with neighborhoods restricted to open neighborhoods and can be restated in several ways by using preimages rather than images.

Also, as every set that contains a neighborhood is also a neighborhood, and formula_262 is the largest subset of such that formula_263 this definition may be simplified into:
As an open set is a set that is a neighborhood of all its points, a function formula_264 is continuous at every point of if and only if it is a continuous function.

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above formula_85 definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. In general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance. If, however, the target space is a Hausdorff space, it is still true that &quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;a&quot; if and only if the limit of &quot;f&quot; as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;a&quot; is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.

Given formula_266 a map formula_264 is continuous at formula_50 if and only if whenever formula_269 is a filter on formula_209 that converges to formula_50 in formula_272 which is expressed by writing formula_273 then necessarily formula_274 in formula_275 
If formula_276 denotes the neighborhood filter at formula_50 then formula_264 is continuous at formula_50 if and only if formula_280 in formula_275 Moreover, this happens if and only if the prefilter formula_282 is a filter base for the neighborhood filter of formula_53 in formula_275

=== Alternative definitions ===
Several equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist; thus, several equivalent ways exist to define a continuous function.

==== Sequences and nets ====
In several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points. This is often accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence. Still, for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set, known as nets. A function is (Heine-)continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences. In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.

In detail, a function formula_264 is sequentially continuous if whenever a sequence formula_222 in formula_209 converges to a limit formula_288 the sequence formula_231 converges to formula_290 Thus, sequentially continuous functions &quot;preserve sequential limits.&quot; Every continuous function is sequentially continuous. If formula_209 is a first-countable space and countable choice holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous. In particular, if formula_209 is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent. For non-first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces. Continuous functions preserve the limits of nets, and this property characterizes continuous functions.

For instance, consider the case of real-valued functions of one real variable:

&quot;Proof.&quot; Assume that formula_293 is continuous at formula_44 (in the sense of formula_295 continuity). Let formula_296 be a sequence converging at formula_44 (such a sequence always exists, for example, formula_298); since formula_46 is continuous at formula_44
formula_301
For any such formula_302 we can find a natural number formula_303 such that for all formula_304
formula_305
since formula_222 converges at formula_44; combining this with formula_308 we obtain
formula_309
Assume on the contrary that formula_46 is sequentially continuous and proceed by contradiction: suppose formula_46 is not continuous at formula_44
formula_313
then we can take formula_314 and call the corresponding point formula_315: in this way we have defined a sequence formula_316 such that
formula_317
by construction formula_318 but formula_319, which contradicts the hypothesis of sequential continuity. formula_320
==== Closure operator and interior operator definitions ====

In terms of the interior operator, a function formula_264 between topological spaces is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_322 
formula_323

In terms of the closure operator, formula_264 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_325 
formula_326
That is to say, given any element formula_219 that belongs to the closure of a subset formula_325 formula_53 necessarily belongs to the closure of formula_330 in formula_275 If we declare that a point formula_50 is a subset formula_333 if formula_334 then this terminology allows for a plain English description of continuity: formula_46 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_325 formula_46 maps points that are close to formula_338 to points that are close to formula_339 Similarly, formula_46 is continuous at a fixed given point formula_219 if and only if whenever formula_50 is close to a subset formula_325 then formula_53 is close to formula_339

Instead of specifying topological spaces by their open subsets, any topology on formula_209 can alternatively be determined by a closure operator or by an interior operator. 
Specifically, the map that sends a subset formula_338 of a topological space formula_209 to its topological closure formula_349 satisfies the Kuratowski closure axioms. Conversely, for any closure operator formula_350 there exists a unique topology formula_351 on formula_209 (specifically, formula_353) such that for every subset formula_325 formula_355 is equal to the topological closure formula_356 of formula_338 in formula_358 If the sets formula_209 and formula_360 are each associated with closure operators (both denoted by formula_361) then a map formula_264 is continuous if and only if formula_363 for every subset formula_364

Similarly, the map that sends a subset formula_338 of formula_209 to its topological interior formula_367 defines an interior operator. Conversely, any interior operator formula_368 induces a unique topology formula_351 on formula_209 (specifically, formula_371) such that for every formula_325 formula_373 is equal to the topological interior formula_374 of formula_338 in formula_358 If the sets formula_209 and formula_360 are each associated with interior operators (both denoted by formula_379) then a map formula_264 is continuous if and only if formula_381 for every subset formula_382

==== Filters and prefilters ====
Continuity can also be characterized in terms of filters. A function formula_264 is continuous if and only if whenever a filter formula_269 on formula_209 converges in formula_209 to a point formula_266 then the prefilter formula_388 converges in formula_360 to formula_290 This characterization remains true if the word &quot;filter&quot; is replaced by &quot;prefilter.&quot;

===Properties===
If formula_264 and formula_392 are continuous, then so is the composition formula_393 If formula_264 is continuous and
* &quot;X&quot; is compact, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is compact.
* &quot;X&quot; is connected, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is connected.
* &quot;X&quot; is path-connected, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is path-connected.
* &quot;X&quot; is Lindelöf, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is Lindelöf.
* &quot;X&quot; is separable, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is separable.

The possible topologies on a fixed set &quot;X&quot; are partially ordered: a topology formula_395 is said to be coarser than another topology formula_396 (notation: formula_397) if every open subset with respect to formula_395 is also open with respect to formula_399 Then, the identity map
formula_400
is continuous if and only if formula_397 (see also comparison of topologies). More generally, a continuous function
formula_402
stays continuous if the topology formula_403 is replaced by a coarser topology and/or formula_404 is replaced by a finer topology.

===Homeomorphisms===
Symmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an open map, for which of open sets are open. If an open map &quot;f&quot; has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map &quot;g&quot; has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a bijective function &quot;f&quot; between two topological spaces, the inverse function formula_405 need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a .

If a continuous bijection has as its domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.

===Defining topologies via continuous functions===
Given a function
formula_406
where &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and &quot;S&quot; is a set (without a specified topology), the final topology on &quot;S&quot; is defined by letting the open sets of &quot;S&quot; be those subsets &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; for which formula_407 is open in &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; has an existing topology, &quot;f&quot; is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is coarser than the final topology on &quot;S&quot;. Thus, the final topology is the finest topology on &quot;S&quot; that makes &quot;f&quot; continuous. If &quot;f&quot; is surjective, this topology is canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined by &quot;f&quot;.

Dually, for a function &quot;f&quot; from a set &quot;S&quot; to a topological space &quot;X&quot;, the initial topology on &quot;S&quot; is defined by designating as an open set every subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; such that formula_408 for some open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; has an existing topology, &quot;f&quot; is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on &quot;S&quot;. Thus, the initial topology is the coarsest topology on &quot;S&quot; that makes &quot;f&quot; continuous. If &quot;f&quot; is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the subspace topology of &quot;S&quot;, viewed as a subset of &quot;X&quot;.

A topology on a set &quot;S&quot; is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions formula_409 into all topological spaces &quot;X&quot;. Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps formula_410

==Related notions==

If formula_411 is a continuous function from some subset formula_412 of a topological space formula_209 then a of formula_46 to formula_209 is any continuous function formula_416 such that formula_417 for every formula_418 which is a condition that often written as formula_419 In words, it is any continuous function formula_416 that restricts to formula_46 on formula_422 This notion is used, for example, in the Tietze extension theorem and the Hahn–Banach theorem. If formula_411 is not continuous, then it could not possibly have a continuous extension. If formula_360 is a Hausdorff space and formula_412 is a dense subset of formula_209 then a continuous extension of formula_411 to formula_272 if one exists, will be unique. The Blumberg theorem states that if formula_429 is an arbitrary function then there exists a dense subset formula_14 of formula_15 such that the restriction formula_432 is continuous; in other words, every function formula_433 can be restricted to some dense subset on which it is continuous. 

Various other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function formula_264 between particular types of partially ordered sets formula_209 and formula_360 is continuous if for each directed subset formula_338 of formula_272 we have formula_439 Here formula_440 is the supremum with respect to the orderings in formula_209 and formula_442 respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the Scott topology.

In category theory, a functor
formula_443
between two categories is called if it commutes with small limits. That is to say,
formula_444
for any small (that is, indexed by a set formula_445 as opposed to a class) diagram of objects in formula_446.

A is a generalization of metric spaces and posets, which uses the concept of quantales, and that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and domains.

In measure theory, a function formula_447 defined on a Lebesgue measurable set formula_448 is called approximately continuous at a point formula_449 if the approximate limit of formula_46 at formula_44 exists and equals formula_65. This generalizes the notion of continuity by replacing the ordinary limit with the approximate limit. A fundamental result known as the Stepanov-Denjoy theorem states that a function is measurable if and only if it is approximately continuous almost everywhere.

<text>In vector calculus, the curl, also known as rotor, is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation. The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field.

A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes&#x27; theorem, which relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary curve.

The notation is more common in North America. In the rest of the world, particularly in 20th century scientific literature, the alternative notation is traditionally used, which comes from the &quot;rate of rotation&quot; that it represents. To avoid confusion, modern authors tend to use the cross product notation with the del (nabla) operator, as in which also reveals the relation between curl (rotor), divergence, and gradient operators.

Unlike the gradient and divergence, curl as formulated in vector calculus does not generalize simply to other dimensions; some generalizations are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This deficiency is a direct consequence of the limitations of vector calculus; on the other hand, when expressed as an antisymmetric tensor field via the wedge operator of geometric calculus, the curl generalizes to all dimensions. The circumstance is similar to that attending the 3-dimensional cross product, and indeed the connection is reflected in the notation formula_1 for the curl. 

The name &quot;curl&quot; was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 but the concept was apparently first used in the construction of an optical field theory by James MacCullagh in 1839.

==Definition==
}}

&lt;/math&gt; and the fingers curl along the orientation of 
| align = 
| direction = 
| alt1 = 
| header = Right-hand rule


The curl of a vector field , denoted by , or formula_2, or , is an operator that maps functions in to functions in , and in particular, it maps continuously differentiable functions to continuous functions . It can be defined in several ways, to be mentioned below:

One way to define the curl of a vector field at a point is implicitly through its components along various axes passing through the point: if formula_3 is any unit vector, the component of the curl of along the direction formula_3 may be defined to be the limiting value of a closed line integral in a plane perpendicular to formula_3 divided by the area enclosed, as the path of integration is contracted indefinitely around the point.

More specifically, the curl is defined at a point as
formula_6
where the line integral is calculated along the boundary of the area containing point p, being the magnitude of the area. This equation defines the component of the curl of along the direction formula_3. The infinitesimal surfaces bounded by have formula_3 as their normal. is oriented via the right-hand rule.

The above formula means that the component of the curl of a vector field along a certain axis is the &quot;infinitesimal area density&quot; of the circulation of the field in a plane perpendicular to that axis. This formula does not &quot;a priori&quot; define a legitimate vector field, for the individual circulation densities with respect to various axes &quot;a priori&quot; need not relate to each other in the same way as the components of a vector do; that they &quot;do&quot; indeed relate to each other in this precise manner must be proven separately.

To this definition fits naturally the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, as a global formula corresponding to the definition. It equates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the above line integral taken around the boundary of the surface.

Another way one can define the curl vector of a function at a point is explicitly as the limiting value of a vector-valued surface integral around a shell enclosing divided by the volume enclosed, as the shell is contracted indefinitely around .

More specifically, the curl may be defined by the vector formula
formula_9
where the surface integral is calculated along the boundary of the volume , being the magnitude of the volume, and formula_10 pointing outward from the surface perpendicularly at every point in .

In this formula, the cross product in the integrand measures the tangential component of at each point on the surface , and points along the surface at right angles to the &quot;tangential projection&quot; of . Integrating this cross product over the whole surface results in a vector whose magnitude measures the overall circulation of around , and whose direction is at right angles to this circulation. The above formula says that the &quot;curl&quot; of a vector field at a point is the &quot;infinitesimal volume density&quot; of this &quot;circulation vector&quot; around the point.

To this definition fits naturally another global formula (similar to the Kelvin-Stokes theorem) which equates the volume integral of the curl of a vector field to the above surface integral taken over the boundary of the volume. 

Whereas the above two definitions of the curl are coordinate free, there is another &quot;easy to memorize&quot; definition of the curl in curvilinear orthogonal coordinates, e.g. in Cartesian coordinates, spherical, cylindrical, or even elliptical or parabolic coordinates: formula_11

The equation for each component can be obtained by exchanging each occurrence of a subscript 1, 2, 3 in cyclic permutation: 1 → 2, 2 → 3, and 3 → 1 (where the subscripts represent the relevant indices).

If are the Cartesian coordinates and are the orthogonal coordinates, then 
formula_12 
is the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to . The remaining two components of curl result from cyclic permutation of indices: 3,1,2 → 1,2,3 → 2,3,1.

== Usage ==
In practice, the two coordinate-free definitions described above are rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl operator can be applied using some set of curvilinear coordinates, for which simpler representations have been derived.

The notation formula_13 has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional cross product, and it is useful as a mnemonic in Cartesian coordinates if formula_14 is taken as a vector differential operator del. Such notation involving operators is common in physics and algebra.

Expanded in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (see &quot;Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates&quot; for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations), formula_13 is, for formula_16 composed of formula_17 (where the subscripts indicate the components of the vector, not partial derivatives):
formula_18
where , , and are the unit vectors for the -, -, and -axes, respectively. This expands as follows:
formula_19

Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.

In a general coordinate system, the curl is given by
formula_20
where denotes the Levi-Civita tensor, the covariant derivative, formula_21 is the determinant of the metric tensor and the Einstein summation convention implies that repeated indices are summed over. Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols participating in the covariant derivative, this expression reduces to the partial derivative:
formula_22
where are the local basis vectors. Equivalently, using the exterior derivative, the curl can be expressed as:
formula_23

Here and are the musical isomorphisms, and is the Hodge star operator. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any oriented three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a chiral operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.

==Examples==

=== Example 1 ===
Suppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow (such as a large tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the center of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the center of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.
The curl of the vector field at any point is given by the rotation of an infinitesimal area in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane (for &quot;z&quot;-axis component of the curl), &quot;zx&quot;-plane (for &quot;y&quot;-axis component of the curl) and &quot;yz&quot;-plane (for &quot;x&quot;-axis component of the curl vector). This can be seen in the examples below.

=== Example 2 ===
The vector field
formula_24
can be decomposed as
formula_25

Upon visual inspection, the field can be described as &quot;rotating&quot;. If the vectors of the field were to represent a linear force acting on objects present at that point, and an object were to be placed inside the field, the object would start to rotate clockwise around itself. This is true regardless of where the object is placed.

Calculating the curl:
formula_26

The resulting vector field describing the curl would at all points be pointing in the negative direction. The results of this equation align with what could have been predicted using the right-hand rule using a right-handed coordinate system. Being a uniform vector field, the object described before would have the same rotational intensity regardless of where it was placed.
=== Example 3 ===
For the vector field
formula_27

the curl is not as obvious from the graph. However, taking the object in the previous example, and placing it anywhere on the line , the force exerted on the right side would be slightly greater than the force exerted on the left, causing it to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, it can be predicted that the resulting curl would be straight in the negative direction. Inversely, if placed on , the object would rotate counterclockwise and the right-hand rule would result in a positive direction.

Calculating the curl:
formula_28

The curl points in the negative direction when is positive and vice versa. In this field, the intensity of rotation would be greater as the object moves away from the plane .

===Further examples===
* In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk in uniform circular motion, the curl has the same value at all points, and this value turns out to be exactly two times the vectorial angular velocity of the disk (oriented as usual by the right-hand rule). More generally, for any flowing mass, the linear velocity vector field at each point of the mass flow has a curl (the vorticity of the flow at that point) equal to exactly two times the &quot;local&quot; vectorial angular velocity of the mass about the point.
* For any solid object subject to an external physical force (such as gravity or the electromagnetic force), one may consider the vector field representing the infinitesimal force-per-unit-volume contributions acting at each of the points of the object. This force field may create a net &quot;torque&quot; on the object about its center of mass, and this torque turns out to be directly proportional and vectorially parallel to the (vector-valued) integral of the &quot;curl&quot; of the force field over the whole volume.
* Of the four Maxwell&#x27;s equations, two—Faraday&#x27;s law and Ampère&#x27;s law—can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday&#x27;s law states that the curl of an electric field is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère&#x27;s law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and the time rate of change of the electric field.

== Identities ==
In general curvilinear coordinates (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields and can be shown to be
formula_29

Interchanging the vector field and operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:
formula_30
where is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field (i.e., in this case, is treated as being constant in space).

Another example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates
formula_31
and this identity defines the vector Laplacian of , symbolized as .

The curl of the gradient of &quot;any&quot; scalar field is always the zero vector field
formula_32
which follows from the antisymmetry in the definition of the curl, and the symmetry of second derivatives.

The divergence of the curl of any vector field is equal to zero: 
formula_33

If is a scalar valued function and is a vector field, then
formula_34

== Generalizations ==
The vector calculus operations of grad, curl, and div are most easily generalized in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In short, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying bivectors (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the special orthogonal Lie algebra formula_35 of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3 × 3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and these all being 3-dimensional spaces.

=== Differential forms ===
In 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is a real-valued function formula_36; a differential 1-form is the following expression, where the coefficients are functions:
formula_37
a differential 2-form is the formal sum, again with function coefficients:
formula_38
and a differential 3-form is defined by a single term with one function as coefficient:
formula_39
(Here the -coefficients are real functions of three variables; the &quot;wedge products&quot;, e.g. formula_40, can be interpreted as some kind of oriented area elements, formula_41, etc.)

The exterior derivative of a -form in is defined as the -form from above—and in if, e.g.,
formula_42
then the exterior derivative leads to
formula_43

The exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, 
formula_44
and antisymmetry,
formula_45

the twofold application of the exterior derivative yields formula_46 (the zero formula_47-form).

Thus, denoting the space of -forms by formula_48 and the exterior derivative by one gets a sequence:
formula_49

Here formula_50 is the space of sections of the exterior algebra formula_51 vector bundle over R&quot;n&quot;, whose dimension is the binomial coefficient formula_52; note that formula_53 for formula_54 or formula_55. Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle:

formula_56

the 1-dimensional fibers correspond to scalar fields, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.

Differential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold, -forms can be identified with -vector fields (-forms are -covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an &quot;oriented&quot; vector space with a nondegenerate form (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between -vectors and -vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange -forms, -vector fields, -forms, and -vector fields; this is known as Hodge duality. Concretely, on this is given by:
* 1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form corresponds to the vector field .
* 1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces by the dual quantity (i.e., omit ), and likewise, taking care of orientation: corresponds to , and corresponds to . Thus the form corresponds to the &quot;dual form&quot; .

Thus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:
* grad takes a scalar field (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);
* curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a pseudovector field (2-form);
* div takes a pseudovector field (2-form) to a pseudoscalar field (3-form)

On the other hand, the fact that corresponds to the identities
formula_57
for any scalar field , and
formula_58
for any vector field .

Grad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and -forms at each point are always 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar fields, while the spaces of 1-forms and -forms are always fiberwise -dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.

Curl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are

so the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a &quot;2-vector field&quot;, which at each point belongs to 6-dimensional vector space, and so one has
formula_59
which yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.

However, one can define a curl of a vector field as a &quot;2-vector field&quot; in general, as described below.

=== Curl geometrically ===
2-vectors correspond to the exterior power ; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the special orthogonal Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations. This has dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) we have , which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar – an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra 

The curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say and ) is simply a vertical vector field (in the direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.

Considering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.

==Inverse==

In the case where the divergence of a vector field is zero, a vector field exists such that . This is why the magnetic field, characterized by zero divergence, can be expressed as the curl of a magnetic vector potential.

If is a vector field with , then adding any gradient vector field to will result in another vector field such that as well. This can be summarized by saying that the inverse curl of a three-dimensional vector field can be obtained up to an unknown irrotational field with the Biot–Savart law.
