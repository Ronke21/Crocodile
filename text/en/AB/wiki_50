<text>David Hume (; born David Home; – 25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist who was best known for his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical scepticism and metaphysical naturalism. Beginning with &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1739–40), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as an empiricist.

Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit. We never actually perceive that one event causes another but only experience the &quot;constant conjunction&quot; of events. This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past; this metaphysical presupposition cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.

An opponent of philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming that &quot;Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.&quot; Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle. He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena and is usually accepted by historians of European philosophy to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what &quot;ought&quot; to be done.

Hume denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of perceptions connected by an association of ideas. Hume&#x27;s compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. His philosophy of religion, including his rejection of miracles, and critique of the argument from design for God&#x27;s existence, were especially controversial for their time. Hume left a legacy that affected utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and many other fields and thinkers. Immanuel Kant credited Hume as the inspiration that had awakened him from his &quot;dogmatic slumbers.&quot;

== Early life ==
Hume was born on 26 April 1711, as David Home, in a tenement on the north side of Edinburgh&#x27;s Lawnmarket. He was the second of two sons born to Catherine Home (née Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer of Newton, Midlothian and his wife Mary Falconer (née Norvell), and Joseph Home of Chirnside in the County of Berwick, an advocate of Ninewells. Joseph died just after David&#x27;s second birthday. Catherine, who never remarried, raised the two brothers and their sister on her own.

Hume changed his family name&#x27;s spelling in 1734, as the surname &#x27;Home&#x27; (pronounced as &#x27;Hume&#x27;) was not well-known in England. Hume never married and lived partly at his Chirnside family home in Berwickshire, which had belonged to the family since the 16th century. His finances as a young man were very &quot;slender&quot;, as his family was not rich; as a younger son he had little to live on.

Hume attended the University of Edinburgh at an unusually early ageeither 12 or possibly as young as 10at a time when 14 was the typical age. Initially, Hume considered a career in law, because of his family. However, in his words, he came to have:

...an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring.

He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that &quot;there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books&quot;. He did not graduate.

=== &quot;Disease of the learned&quot; ===
At around age 18, Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him &quot;a new Scene of Thought&quot;, inspiring him &quot;to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it&quot;. As he did not recount what this scene exactly was, commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One prominent interpretation among contemporary Humean scholarship is that this new &quot;scene of thought&quot; was Hume&#x27;s realisation that Francis Hutcheson&#x27;s theory of &quot;moral sense&quot; could be applied to the understanding of morality as well.

From this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, first starting with a coldnesswhich he attributed to a &quot;Laziness of Temper&quot;that lasted about nine months. Scurvy spots later broke out on his fingers, persuading Hume&#x27;s physician to diagnose him with the &quot;Disease of the Learned&quot;.

Hume wrote that he &quot;went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills&quot;, taken along with a pint of claret every day. He also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations. After eating well for a time, he went from being &quot;tall, lean and raw-bon&#x27;d&quot; to being &quot;sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like.&quot; Indeed, Hume would become well known for being obese and having a fondness for good port and cheese, often using them as philosophical metaphors for his conjectures.

== Career ==
Despite having noble ancestry, Hume had no source of income and no learned profession by age 25. As was common at his time, he became a merchant&#x27;s assistant, despite having to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via Bristol to La Flèche in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the Jesuits of the College of La Flèche.

Hume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his alleged &quot;atheism&quot;, also lamenting that his literary debut, &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, &quot;fell dead-born from the press.&quot; However, he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the University of Edinburgh. These successes provided him much needed income at the time. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, resulted in Hume&#x27;s writing the massive six-volume &quot;The History of England&quot;, which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. For over 60 years, Hume was the dominant interpreter of English history. He described his &quot;love for literary fame&quot; as his &quot;ruling passion&quot; and judged his two late works, the so-called &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; enquiries, &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&quot;, as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements. He would ask of his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than on the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as juvenilia: &quot;A work which the Author had projected before he left College.&quot; Despite Hume&#x27;s protestations, a consensus exists today that his most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the &quot;Treatise&quot;. Though he was only 23 years old when starting this work, it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of Western philosophy.

=== 1730s ===
Hume worked for four years on his first major work, &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, subtitled &quot;Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects&quot;, completing it in 1738 at age 28. Although many scholars today consider the &quot;Treatise&quot; to be Hume&#x27;s most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, critics in Great Britain at the time described it as &quot;abstract and unintelligible&quot;. As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years, he resolved &quot;to make a very rigid frugality supply [his] deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired [his] independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of [his] talents in literature&quot;.

Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote: &quot;Being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.&quot; There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the &quot;An Abstract of a Book lately Published&quot; as a summary of the main doctrines of the &quot;Treatise&quot;, without revealing its authorship. This work contained the same ideas, but with a shorter and clearer explanation. Although there has been some academic speculation as to the pamphlet&#x27;s true author, it is generally regarded as Hume&#x27;s creation.

=== 1740s ===
After the publication of &quot;Essays Moral and Political&quot; in 1741included in the later edition as &quot;Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary&quot;Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to William Cleghorn after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an atheist.

In 1745, during the Jacobite risings, Hume tutored the Marquess of Annandale, an engagement that ended in disarray after about a year. The Marquess could not follow with Hume&#x27;s lectures, his father saw little need for philosophy, and on a personal level, the Marquess found Hume&#x27;s dietary tendencies to be bizarre. Hume then started his great historical work, &quot;The History of England&quot;, which took fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time, he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend John Home, a preacher.

In this context, he associated with Lord Monboddo and other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General James St Clair, who was envoy to the courts of Turin and Vienna. At that time Hume wrote &quot;Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, later published as &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. Often called the &quot;First Enquiry&quot;, it proved little more successful than the &quot;Treatise&quot;, perhaps because of the publication of his short autobiography &quot;My Own Life&quot;, which &quot;made friends difficult for the first Enquiry&quot;. By the end of this period Hume had attained his well-known corpulent stature; &quot;the good table of the General and the prolonged inactive life had done their work&quot;, leaving him &quot;a man of tremendous bulk&quot;.

In 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside, although he continued to associate with the aforementioned Scottish Enlightenment figures.

=== 1750s–1760s ===
Hume&#x27;s religious views were often suspect and, in the 1750s, it was necessary for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of heresy, specifically in an ecclesiastical court. However, he &quot;would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church&quot;. Hume failed to gain the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow due to his religious views. By this time, he had published the &quot;Philosophical Essays&quot;, which were decidedly anti-religious. This represented a turning point in his career and the various opportunities made available to him. Even Adam Smith, his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern that public opinion would be against it. In 1761, all his works were banned on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.

Hume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year, the Faculty of Advocates hired him to be their Librarian, a job in which he would receive little to no pay, but which nonetheless gave him &quot;the command of a large library&quot;. This resource enabled him to continue historical research for &quot;The History of England&quot;. Hume&#x27;s volume of &quot;Political Discourses&quot;, written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; Donaldson in 1752, was the only work he considered successful on first publication.

In 1753, Hume moved from his house on Riddles Court on the Lawnmarket to a house on the Canongate at the other end of the Royal Mile. Here he lived in a tenement known as Jack&#x27;s Land, immediately west of the still surviving Shoemakers Land.

Eventually, with the publication of his six-volume &quot;The History of England&quot; between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted. The volumes traced events from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688 and was a bestseller in its day. Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller Andrew Millar, who sold Hume&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men&#x27;s interest in the success of the &quot;History&quot;. In 1762 Hume moved from Jack&#x27;s Land on the Canongate to James Court on the Lawnmarket. He sold the house to James Boswell in 1766.

== Later life ==

From 1763 to 1765, Hume was invited to attend Lord Hertford in Paris, where he became secretary to the British embassy in France. Hume was well received among Parisian society, and while there he met with Isaac de Pinto. In 1765, Hume served as a chargé d&#x27;affaires in Paris, writing &quot;despatches to the British Secretary of State&quot;. He wrote of his Paris life, &quot;I really wish often for the plain roughness of The Poker Club of Edinburgh... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness.&quot; Upon returning to Britain in 1766, Hume wrote a letter to Lord Hertford after being asked to by George Colebrooke; the letter informed Lord Hertford that he had an opportunity to invest in one of Colebrooke&#x27;s slave plantations in the West Indies, though Hertford ultimately decided not to do so. In June of that year, Hume facilitated the purchase of a slave plantation in Martinique on behalf of his friend, the wine merchant John Stewart, by writing to the colony&#x27;s governor Victor-Thérèse Charpentier.

According to Felix Waldmann, a former Hume Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, Hume&#x27;s &quot;puckish scepticism about the existence of religious miracles played a significant part in defining the critical outlook which underpins the practice of modern science.&quot; Waldmann also argued that Hume&#x27;s views &quot;served to reinforce the institution of racialised slavery in the later 18th century.&quot; In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany Jean-Jacques Rousseau to England. Once there, he and Rousseau fell out, leaving Hume sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau that he would author an account of the dispute, titling it &quot;A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau&quot;.

In 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here, he wrote that he was given &quot;all the secrets of the Kingdom&quot;. In 1769 he returned to James&#x27; Court in Edinburgh, where he would live from 1771 until his death in 1776. Hume&#x27;s nephew and namesake, David Hume of Ninewells (1757–1838), was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. He was a Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University and rose to be Principal Clerk of Session in the Scottish High Court and Baron of the Exchequer. He is buried with his uncle in Old Calton Cemetery.

=== Autobiography ===
In the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled &quot;My Own Life&quot;, summing up his entire life in &quot;fewer than 5 pages&quot;; it contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. Donald Seibert (1984), a scholar of 18th-century literature, judged it a &quot;remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere.&quot;

Despite condemning vanity as a dangerous passion, in his autobiography Hume confesses his belief that the &quot;love of literary fame&quot; had served as his &quot;ruling passion&quot; in life, and claims that this desire &quot;never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments&quot;. One such disappointment Hume discusses in this account is in the initial literary reception of the &quot;Treatise&quot;, which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the &quot;Essays&quot;: &quot;the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment&quot;. Hume, in his own retrospective judgment, argues that his philosophical debut&#x27;s apparent failure &quot;had proceeded more from the manner than the matter&quot;. He thus suggests that &quot;I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early.&quot;

Hume also provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: that &quot;my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.&quot; He also wrote of his social relations: &quot;My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary&quot;, noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as to the state, that &quot;though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury&quot;. He goes on to profess of his character: &quot;My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct.&quot; Hume concludes the essay with a frank admission:

I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.

=== Death ===
Diarist and biographer James Boswell saw Hume a few weeks before his death from a form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him that he sincerely believed it a &quot;most unreasonable fancy&quot; that there might be life after death. Hume asked that his body be interred in a &quot;simple Roman tomb&quot;, requesting in his will that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, &quot;leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest&quot;.

David Hume died at the southwest corner of St. Andrew&#x27;s Square in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, at what is now 21 Saint David Street. A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence and with the help of coincidence, suggests that the street was named after Hume.

His tomb stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of Calton Hill, in the Old Calton Cemetery. Adam Smith later recounted Hume&#x27;s amusing speculation that he might ask Charon, Hades&#x27; ferryman, to allow him a few more years of life in order to see &quot;the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition&quot;. The ferryman replied, &quot;You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years.… Get into the boat this instant.&quot;

== Writings ==
&quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; begins with the introduction: &quot;&#x27;Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature.… Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man.&quot; The science of man, as Hume explains, is the &quot;only solid foundation for the other sciences&quot; and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument. In regards to this, philosophical historian Frederick Copleston (1999) suggests that it was Hume&#x27;s aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply natural philosophy), and that &quot;Hume&#x27;s plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of Newtonian physics.&quot;

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of logical positivism, a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists (in summary of their verification principle), unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e., either tautological or contradictory), then it was meaningless. Hume, on this view, was a protopositivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate the ways in which ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are semantically equivalent to propositions about one&#x27;s experiences.

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume&#x27;s empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.

=== Impressions and ideas ===

A central doctrine of Hume&#x27;s philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, is that the mind consists of perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: &quot;All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call and .&quot; Hume believed that it would &quot;not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction&quot;, which commentators have generally taken to mean the distinction between &quot;feeling&quot; and &quot;thinking&quot;. Controversially, Hume, in some sense, may regard the distinction as a matter of degree, as he takes &quot;impressions&quot; to be distinguished from ideas on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacitywhat Henry E. Allison (2008) calls the &quot;FLV criterion.&quot; &quot;Ideas&quot; are therefore &quot;faint&quot; impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching a hot pan&#x27;s handle is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan. According to Hume, &quot;impressions&quot; are meant to be the original form of all our ideas. From this, Don Garrett (2002) has coined the term &quot;copy principle,&quot; referring to Hume&#x27;s doctrine that all ideas are ultimately copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.

==== Simple and complex ====
After establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;: &quot;simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation&quot;, whereas &quot;the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts&quot;. When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of colour-sensationswhat Hume notes as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensationagain, a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thus referred to as simple.

==== Principles of association ====
Regardless of how boundless it may seem; a person&#x27;s imagination is confined to the mind&#x27;s ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body&#x27;s sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, &quot;as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect&quot;:
* The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, someone looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive an idea of the physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the physical object&#x27;s idea.
* The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of a crayon in a box leads one to think of the crayon contiguous to it.
* The principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of a ball that had caused the window to shatter.

Hume elaborates more on the last principle, explaining that, when somebody observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, that results in &quot;an expectation that a particular event (a &#x27;cause&#x27;) will be followed by another event (an &#x27;effect&#x27;) previously and constantly associated with it&quot;. Hume calls this principle &quot;custom&quot;, or &quot;habit&quot;, saying that &quot;custom...renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past&quot;. However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words:
Experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way. 

Continuing this idea, Hume argues that &quot;only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely…be applied—all other sciences are reduced to probability&quot;. He uses this scepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.

=== Induction and causation ===
The cornerstone of Hume&#x27;s epistemology is the problem of induction. This may be the area of Hume&#x27;s thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go &quot;beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory&quot;. Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume&#x27;s argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is &quot;consistent and conceivable&quot; that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume&#x27;s solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that &quot;Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin&#x27;d us to judge as well as to breathe and feel.&quot; In 1985, and in agreement with Hume, John D. Kenyon writes:

Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment ... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.

Others, such as Charles Sanders Peirce, have demurred from Hume&#x27;s solution, while some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, have thought that Hume&#x27;s analysis has &quot;posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims&quot;.

The notion of causation is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. At least three interpretations of Hume&#x27;s theory of causation are represented in the literature:

# the logical positivist;
# the sceptical realist; and
# the quasi-realist.

Hume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, and humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by prior events or are independent instances. He opposed the widely accepted theory of causation that &#x27;all events have a specific course or reason&#x27;. Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, formed through his empiricist and sceptic beliefs. He split causation into two realms: &quot;All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact.&quot; Relations of Ideas are &quot;a priori&quot; and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed &quot;causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience&quot;. He goes on to say that, even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume&#x27;s separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as &quot;Hume&#x27;s fork.&quot;

Hume explains his theory of causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas and compares and contrasts his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief. In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors&#x27; theories of causation. Next, he uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have had while observing the Critical Phase. &quot;Habit or Custom&quot; mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realising it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It &quot;makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past&quot;. However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads him to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future is based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and that the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.

The logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as &quot;A causes B&quot;, in terms of regularities in perception: &quot;A causes B&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow&quot;, where &quot;whenever&quot; refers to all possible perceptions. In his &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, Hume wrote:

Power and necessity…are…qualities of perceptions, not of objects…felt by the soul and not perceiv&#x27;d externally in bodies.

This view is rejected by sceptical realists, who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events. Hume said that, when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:

Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means…there is a &quot;necessary connexion&quot; to be taken into consideration.

Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, &quot;there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection&quot; and &quot;we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects&quot;. However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing: &quot;I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause.&quot;

It has been argued that, while Hume did not think that causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully-fledged realist either. Simon Blackburn calls this a quasi-realist reading, saying that &quot;Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.&quot; In Hume&#x27;s words, &quot;nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion&quot;.

=== &#x27;Self&#x27; ===
Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured the bundle theory of personal identity. In this theory, &quot;the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply &#x27;a bundle of perceptions&#x27; without unity or cohesive quality&quot;. The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. According to Hume:

This view is supported by, for example, positivist interpreters, who have seen Hume as suggesting that terms such as &quot;self&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, or &quot;mind&quot; refer to collections of &quot;sense-contents&quot;. A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;.

However, some philosophers have criticised Hume&#x27;s bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relation to similarity and causality. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct &quot;bundles&quot; before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an ontological question, philosophers like Galen Strawson see Hume as not very concerned with such questions and have queried whether this view is really Hume&#x27;s. Instead, Strawson suggests that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self. In the Appendix to the &quot;Treatise&quot;, Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Corliss Swain notes that &quot;Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem&quot; when he reviewed the section on personal identity, &quot;he wasn&#x27;t forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix.&quot; One interpretation of Hume&#x27;s view of the self, argued for by philosopher and psychologist James Giles, is that Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. Rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume rejects the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a &quot;no-self theory&quot; and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought (see &quot;anattā&quot;). Psychologist Alison Gopnik has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.

=== Practical reason ===
&quot;Practical reason&quot; relates to whether standards or principles exist that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people&#x27;s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a sceptic of practical reason.

Hume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1740):

Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.&quot;

Since practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, &quot;Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.&quot; Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while &quot;A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence.&quot;

Practical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions, so Hume believed that reason&#x27;s shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people&#x27;s intentions and actions.

=== Ethics ===

Hume&#x27;s writings on ethics began in the 1740 &quot;Treatise&quot; and were refined in his &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&quot; (1751). He understood &quot;feeling&quot;, rather than &quot;knowing&quot;, as that which governs ethical actions, stating that &quot;moral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment.&quot; Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.
Hume&#x27;s &quot;moral sentimentalism&quot; was shared by his close friend Adam Smith, and the two were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary, Francis Hutcheson. Peter Singer claims that Hume&#x27;s argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone &quot;would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics.&quot;

Hume also put forward the &quot;is–ought problem&quot;, later known as &quot;Hume&#x27;s Law&quot;, denying the possibility of logically deriving what &quot;ought&quot; to be from what &quot;is&quot;. According to the &quot;Treatise&quot; (1740), in every system of morality that Hume has read, the author begins by stating facts about the world as it &quot;is&quot; but always ends up suddenly referring to what &quot;ought&quot; to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what &quot;ought to be&quot; the case, from &quot;what is&quot; the case. This is because it &quot;seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others.&quot;

Hume&#x27;s theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day meta-ethical theory, helping to inspire emotivism, and ethical expressivism and non-cognitivism, as well as Allan Gibbard&#x27;s general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.

=== Aesthetics ===
Hume&#x27;s ideas about aesthetics and the theory of art are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays &quot;Of the Standard of Taste&quot; and &quot;Of Tragedy&quot; (1757). His views are rooted in the work of Joseph Addison and Francis Hutcheson. In the &quot;Treatise&quot; (1740), he touches on the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue. His later writings on the subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art with conduct and character.

In &quot;Standard of Taste&quot;, Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and as having extensive experience. &quot;Of Tragedy&quot; addresses the question of why humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.

=== Free will, determinism, and responsibility ===

Hume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical compatibilist about the notions of freedom and determinism. &quot;Compatibilism&quot; seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist view that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, which is completely governed by physical laws. Hume, on this point, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution, particularly by Sir Isaac Newton. Hume argued that the dispute between freedom and determinism continued over 2000 years due to ambiguous terminology. He wrote: &quot;From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot…we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression,&quot; and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.

Hume defines the concept of necessity as &quot;the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together,&quot; and liberty as &quot;a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will.&quot; He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty &quot;requires&quot; necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would &quot;have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other.&quot; But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of &quot;chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence.&quot; Australian philosopher John Passmore writes that confusion has arisen because &quot;necessity&quot; has been taken to mean &quot;necessary connexion.&quot; Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that &quot;liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another.&quot;

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held morally responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:

Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some &quot;cause&quot; in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.

Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.

Education writer Richard Wright considers that Hume&#x27;s position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan&#x27;s ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has separate bales of hay on both sides, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.

Hume&#x27;s argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.

=== Religion ===
Philosopher Paul Russell (2005) contends that Hume wrote &quot;on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion&quot;, and that these writings &quot;are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic.&quot; Touching on the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought, Hume&#x27;s 1757 dissertation &quot;The Natural History of Religion&quot; argues that the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all derive from earlier polytheistic religions. He went on to suggest that all religious belief &quot;traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown&quot;. Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first &quot;Enquiry&quot;, as well as later in the &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;.

==== Religious views ====
Although he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume&#x27;s personal views have been the subject of much debate. Some modern critics have described Hume&#x27;s religious views as agnostic or have described him as a &quot;Pyrrhonian skeptic&quot;. Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, enough so that the Church of Scotland seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him. Evidence of his un-Christian beliefs can especially be found in his writings on miracles, in which he attempts to separate historical method from the narrative accounts of miracles. Nevertheless, modern scholars have tended to dismiss the claims of Hume&#x27;s contemporaries describing him as an atheist as coming from religiously intolerant people who did not understand Hume’s philosophy. The fact that contemporaries suspected him of atheism is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:

The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord&#x27;s prayer.

However, in works such as &quot;Of Superstition and Enthusiasm&quot;, Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the Catholic Church, dismissing it with the standard Protestant accusations of superstition and idolatry, as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs. He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called &quot;enthusiasts&quot;, to be corrupters of religion. By contrast, in &quot;The Natural History of Religion&quot;, Hume presents arguments suggesting that polytheism had much to commend it over monotheism. Additionally, when mentioning religion as a factor in his &quot;History of England&quot;, Hume uses it to show the deleterious effect it has on human progress. In his &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, Hume wrote: &quot;Generally speaking, the errors in religions are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.&quot;

Lou Reich (1998) argues that Hume was a religious naturalist and rejects interpretations of Hume as an atheist. Paul Russell (2008) writes that Hume was plainly sceptical about religious belief, although perhaps not to the extent of complete atheism. He suggests that Hume&#x27;s position is best characterised by the term &quot;irreligion,&quot; while philosopher David O&#x27;Connor (2013) argues that Hume&#x27;s final position was &quot;weakly deistic&quot;. For O&#x27;Connor, Hume&#x27;s &quot;position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of deism, he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position.&quot; He adds that Hume &quot;did not believe in the God of standard theism ... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity&quot;, and that &quot;ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion&quot;.

==== Design argument ====
One of the traditional topics of natural theology is that of the existence of God, and one of the &quot;a posteriori&quot; arguments for this is the &quot;argument from design&quot; or the teleological argument. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world, which &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states is &quot;the most popular&quot;, because it is:

...the most accessible of the theistic arguments ... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer ... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it.

In &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents &quot;always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled&quot;. Philosopher Louise E. Loeb (2010) notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume: 

We observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.

Hume also criticised the argument in his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot; (1779). Hume proposes a finite universe with a finite number of particles. Given infinite time, these particles could randomly fall into any arrangement, including our seemingly designed world.

A century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin&#x27;s discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life result from the natural selection of inherited characteristics. For philosopher James D. Madden, it is &quot;Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition&quot;.

Finally, Hume discussed a version of the anthropic principle, which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man&#x27;s existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a &quot;stupid mechanic&quot;. In his &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;, Hume wrote:

Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.
American philosopher Daniel Dennett has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although &quot;obviously ... an amusing philosophical fantasy&quot;, anticipated the notion of natural selection, the &#x27;continued improvement&#x27; being like &quot;any Darwinian selection algorithm&quot;.

==== Problem of miracles ====
In his discussion of miracles, Hume argues that we should not believe miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think God exists. In &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as &quot;a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent&quot;. Hume says we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur:

A wise man ... considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments. ... A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments ... and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.

Hume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible: &quot;[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.&quot;

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history. He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even when false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in &quot;ignorant and barbarous nations&quot; and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Hume recognizes that over a long period of time, various coincidences can provide the appearance of intention. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume&#x27;s requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.

Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his &quot;Enquiry&quot;. He states, &quot;I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.&quot; Thus, Hume&#x27;s argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a commonsense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.

The criterion for assessing Hume&#x27;s belief system is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.

Despite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that &quot;the gazing populace… receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder.&quot;

Critics have argued that Hume&#x27;s position assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that &quot;there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted.&quot; They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume&#x27;s philosophy, was especially problematic.

Little appreciated is the voluminous literature either foreshadowing Hume, in the likes of Thomas Sherlock or directly responding to and engaging with Hume—from William Paley, William Adams, John Douglas, John Leland, and George Campbell, among others. Regarding the latter, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell&#x27;s Dissertation, Hume remarked that &quot;the Scotch theologue had beaten him.&quot;

Hume&#x27;s main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either one&#x27;s senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken, Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume&#x27;s lights, this refusal is not wrong and the prince &quot;reasoned justly;&quot; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.

So, for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who &quot;is moved by faith to assent&quot; to revealed testimony &quot;is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.&quot; Hume writes that &quot;All the testimony whichever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision.&quot;

=== As a historian of England ===

From 1754 to 1762 Hume published &quot;The History of England&quot;, a six-volume work, that extends (according to its subtitle) &quot;From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688.&quot; Inspired by Voltaire&#x27;s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved &quot;the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind&quot;. It &quot;must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors.&quot; Hume&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; made him famous as a historian before he was ever considered a serious philosopher. In this work, Hume uses history to tell the story of the rise of England and what led to its greatness and the disastrous effects that religion has had on its progress. For Hume, the history of England&#x27;s rise may give a template for others who would also like to rise to its current greatness.

Hume&#x27;s &quot;The History of England&quot; was profoundly impacted by his Scottish background. The science of sociology, which is rooted in Scottish thinking of the eighteenth century, had never before been applied to British philosophical history. Because of his Scottish background, Hume was able to bring an outsider&#x27;s lens to English history that the insulated English whigs lacked.

Hume&#x27;s coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the Earl of Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England&quot; (1646–69). Generally, Hume took a moderate royalist position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that &quot;Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but ... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring.&quot; For &quot;Hume shared the ... Tory belief that the Stuarts were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors&quot;. &quot;Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the &quot;History&quot; as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy&quot;.
Historians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.

The debate between Tory and the Whig historians can be seen in the initial reception to Hume&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;. The whig-dominated world of 1754 overwhelmingly disapproved of Hume&#x27;s take on English history. In later editions of the book, Hume worked to &quot;soften or expunge many villainous whig strokes which had crept into it.&quot;

Hume did not consider himself a pure Tory. Before 1745, he was more akin to an &quot;independent whig.&quot; In 1748, he described himself as &quot;a whig, though a very skeptical one.&quot; This description of himself as in between whiggism and toryism, helps one understand that his &quot;History of England&quot; should be read as his attempt to work out his own philosophy of history.

Robert Roth argues that Hume&#x27;s histories display his biases against Presbyterians and Puritans. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.

Hume was an early cultural historian of science. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton. Hume particularly praised William Harvey, writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: &quot;Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science.&quot;

The &quot;History&quot; became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others. It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by Smollett (1757), Goldsmith (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.

=== Political theory ===

Many of Hume&#x27;s political ideas, such as limited government, private property when there is scarcity, and constitutionalism, are first principles of liberalism. Thomas Jefferson banned the &quot;History&quot; from University of Virginia, feeling that it had &quot;spread universal toryism over the land.&quot; By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume to be &quot;a Tory by chance [...] for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist.&quot; A major concern of Hume&#x27;s political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics, public spirit, and regard to the community.

Throughout the period of the American Revolution, Hume had varying views. For instance, in 1768 he encouraged total revolt on the part of the Americans. In 1775, he became certain that a revolution would take place and said that he believed in the American principle and wished the British government would let them be. Hume&#x27;s influence on some of the Founders can be seen in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s suggestion at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 that no high office in any branch of government should receive a salary, which is a suggestion Hume had made in his emendation of James Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Oceana&quot;.

The legacy of religious civil war in 18th-century Scotland, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, had fostered in Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to him to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided. Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he also clarified that a republic must produce laws, while &quot;monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law.&quot;

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny. However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain&#x27;s two political parties, the Whigs and the Tories, explaining that &quot;my views of &quot;things&quot; are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of &quot;persons&quot; to Tory prejudices&quot;.

The scholar Jerry Z. Muller argues that Hume&#x27;s political thoughts have characteristics that later became typical for American and British conservatism, which contain more positive views of capitalism than conservatism does elsewhere. Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a &quot;precautionary conservative,&quot; whose actions would have been &quot;determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate.&quot; Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for James Madison&#x27;s writings, and the essay &quot;Federalist No. 10&quot; in particular.

Hume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled &quot;Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth&quot;, which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that &quot;in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world&quot;. He defended a strict separation of powers, decentralisation, extending the franchise to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the Swiss militia was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid. Political philosophers Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, writing of Hume&#x27;s thoughts about &quot;the wise statesman&quot;, note that he &quot;will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age.&quot; Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the &quot;ancient fabric&quot;, in order not to disturb society.

In the political analysis of philosopher George Holland Sabine, the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of government by consent. He notes that &quot;allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive.&quot;

In the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence. He wrote in 1771 that &quot;our union with America…in the nature of things, cannot long subsist.&quot;

=== Contributions to economic thought ===

Hume expressed his economic views in his &quot;Political Discourses&quot;, which were incorporated in &quot;Essays and Treatises&quot; as Part II of &quot;Essays, Moral and Political&quot;. To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to assess; however, both of them had similar principles supported from historical events. At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;. However, he introduced several new ideas around which the &quot;classical economics&quot; of the 18th century was built. Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade. Referring to his essay &quot;Of the Balance of Trade&quot;, economist Paul Krugman (2012) has remarked that &quot;David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model.&quot;

In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, &quot;idle ceremonial,&quot; if all goods were unlimited and available freely. Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.

David Hume anticipated modern monetarism. First, Hume contributed to the theory of quantity and of interest rate. Hume has been credited with being the first to prove that, on an abstract level, there is no quantifiable amount of nominal money that a country needs to thrive. He understood that there was a difference between &quot;nominal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; money.

Second, Hume has a theory of causation which fits in with the Chicago-school &quot;black box&quot; approach. According to Hume, cause and effect are related only through correlation. Hume shared the belief with modern monetarists that changes in the supply of money can affect consumption and investment.

Lastly, Hume was a vocal advocate of a stable private sector, though also having some non-monetarist aspects to his economic philosophy. Having a stated preference for rising prices, for instance, Hume considered government debt to be a sort of substitute for actual money, referring to such debt as &quot;a kind of paper credit.&quot; He also believed in heavy taxation, believing that it increases effort. Hume&#x27;s economic approach evidently resembles his other philosophies, in that he does not choose one side indefinitely, but sees gray in the situation

== Legacy ==

Due to Hume&#x27;s vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called &quot;Humean.&quot;

The writings of Thomas Reid, a Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, were often critical of Hume&#x27;s scepticism. Reid formulated his &quot;common sense&quot; philosophy, in part, as a reaction against Hume&#x27;s views.

Hume influenced, and was influenced by, the Christian philosopher Joseph Butler. Hume was impressed by Butler&#x27;s way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume&#x27;s writings.

Attention to Hume&#x27;s philosophical works grew after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in his &quot;Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics&quot; (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his &quot;dogmatic slumber.&quot;

According to Arthur Schopenhauer, &quot;there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart and Schleiermacher taken together.&quot;

A. J. Ayer, while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed that his views were &quot;the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume&quot;.

Albert Einstein, in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume&#x27;s positivism when formulating his theory of special relativity.

Hume&#x27;s problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, &quot;Unended Quest&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Knowledge ... is &quot;objective&quot;; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume&#x27;s &quot;problem of induction&quot;.&quot; This insight resulted in Popper&#x27;s major work &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;. In his &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot;, he wrote that he &quot;approached the problem of induction through Hume&quot;, since Hume was &quot;perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified&quot;.

Hume&#x27;s rationalism in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian Johann Joachim Spalding, the German neology school and rational theology, and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the Age of Enlightenment. Hume pioneered a comparative history of religion, tried to explain various rites and traditions as being based on deception and challenged various aspects of rational and natural theology, such as the argument from design.

Danish theologian and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard adopted &quot;Hume&#x27;s suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance,&quot; though taking it as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or &quot;fideism&quot;. The &quot;fact that Christianity is contrary to reason…is the necessary precondition for true faith.&quot; Political theorist Isaiah Berlin, who has also pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against rational theology, has written about Hume&#x27;s influence on what Berlin calls the &quot;counter-Enlightenment&quot; and on German anti-rationalism. Berlin has also once said of Hume that &quot;no man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree.&quot;

In 2003, philosopher Jerry Fodor described Hume&#x27;s &quot;Treatise&quot; as &quot;the founding document of cognitive science.&quot;

Hume engaged with contemporary intellectuals including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, James Boswell, and Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume&#x27;s influence on his economics and political philosophy).

Morris and Brown (2019) write that Hume is &quot;generally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write in English.&quot;

In September 2020, the David Hume Tower, a University of Edinburgh building, was renamed to 40 George Square; this was following a campaign led by students of the university to rename it, in objection to Hume&#x27;s writings related to race.

== Works ==
* 1734. &quot;A Kind of History of My Life&quot;. – MSS 23159 National Library of Scotland.
** A letter to an unnamed physician, asking for advice about &quot;the Disease of the Learned&quot; that then afflicted him. Here he reports that at the age of eighteen &quot;there seem&#x27;d to be open&#x27;d up to me a new Scene of Thought&quot; that made him &quot;throw up every other Pleasure or Business&quot; and turned him to scholarship.
* 1739–1740. &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects&quot;.
** Hume intended to see whether the &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot; met with success, and if so, to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, as Hume explained, &quot;It fell &quot;dead-born from the press&quot;, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots&quot; and so his further project was not completed.
* 1740. &quot;An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc&quot;.
** Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume in an attempt to popularise his &quot;Treatise&quot;. This work is of considerable philosophical interest as it spells out what Hume considered &quot;The Chief Argument&quot; of the &quot;Treatise&quot;, in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the &quot;Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.
* 1741. &quot;Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary&quot; (2nd ed.)
** A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–54. Many of the essays are on politics and economics; other topics include aesthetic judgement, love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome. The Essays show some influence from Addison&#x27;s &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* 1745. &quot;A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles Concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain&#x27;d in a Book lately publish&#x27;d, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc&quot;.
** Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a chair at Edinburgh University.
* 1742. &quot;Of Essay Writing.&quot;
* 1748. &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.&quot;
** Contains reworking of the main points of the &quot;Treatise&quot;, Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. &quot;Of Miracles&quot;, section X of the &quot;Enquiry&quot;, was often published separately.
* 1751. &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals.&quot;
** A reworking of material on morality from Book 3 of the &quot;Treatise&quot;, but with a significantly different emphasis. It &quot;was thought by Hume to be the best of his writings.&quot;
* 1752. &quot;Political Discourses&quot; (part II of &quot;Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary&quot; within the larger &quot;Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects&quot;, vol. 1).
** Included in &quot;Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects&quot; (1753–56) reprinted 1758–77.
* 1752–1758. &quot;Political Discourses&quot;/&quot;Discours politiques&quot;
* 1757. &quot;Four Dissertations –&quot; includes 4 essays:
** &quot;The Natural History of Religion&quot;
** &quot;Of the Passions&quot;
** &quot;Of Tragedy&quot;
** &quot;Of the Standard of Taste&quot;
* 1754–1762. &quot;The History of England&quot; – sometimes referred to as &quot;The History of Great Britain&quot;.
** More a category of books than a single work, Hume&#x27;s history spanned &quot;from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688&quot; and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it &quot;the&quot; standard history of England in its day.
* 1760. &quot;Sister Peg&quot;
** Hume claimed to have authored an anonymous political pamphlet satirizing the failure of the British Parliament to create a Scottish militia in 1760. Although the authorship of the work is disputed, Hume wrote Alexander Carlyle in early 1761 claiming authorship. The readership of the time attributed the work to Adam Ferguson, a friend and associate of Hume&#x27;s who has been sometimes called &quot;the founder of modern sociology&quot;. Some contemporary scholars concur in the judgment that Ferguson, not Hume, was the author of this work.
* 1776. &quot;My Own Life.&quot;
** Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of &quot;Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects&quot;. It was first published by Adam Smith, who claimed that by doing so he had incurred &quot;ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain.&quot;
* 1777. &quot;Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul.&quot;
* 1779. &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot;.
** Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume&#x27;s own.

<doc id="7928" wikidata="Q350666" url="?curid=7928" title="Dalton Trumbo">
<text>James Dalton Trumbo (December 9, 1905 – September 10, 1976) was an American screenwriter who scripted many award-winning films, including &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot; (both 1960), and &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944). One of the Hollywood Ten, he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee&#x27;s investigation of alleged Communist influences in the motion picture industry.

Trumbo, the other members of the Hollywood Ten, and hundreds of other professionals in the industry were blacklisted by Hollywood. He continued working clandestinely on major films, writing under pseudonyms or other authors&#x27; names. His uncredited work won two Academy Awards for Best Story: for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), which was presented to a front writer, and for &quot;The Brave One&quot; (1956), which was awarded to a pseudonym used by Trumbo. When he was given public screen credit for both &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot; in 1960, it marked the beginning of the end of the Hollywood Blacklist for Trumbo and other affected screenwriters. He finally was given full credit by the Writers&#x27; Guild for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; in 2011, nearly 60 years after the fact, and 35 years after his death.

==Origins==
Trumbo was born in Montrose, Colorado, on December 9, 1905, the son of Orus Bonham Trumbo and Maud (née Tillery) Trumbo. His family moved to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 1908.

His paternal immigrant ancestor, a Protestant of Swiss origin named Jacob Trumbo, settled in the colony of Virginia in 1736. Orus Trumbo worked variously as a shoe clerk and collection agent, never earning enough to keep the family far from poverty.

Trumbo graduated from Grand Junction High School. While still in high school, he worked for Walter Walker as a cub reporter for the &quot;Grand Junction Daily Sentinel,&quot; covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations. He attended the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1924 and 1925, working as a reporter for the &quot;Boulder Daily Camera&quot; and contributing to the school&#x27;s humor magazine, yearbook, and newspaper. He was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.

In 1924, Orus Trumbo relocated the family to California. Shortly after, he fell ill and died, leaving Dalton to support his mother and siblings. For nine years after his father died, Trumbo worked the night shift wrapping bread at a Los Angeles bakery and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (1926) and the University of Southern California (1928–1930). During this time, he wrote movie reviews, 88 short stories, and six novels, all of which were rejected for publication.

==Career==
===Early career===
Trumbo began his professional writing career in the early 1930s, when several of his articles and stories were published in mainstream magazines, including &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, the &quot;Hollywood Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Trumbo was hired as managing editor of the &quot;Hollywood Spectator&quot; in 1934. Later he left the magazine to become a reader in the story department at Warner Bros. studio.

His first published novel, &quot;Eclipse&quot; (1935), was released during the Great Depression. Writing in the social realist style, Trumbo drew on his years in Grand Junction to portray a town and its people. The book was controversial in his hometown, where many people took issue with his fictional portrayal.

Trumbo started working in movies in 1937 but continued writing prose. His anti-war novel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939. It was inspired by an article Trumbo had read several years earlier: an account of a hospital visit by the Prince of Wales to a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in World War I.

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Trumbo became one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid screenwriters, at about $4,000 per week while on assignment, and earning as much as $80,000 in one year. He worked on such films as &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944), &quot;Our Vines Have Tender Grapes&quot; (1945), and &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot; (1940), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

===Political advocacy and blacklisting===

Aligned with the Communist Party USA before the 1940s, Trumbo was an isolationist. He joined the Communist Party in 1943, and remained active until 1947. He reaffiliated himself with the party in 1954. His novel &quot;The Remarkable Andrew&quot; featured the ghost of President Andrew Jackson appearing to caution the United States against getting involved in World War II and in support of the Nazi-Soviet pact.

Shortly after Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals &quot;denouncing Jews&quot; and using &quot;Johnny&quot; to support their arguments for &quot;an immediate negotiated peace&quot; with Nazi Germany; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the FBI. Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called &quot;foolish&quot;. After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that &quot;their interest lay not in the letters but in me&quot;.

In a 1946 article titled &quot;The Russian Menace&quot; published in Rob Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Script Magazine&quot;, Trumbo wrote from the perspective of a post-World War II Russian citizen. He argued that Russians were likely fearful of the mass of U.S. military power that surrounded them, at a time when any sympathetic view toward Communist countries was viewed with suspicion. He ended the article by stating, &quot;If I were a Russian ... I would be alarmed, and I would petition my government to take measures at once against what would seem an almost certain blow aimed at my existence. This is how it must appear in Russia today&quot;. He argued that the U.S. was a &quot;menace&quot; to Russia, rather than the more popular American view of Russia as the &quot;red menace&quot;. According to author Kenneth Billingsley, Trumbo had bragged in &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; that Communist influence in Hollywood had prevented films from being made from anti-Communist books, such as Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; and &quot;The Yogi and the Commissar&quot;.

William R. Wilkerson, publisher and founder of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, published a July 29, 1946, &quot;TradeView&quot; column entitled &quot;A Vote For Joe Stalin&quot;. It named Trumbo and several others as Communist sympathizers, the first persons identified on what became known as &quot;Billy&#x27;s Blacklist&quot;. In October 1947, drawing upon these names, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) summoned Trumbo and nine others to testify for their investigation as to whether Communist agents and sympathizers had surreptitiously planted propaganda in U.S. films. The writers refused to give information about their own or any other person&#x27;s involvement and were convicted for contempt of Congress. They appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds and lost. Trumbo served eleven months in the federal penitentiary in Ashland, Kentucky, in 1950. In the 1976 documentary &quot;Hollywood On Trial&quot;, Trumbo said: &quot;As far as I was concerned, it was a completely just verdict. I had contempt for that Congress and have had contempt for it ever since. And on the basis of guilt or innocence, I could never really complain very much. That this was a crime or misdemeanor was the complaint, my complaint.&quot;

The MPAA issued a statement that Trumbo and his compatriots would not be permitted to work in the industry unless they disavowed Communism under oath. After completing his sentence, Trumbo sold his ranch and moved his family to Mexico City with Hugo Butler and his wife Jean Rouverol, who had also been blacklisted. In Mexico, Trumbo wrote 30 scripts (under pseudonyms) for B-movie studios such as King Brothers Productions. In the case of &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950), adapted from a short story by MacKinlay Kantor, Kantor agreed to be the front for Trumbo&#x27;s screenplay. Trumbo&#x27;s role in the screenplay was not revealed until 1992.

During this blacklist period, Trumbo also wrote &quot;The Brave One&quot; (1956) for the King Brothers. Like &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, it received an Academy Award for Best Story he could not claim. The script was credited to Robert Rich, a name borrowed from a nephew of the producers. Trumbo recalled earning an average fee of $1,750 per film for 18 screenplays written in two years and said, &quot;None was very good&quot;.

He published &quot;The Devil in the Book&quot;, an analysis of the conviction of 14 California Smith Act defendants, in 1956. The statute set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government.

===Later career===
Ingo Preminger, the brother of producer-director Otto Preminger, was Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s agent. Otto Preminger hired Trumbo to write a screenplay for the film he intended to adapt from Leon Uris&#x27; 1958 novel &quot;Exodus&quot; when the script he had commissioned from Uris was deemed unusable. The producer-director decided to give Trumbo the screen credit. Shortly thereafter, actor Kirk Douglas announced Trumbo had written the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Spartacus&quot; (also 1960), adapted from the 1951 novel by Howard Fast. With these actions, Preminger and Douglas helped end the power of the blacklist.

Trumbo was reinstated into the Writers Guild of America, West and was credited on all subsequent scripts. The guild finally gave him full credit for the script of the 1953 film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; in 2011. Trumbo directed the 1971 film adaptation of his novel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;, starring Timothy Bottoms, Diane Varsi, Jason Robards and Donald Sutherland. One of the last films Trumbo wrote, &quot;Executive Action&quot; (1973), was based on the John F. Kennedy assassination. The Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner of the Oscar for the 1956 film &quot;The Brave One&quot; in 1975, presenting him with a statuette.

==Personal life==
In 1938, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher, who was born in Fresno, California, on July 17, 1916, and had moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. The Trumbos had three children: Nikola Trumbo (1939–2018), who became a psychotherapist; Christopher Trumbo (1940–2011), a filmmaker and screenwriter who became an expert on the Hollywood blacklist; and Melissa Trumbo (1945), known as Mitzi, a photographer. Mitzi Trumbo dated comedian Steve Martin when they were both in their early 20s, which is recounted in Martin&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Born Standing Up&quot;. Martin wrote of her: &quot;Mitzi became my official photographer, and she snapped dozens of rolls of film, all to find the perfect publicity photo.&quot;

Cleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009, at the home she shared with Mitzi Trumbo in Los Altos, California.

==Death and legacy==
Trumbo died in 1976, in Los Angeles of a heart attack at the age of 70. He donated his body to scientific research.

In 1993, Trumbo was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for writing &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953). The screen credit and award were previously given to Ian McLellan Hunter, who had been a front for Trumbo. A new statue was made for this award because Hunter&#x27;s son refused to hand over the one his father had received.

In 2003, Christopher Trumbo mounted an Off-Broadway play based on his father&#x27;s letters, called &quot;Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted&quot;, in which a wide variety of actors played his father during the run, including Nathan Lane, Tim Robbins, Brian Dennehy, Ed Harris, Chris Cooper and Gore Vidal. He adapted it as the documentary &quot;Trumbo&quot; (2007), which added archival footage and new interviews.

A dramatization of Trumbo&#x27;s life, also called &quot;Trumbo&quot;, was released in November 2015. It starred Bryan Cranston in the title role and was directed by Jay Roach. For his portrayal of Trumbo, Cranston was nominated for Best Actor at the 88th Academy Awards.

The moving image collection of Trumbo is held at the Academy Film Archive and consists primarily of extensive 35 mm production materials relating to the 1971 anti-war film &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;. In 2016, more than a hundred years after his birth, Trumbo was honored by the installation of a statue of him in front of the Avalon Theater on Main Street in Grand Junction, Colorado, his home town. He was depicted writing a screenplay in a bathtub.

Trumbo is featured in the 2024 biographical historical drama &quot;Reagan&quot; about U.S. president Ronald Reagan. He is portrayed by Sean Hankinson.

<text>Delaware ( ) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic regions of the United States. It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state&#x27;s name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia&#x27;s first colonial-era governor.

Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. Delaware&#x27;s most populous city is Wilmington, and the state&#x27;s capital is Dover, the second-most populous city in Delaware. The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex counties, historically have been predominantly agrarian economies. New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan statistical area that surrounds Philadelphia. Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S. Census Bureau, but the state&#x27;s geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country.

Before the Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 16th century, the state was inhabited by several Native American tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631. Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that participated in the American Revolution against Great Britain, which established the United States as an independent nation. On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, earning it the nickname &quot;The First State&quot;.

Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore corporate haven whose corporate laws are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 are legally incorporated in Delaware. Over 90% of all U.S. based companies that went public in 2021 incorporated themselves in Delaware.

==Etymology==
Delaware was named after its location on the Delaware Bay, which in turn derived its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577–1618), the first governor of the Colony of Virginia. The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for Lenape people Indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.

The name &quot;de La Warr&quot; was derived from Sussex and is of Anglo-French origin. It came probably from a Norman lieu-dit &quot;La Guerre&quot;. This toponymic likely derived from Latin &quot;&quot;, the Breton &quot;&quot; or from the Late Latin (fallow). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire, (the sound [ä] often mutated in [æ]) also appear in historical texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word &quot;ga(i)ra&quot; means gore. It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse &quot;&quot;.

==History==

===Native Americans===
Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the present-day state was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the Nanticoke who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of the Nanticoke—they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay. The Kuskarawocks were most likely the Tuscarora.

The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the Allegheny Mountains by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.

===Colonial Delaware===

The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631. Within a year, all the settlers were killed in a dispute with Native American tribes living in the area. In 1638, New Sweden, a Swedish trading post and colony, was established at Fort Christina (now in Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle and, in 1655, they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland. Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York. Fighting off a prior claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, Proprietor of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot; from the Duke.

Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had grown so large their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique; from 1703 to 1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor. Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.

Dependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.

===American Revolution===
Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with Britain. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.

New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the &quot;Penman of the Revolution&quot;. Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware&#x27;s majority, George Read, could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware&#x27;s vote for independence.

Initially led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army, known as the &quot;Delaware Blues&quot; and nicknamed the &quot;Blue Hen&#x27;s Chicks&quot;. In August 1777 General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the Battle of Brandywine and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch&#x27;s Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch&#x27;s Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778.

Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active Loyalist portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.

Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.

===Slavery and race===
Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as indentured servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.

Most of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men. Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.

By the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves&#x27; labor. In addition local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810, three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware&#x27;s largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.

Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the 1860 census on the verge of the Civil War, 91.7% of the black population were free; 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 &quot;free colored persons&quot;.

An independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave Peter Spencer as the &quot;Union Church of Africans&quot;. This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination. This was renamed as the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, more commonly known as the A.U.M.P. Church. In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the Big August Quarterly, which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival.

Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War but rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901, decades after they had already come into force.

===Reconstruction and industrialization===
During the Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War, Democratic Redeemer governments led by the South&#x27;s Bourbon aristocracy continued to dominate the region and imposed explicitly white supremacist regimes in the former slave states. The Delaware legislature declared Black people to be second-class citizens in 1866, and restricted their voting rights despite the 15th Amendment, ensuring continued Democratic success in the state throughout most of the 19th century. Fearful that the 1875 Civil Rights Act passed by Congress might establish racial equality, Delaware legislators passed Jim Crow laws that mandated segregation in public facilities. The state&#x27;s educational system was segregated by operation of law. Delaware&#x27;s segregation was written into the state constitution, which, while providing at Article X, Section 2, that &quot;no distinction shall be made on account of race or color&quot;, nonetheless required that &quot;separate schools for white and colored children shall be maintained.&quot;

Beginning in the late 19th century, the Wilmington area grew into a manufacturing center. Investment in manufacturing in the city grew from $5.5 million in 1860 to $44 million in 1900. The most notable manufacturer in the state was the chemical company DuPont, which to this day is heavily credited with making the state what it is today in many ways. Because of Wilmington&#x27;s growth, local politicians from the city and New Castle County pressured the state government to adopt a new constitution providing the north with more representation. However, the subsequent 1897 constitution did not proportionally represent the north and continued to give the southern counties disproportionate influence.

As manufacturing expanded, businesses became major players in state affairs and funders of politicians through families such as the Du Ponts. Republican John Addicks attempted to buy a US Senate seat multiple times in a rivalry with the Du Ponts until the passage of the 17th Amendment. The allegiance of industries with the Republican party allowed them to gain control of the state&#x27;s governorship throughout most of the 20th century. The GOP ensured black people could vote because of their general support for Republicans and thus undid restrictions on Black suffrage.

Delaware benefited greatly from World War I because of the state&#x27;s large gunpowder industry. DuPont, the most dominant business in the state by WWI, produced an estimated 40% of all gunpowder used by the Allies during the war. It produced nylon in the state after the war and began investments into General Motors. Additionally, the company invested heavily in the expansion of public schools in the state and colleges such as the University of Delaware in the 1910s and 1920s. This included primary and secondary schools for Black people and women. Delaware suffered less during the Great Depression than other states, but the depression spurred further migration from the rural south to urban areas.

===World War II to present===
Like in World War I, the state enjoyed a big stimulus to its gunpowder and shipyard industries in World War II. New job opportunities during and after the war in the Wilmington area coaxed Black people from the southern counties to move to the city. The proportion of blacks constituting the city&#x27;s population rose from 15% in 1950 to over 50% by 1980. The surge of Black migrants to the north sparked white flight, in which middle class whites moved from the city to suburban areas, leading to &quot;de facto&quot; segregation of Northern Delaware&#x27;s society. In the 1940s and 1950s, Delaware attempted to integrate its schools, although the last segregated school in the state did not close until 1970. The University of Delaware admitted its first black student in 1948, and local courts ruled that primary schools had to be integrated. Delaware&#x27;s integration efforts partially inspired the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which found racial segregation in United States public schools to be unconstitutional. The result of the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling was that Delaware became fully integrated, albeit with time and much effort.

In October 1954, the city of Milford became the scene of one of the country&#x27;s first pro-segregation boycotts after eleven Black students were enrolled in the previously all-white Milford High School. Mass protests continued in Milford; the school board eventually ceded to the protestors, expelling the Black students. The ensuing unrest, which included cross burnings, rallies, and pro-segregation demonstrations, contributed to desegregation in most of Southern Delaware being delayed for another ten years. Sussex County did not start closing or integrating its segregated schools until 1965, 11 years after the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling. Throughout the state, integration only encouraged more white flight, and poor economic conditions for the black population led to some violence during the 1960s. Riots broke out in Wilmington in 1967 and again in 1968 in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, after which the National Guard occupied the city for nine months to prevent further violence.

Since WWII, the state has been generally economically prosperous and enjoyed relatively high per capita income because of its location between major cities like Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC. Its population grew rapidly, particularly in the suburbs in the north where New Castle county became an extension of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Americans, including migrants from Puerto Rico, and immigrants from Latin America flocked to the state. By 1990, only 50% of Delaware&#x27;s population consisted of natives to the state.

==Geography==



Delaware is long and ranges from across, with a land area of and a total area of , making it the second-smallest state by either metric in the United States after Rhode Island. Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey, and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle. This boundary is often referred to as the Twelve-Mile Circle. Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the U.S. that is a true arc, the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs, and many cities in the South (such as Plains, Georgia) also have circular boundaries.

This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River.

On the west, Delaware and Maryland are mostly separated by a line running from the midpoint of the Transpeninsular Line, going slightly west of due north up to its tangent point on the Twelve-Mile Circle. The border follows the Circle for a short distance and then continues in a straight line due north until reaching the southern border of Pennsylvania. The Wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware&#x27;s claim was confirmed.

===Topography===
Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation. Its highest elevation, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than above sea level. The northernmost part of the state is part of the Piedmont Plateau with hills and rolling surfaces.

The Atlantic Seaboard fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground. A ridge about high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the watersheds that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west.

===Climate===
Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state lies in the humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) zone. Despite its small size (roughly from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state.

Summers are long, hot, and humid in Delaware, often with intense (but brief) late day thundershowers. Delaware averages 2,300 hrs of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). Winters are modestly cool to cold in northern Delaware, and cool to mild in southern Delaware. The normal seasonal snowfall ranges from about 20.0 inches in Wilmington to only 10.0 inches in Lewes. In many winters no snow will fall in coastal Delaware. Northern Delaware falls into USDA Garden Zone 7a, while southern and coastal areas fall into USDA zone 7b and 8a. The milder climate in southern Delaware allows for subtropical flora such as the windmill palm, needle palm, and dwarf palmetto.

Delaware&#x27;s all-time record high of was recorded at Millsboro on July 21, 1930. The all-time record low of was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893. The hardiness zones are 7B and 8A at the Delaware Beaches.

===Environment===
The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests. Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of bald cypress trees in North America.

===Environmental management===

Delaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property &quot;lightly contaminated&quot; by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.

==Municipalities==
Wilmington is the state&#x27;s most populous city (70,635) and its economic hub. It is located within commuting distance of both Philadelphia and Baltimore. Dover is the state capital and the second most populous city (38,079).

==Demographics==


The United States Census Bureau determined that the population of Delaware was 989,948 on April 1, 2020, an increase from the 2010 census figure of 897,934.

Delaware&#x27;s history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Generally, the rural Southern (or &quot;Slower Lower&quot;) regions of Delaware below the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal embody a Southern culture, while densely-populated Northern Delaware above the canal—particularly Wilmington, a part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area—has more in common with that of the Northeast and the North. The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States or northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.

Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware is one of five U.S. states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. The center of population of Delaware is in New Castle County, in the town of Townsend.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,369 homeless people in Delaware.

===Race and ethnicity===

According to the 2010 United States census, the racial composition of the state was 68.9% White American (65.3% Non-Hispanic White, 3.6% White Hispanic), 21.4% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian American, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 3.4% some other race, and 2.7% of multiracial origin. People of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race, made up 8.2% of the population.

The 2022 American Community Survey estimated the state had a racial and ethnic makeup of 60.6% non-Hispanic whites, 23.6% Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.9% multiracial, and 10.1% Hispanic or Latin American of any race.

In the Native American community, the state has a Native American group, called in their own language Lenape, which was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware. A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.

Delaware&#x27;s population mainly consisted of people from the British Isles, African slaves, Germans and a few remaining Native Americans during the colonial era. Irish, Germans, Italians, Poles, and Russian Jewish immigrants were attracted by the industries in the Wilmington area. In the late 20th century a Puerto Rican community formed in Wilmington. Guatemalan people migrated to Sussex county to work in Delaware&#x27;s poultry industry. A group of Native Americans in Delaware of mixed ethnicity, the Moors, live in Cheswold. The descendants of the Nanticoke people live around Millsboro. There is also a small numbers of Asians in New Castle county who work as scientific and engineering professionals.

The top countries of origin for Delaware&#x27;s immigrants in 2018 were Mexico, India, Guatemala, China, and Jamaica.

===Birth data===
&quot;Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.&quot;
* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Languages===
In 2000, 91% of Delaware residents of age5 and older spoke only English at home; 5% spoke Spanish. French was the third most spoken language, used by 0.7% of the population, followed by Chinese (0.5%) and German (0.5%). Legislation has been proposed in both the House and the Senate in Delaware to designate English as the official language. Neither bill was passed in the legislature.

===Sexual orientation===
A 2012 Gallup poll found that Delaware&#x27;s proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults stood at 3.4% of the population. This constitutes a total LGBT adult population estimate of 23,698 people. The number of same-sex couple households in 2010 stood at 2,646. This grew by 41.65% from a decade earlier. On July 1, 2013, same-sex marriage was legalized, and all civil unions were converted into marriages.

===Religion===
The predominant religion practiced in Delaware is Christianity. A 2014 estimate by the Pew Research Center found that members of Protestant churches accounted for almost half of the population, though the Roman Catholic Church was the largest single denomination in the state. By 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 61% of the population was Christian. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute&#x27;s survey revealed 60% were Christian, followed by Jews (3%), Hindus (1%), and New Agers (1%).

The Association of Religion Data Archives reported in 2010 that the three largest Christian denominational groups in Delaware by number of adherents are the Catholic Church at 182,532 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 53,656 members reported, and non-denominational evangelical Protestants, who numbered 22,973. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Christian denominations were the Catholic Church with 197,094; non-denominational Protestants with 49,392, and United Methodists with 39,959.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington and the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware oversee the parishes within their denominations. The A.U.M.P. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Reflecting new immigrant populations, an Islamic mosque has been built in the Ogletown area, and a Hindu temple in Hockessin.

Delaware is home to an Amish community which resides west of Dover in Kent County, consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people. The Amish first settled in Kent County in 1915. In recent years, increasing development has led to the decline in the number of Amish living in the community.

A 2012 survey of religious attitudes in the United States found that 34% of Delaware residents considered themselves &quot;moderately religious&quot;, 33% &quot;very religious&quot;, and 33% as &quot;non-religious&quot;. At the 2014 Pew Research survey, 23% of the population were irreligious; the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute&#x27;s survey determined 31% of the population were irreligious. In 2022, the same study showed 33% of the population as irreligious.

==Economy==

===Affluence===
According to a 2020 study by Kiplinger, Delaware had the 17th most millionaires per capita in the United States; altogether, there were 25,937 such individuals. The median income for Delaware households as of 2020 was $64,805.

===Agriculture===

Delaware&#x27;s agricultural output consists of poultry, nursery stock, soybeans, dairy products and corn.

===Industries===
, the state&#x27;s unemployment rate was 3.7%.

The state&#x27;s largest employers are:
* government (State of Delaware, New Castle County)
* education (University of Delaware, Delaware Technical Community College)
* banking (Bank of America, M&amp;T Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank)
* chemical, pharmaceutical, technology (DuPont de Nemours Inc., AstraZeneca, Syngenta, Agilent Technologies)
* healthcare (ChristianaCare (Christiana Hospital), Bayhealth Medical Center, Nemours Children&#x27;s Hospital, Delaware)
* farming, specifically chicken farming in Sussex County (Perdue Farms, Mountaire Farms, Allen Family Foods)
* retail (Walmart, Walgreens, Acme Markets)

====Industrial decline====

Since the mid-2000s, Delaware has seen the departure of the state&#x27;s automotive manufacturing industry (General Motors Wilmington Assembly and Chrysler Newark Assembly), the corporate buyout of a major bank holding company (MBNA), the departure of the state&#x27;s steel industry (Evraz Claymont Steel), the bankruptcy of a fiber mill (National Vulcanized Fiber), and the diminishing presence of AstraZeneca in Wilmington.

In late 2015, DuPont announced that 1,700 employees, nearly a third of its footprint in Delaware, would be laid off in early 2016. The merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. and Dow Chemical Company into DowDuPont took place on September 1, 2017.

===Incorporation in Delaware===

More than half of all U.S. publicly traded companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated in Delaware. The state&#x27;s attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business-friendly corporation law. Franchise taxes on Delaware corporations supply about a fifth of the state&#x27;s revenue. Although &quot;USA (Delaware)&quot; ranked as the world&#x27;s most opaque jurisdiction on the Tax Justice Network&#x27;s 2009 Financial Secrecy Index, the same group&#x27;s 2011 Index ranks the U.S. fifth and does not specify Delaware. In Delaware, there are more than a million registered corporations, meaning there are more corporations than people.

===Food and drink===

 stipulates that alcoholic liquor be sold only in specifically licensed establishments, and only between 9:00a.m. and 1:00a.m. Until 2003, Delaware was among the several states enforcing blue laws and banned the sale of liquor on Sunday.

==Media==

=== Newspapers ===
Two daily newspapers are based in Delaware, the &quot;Delaware State News&quot;, based in Dover and covering the two southern counties, and &quot;The News Journal&quot; covering Wilmington and northern Delaware. The state is also served by several weekly, monthly and online publications.

===Television===
No standalone television stations are based solely in Delaware. The northern part of the state is served by network stations in Philadelphia and the southern part by network stations in Salisbury, Maryland. Philadelphia&#x27;s ABC affiliate, WPVI-TV, maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington. Salisbury&#x27;s CBS affiliate, WBOC-TV, maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton. Three Philadelphia-market stations—PBS member WHYY-TV, Ion affiliate WPPX, and MeTV affiliate WDPN-TV—all have Wilmington as their city of license, but maintain transmitters at the market antenna farm in Roxborough, Philadelphia and do not produce any Delaware-centric programming.
===Radio===
There are a numerous radio stations licensed in Delaware. WDDE 91.1 FM, WDEL 1150AM, WHGE-LP 95.3 FM, WILM 1450 AM, WVCW 99.5, WMPH 91.7 FM, WSTW 93.7 FM, WTMC 1380 AM and WWTX 1290AM are licensed from Wilmington. WRDX 92.9 FM is licensed from Smyrna. WDOV 1410AM, WDSD 94.7 FM and WRTX 91.7 FM are licensed from Dover.

==Tourism==
Delaware is home to First State National Historical Park, a National Park Service unit composed of historic sites across the state including the New Castle Court House, Green, and Sheriff&#x27;s House, Dover Green, Beaver Valley, Fort Christina, Old Swedes&#x27; Church, John Dickinson Plantation, and the Ryves Holt House. Delaware has several museums, wildlife refuges, parks, houses, lighthouses, and other historic places.

Rehoboth Beach, together with the towns of Lewes, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, and Fenwick Island, comprise Delaware&#x27;s beach resorts. Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Summer Capital&quot; because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C., residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town&#x27;s charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax-free shopping. According to SeaGrant Delaware, the Delaware beaches generate $6.9billion annually and over $711million in tax revenue.

Delaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events. Some of the more notable festivals are the Riverfest held in Seaford, the World Championship Punkin Chunkin formerly held at various locations throughout the state since 1986, the Rehoboth Beach Chocolate Festival, the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral to mark the end of summer, the Apple Scrapple Festival held in Bridgeville, the Clifford Brown Jazz Festival in Wilmington, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival, the Sea Witch Halloween Festival and Parade in Rehoboth Beach, the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Nanticoke Indian Pow Wow in Oak Orchard, Firefly Music Festival, and the Return Day Parade held after every election in Georgetown.

In 2015, tourism in Delaware generated $3.1billion, which makes up five percent of the state&#x27;s GDP. Delaware saw 8.5million visitors in 2015, with the tourism industry employing 41,730 people, making it the 4th largest private employer in the state. Major origin markets for Delaware tourists include Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg, with 97% of tourists arriving to the state by car and 75% of tourists coming from a distance of or less.

Delaware is also home to two large sporting venues. Dover Motor Speedway is a race track in Dover, and Frawley Stadium in Wilmington is the home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, a Minor League Baseball team that is currently affiliated with the Washington Nationals.

==Education==

In the early 1920s, Pierre S. du Pont served as president of the state board of education. At the time, state law prohibited money raised from white taxpayers from being used to support the state&#x27;s schools for black children. Appalled by the condition of the black schools, du Pont donated four million dollars to construct 86 new school buildings.

Delaware was the origin of &quot;Belton v. Gebhart&quot; (1952), one of the four cases which were combined into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States decision that led to the end of officially segregated public schools. Significantly, &quot;Belton&quot; was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.

Unlike many states, Delaware&#x27;s educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions. This centralized system, combined with the small size of the state, likely contributed to Delaware becoming the first state, after completion of a three-year, $30million program ending in 1999, to wire every K-12 classroom in the state to the Internet.

, the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 charter schools in the state, one of them being all-girls.

All teachers in the State&#x27;s public school districts are unionized. , none of the State&#x27;s charter schools are members of a teachers union. One of the State&#x27;s teachers&#x27; unions is Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).

===Colleges and universities===

* Delaware College of Art and Design
* Delaware State University
* Delaware Technical &amp; Community College
* Goldey-Beacom College
* University of Delaware—Ranked 63rd in the U.S. and in top 201–250 in the world (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018)
* Widener University School of Law
* Wilmington University

==Transportation==
The transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT). Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations. DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt-a-Highway program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as &quot;DART First State&quot;, the state government public transportation organization), and others.

In 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 lane-miles, totaling 89 percent of the state&#x27;s public roadway system, the rest being under the supervision of individual municipalities. This far exceeds the national average (20 percent) for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility.

===Roads===
One major branch of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, Interstate95 (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. Two Auxiliary Interstate Highway routes are also located in the state. Interstate 495 (I-495) is an eastern bypass of Wilmington. Interstate 295 (I-295) is a bypass of Philadelphia which begins south of Wilmington. In addition to Interstate highways, there are six U.S. highways that serve Delaware: U.S.9, U.S.13, U.S.40, U.S.113, U.S.202, and U.S.301. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE1, DE9, and DE404. U.S.13 and DE1 are primary north–south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the Delaware beaches. DE9 is a north–south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the Delaware Bay. U.S.40 is a primary east–west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE404 is another primary east–west highway connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland with the Delaware beaches. The state also operates three toll highways, the Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle; the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE1, between Wilmington and Dover; and the U.S. 301 toll road between the Maryland border and DE1 in New Castle County.

A bicycle route, Delaware Bicycle Route 1, spans the north–south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.

Delaware has about 875 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of the number are included in the National Bridge Inventory. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which is under the bi-state Delaware River and Bay Authority.

It has been noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to deterioration than are the asphalt roadways in almost the rest of the state. Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.

===Ferries===

Three ferries operate in the state of Delaware:
* Cape May–Lewes Ferry crosses the mouth of Delaware Bay between Lewes, Delaware and Cape May, New Jersey.
* Woodland Ferry (a cable ferry) crosses the Nanticoke River southwest of Seaford.
* Forts Ferry Crossing connects Delaware City with Fort Delaware and Fort Mott, New Jersey.

===Rail and bus===
Amtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor; the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark, and the busier Wilmington Station in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA&#x27;s Wilmington/Newark Line, part of SEPTA Regional Rail, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing, and Newark.

Two Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. Norfolk Southern provides freight service along the Northeast Corridor and to industrial areas in Edgemoor, New Castle, and Delaware City. CSX&#x27;s Philadelphia Subdivision passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Multiple short-line railroads provide freight service in Delaware. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in Porter south through Dover, Harrington, and Seaford to Delmar, with another line running from Harrington to Frankford and branches from Ellendale to Milton and from Georgetown to Gravel Hill. The Delmarva Central Railroad connects with the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which serves local customers in Sussex County. CSX connects with the freight/heritage operation, the Wilmington and Western Railroad, based in Wilmington and the East Penn Railroad, which operates a line from Wilmington to Coatesville, Pennsylvania.

The last north–south passenger trains through the main part of Delaware was the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s local Wilmington-Delmar train in 1965. This was a successor to the &quot;Del-Mar-Va Express&quot; and &quot;Cavalier&quot;, which had run from Philadelphia through the state&#x27;s interior, to the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s.

The DART First State public transportation system was named &quot;Most Outstanding Public Transportation System&quot; in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as &quot;the most generous paratransit system in the United States&quot;. , fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.

===Air===
, Delaware is served exclusively by Avelo Airlines out of Wilmington Airport, launching five routes to Florida on February 1. This put an end to an eight-month period during which Delaware had no scheduled air service, one of several since 1991. Various airlines had served Wilmington Airport, the latest departure being Frontier Airlines in June 2022.

Delaware is centrally situated in the Northeast megalopolis region of cities along I-95. Therefore, Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY), as it is located less than from the Delaware border. Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) are also within a radius of New Castle County.

Other general aviation airports in Delaware include Summit Airport near Middletown, Delaware Airpark near Cheswold, and Delaware Coastal Airport near Georgetown.

Dover Air Force Base, one of the largest in the country, is home to the 436th Airlift Wing and the 512th Airlift Wing. In addition to its other responsibilities in the Air Mobility Command, it serves as the entry point and mortuary for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.

==Law and government==
Delaware&#x27;s fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.

===Legislative branch===

The Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senate with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.

Delaware&#x27;s U.S. Senators are Lisa Blunt Rochester (Democrat) and Chris Coons (Democrat). Delaware&#x27;s single U.S. Representative is Sarah McBride (Democrat).

===Judicial branch===
The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:
* The Delaware Supreme Court is the state&#x27;s highest court.
* The Delaware Superior Court is the state&#x27;s trial court of general jurisdiction.
* The Delaware Court of Chancery deals primarily in corporate disputes.
* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.
* The Delaware Court of Common Pleas has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.

Minor non-constitutional courts include the Justice of the Peace Courts and Aldermen&#x27;s Courts.

Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the Courts&#x27; opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Delaware was the last U.S. state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952.

===Executive branch===
The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The current governor is Matt Meyer (Democrat), who took office January 21, 2025. The lieutenant governor is Kyle Evans Gay. The governor presents a &quot;State of the State&quot; speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually.

The executive branch also consists of the Attorney General of Delaware currently held by Kathy Jennings, the State Treasurer currently held by Colleen Davis, the Auditor of Accounts currently held by Lydia York and the Insurance Commissioner currently held by Trinidad Navarro.

===Counties===

Delaware is subdivided into three counties; from north to south they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.

===Politics===
The Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations in Delaware. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware, as well as majorities in the state Senate and House. The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won any statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer.

During the First and Second Party Systems, Delaware was a stronghold for the Federalist and Whig Parties, respectively. After a relatively brief adherence to the Democratic Solid South following the US Civil War, Delaware became a Republican-leaning state from 1896 through 1948, voting for losing Republicans Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, Herbert Hoover in 1932, and Thomas Dewey in 1948.

During the second half of the 20th century, Delaware was a bellwether state, voting for the winner of every presidential election from 1952 through 1996. Delaware&#x27;s bellwether status came to an end when Delaware voted for Al Gore in 2000 by 13%. Subsequent elections have continued to demonstrate Delaware&#x27;s current strong Democratic lean: John Kerry carried the First State by 8% in 2004; Barack Obama carried it by 25% and by 19% in his two elections of 2008 and 2012; and Hillary Clinton carried it by 11% as she lost the Electoral College in 2016. In 2020, Delaware native (and Barack Obama&#x27;s former vice president and running mate) Joe Biden headed the Democratic ticket; he carried his home state by just shy of 19% en route to a national 4.5% win.

The dominant factor in Delaware&#x27;s political shift has been the strong Democratic trend in heavily urbanized New Castle County, home to 55% of Delaware&#x27;s population. New Castle County has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988, and has given Democrats over 60% of its vote in every election from 2004 on. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle County, which was a large enough margin to tip the state to the Democrats. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the state legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle County.

In a 2020 study, Delaware was ranked as the 18th hardest state for citizens to vote in.

===Freedom of information===
Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government. In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce. A bill aimed at restricting Freedom of Information Act requests, Senate Bill 155, was discussed in committee.

===Taxation===

Tax is collected by the Delaware Division of Revenue.

Delaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.

Delaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county property taxes, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.

Gambling provides significant revenue to the state. For instance, the casino at Delaware Park Racetrack provided more than $100million to the state in 2010.

In June 2018, Delaware became the first U.S. state to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA).

;Professional teams
As Delaware has no franchises in the major American professional sports leagues, many Delawareans follow either Philadelphia or Baltimore teams. In the WNBA, the Washington Mystics enjoy a major following due to the presence of Wilmington native and University of Delaware product Elena Delle Donne. The University of Delaware&#x27;s football team has a large following throughout the state, with the Delaware State University and Wesley College teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.

Delaware is home to Dover Motor Speedway and Bally&#x27;s Dover. Dover Motor Speedway, also known as the &quot;Monster Mile&quot;, is one of only 10 tracks in the nation to have hosted 100 or more NASCAR Cup Series races. Bally&#x27;s Dover is a popular harness racing facility. It is the only co-located horse- and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Bally&#x27;s Dover track located inside the Dover Motor Speedway track.

Delaware is represented in rugby by the Delaware Black Foxes, a 2015 expansion club.

Delaware has been home to professional wrestling outfit Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). CZW has been affiliated with the annual Tournament of Death and ECWA with its annual Super8 Tournament.

Delaware&#x27;s official state sport is bicycling.

==Foreign affairs==

=== Sister state ===
Delaware has had a foreign sister state in Japan, named Miyagi Prefecture. These two have shared relations since 1997, and have had exchange programs available for students that were briefly paused in wake of the earthquake and the tsunami that ensued in the prefecture during March 2011.

== Delawareans ==

Prominent Delawareans include the du Pont family of politicians and businesspersons, and the 46th president of the United States Joe Biden. Biden’s family moved to Delaware during his childhood, and he later represented Delaware for 36 years in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009, before being 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

<doc id="7931" wikidata="Q23622" url="?curid=7931" title="Dictionary">
<text>A dictionary is a listing of lexemes from the lexicon of one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by consonantal root for Semitic languages or radical and stroke for logographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.

A broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a comprehensive range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.

There is also a contrast between &quot;prescriptive&quot; or &quot;descriptive&quot; dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. &quot;informal&quot; or &quot;vulgar&quot;) in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.

The first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times around 2300 BCE, in the form of bilingual dictionaries, and the oldest surviving monolingual dictionaries are Chinese dictionaries . The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was &quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot;, written in 1604, and monolingual dictionaries in other languages also began appearing in Europe at around this time. The systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest arose as a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, with the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of having an &quot;astonishing lack of method and critical self-reflection&quot;.

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian–Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated to roughly 2300 BCE, the time of the Akkadian Empire. The early 2nd millennium BCE &quot;Urra=hubullu&quot; glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the &quot;Erya&quot;, is the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; and some sources cite the &quot;Shizhoupian&quot; (probably compiled sometime between 700 BCE to 200 BCE, possibly earlier) as a &quot;dictionary&quot;, although modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary &quot;Disorderly Words&quot; (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, &quot;&quot;) which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarakośa, was written by Amarasimha . Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the , the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE &quot;Niina&quot; glossary of Chinese characters. Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi&#x27;s 8th century &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Ayn&quot; is considered the first dictionary of Arabic. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the &quot;Tenrei Banshō Meigi&quot;, was also a glossary of written Chinese. In &quot;Frahang-i Pahlavig&quot;, Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in the Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in the Pazend alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In the 12th century, The Karakhanid-Turkic scholar Mahmud Kashgari finished his work &quot;Divan-u Lügat&#x27;it Türk&quot;, a dictionary about the Turkic dialects, but especially Karakhanid Turkic. His work contains about 7500 to 8000 words and it was written to teach non Turkic Muslims, especially the Abbasid Arabs, the Turkic language. Al-Zamakhshari wrote a small Arabic dictionary called &quot;Muḳaddimetü&#x27;l-edeb&quot; for the Turkic-Khwarazm ruler Atsiz. In the 14th century, the Codex Cumanicus was finished and it served as a dictionary about the Cuman-Turkic language. While in Mamluk Egypt, Ebû Hayyân el-Endelüsî finished his work &quot;Kitâbü&#x27;l-İdrâk li-lisâni&#x27;l-Etrâk&quot;, a dictionary about the Kipchak and Turcoman languages spoken in Egypt and the Levant. A dictionary called &quot;Bahşayiş Lügati&quot;, which is written in old Anatolian Turkish, served also as a dictionary between Oghuz Turkish, Arabic and Persian. But it is not clear who wrote the dictionary or in which century exactly it was published. It was written in old Anatolian Turkish from the Seljuk period and not the late medieval Ottoman period. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari, which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.

Arabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur&#x27;an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the &quot;Lisan al-`Arab&quot; (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and &quot;al-Qamus al-Muhit&quot; (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The &quot;Qamus al-Muhit&quot; is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the &quot;Lisan&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
In medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The &quot;Catholicon&quot; (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino&#x27;s &quot;Dictionarium&quot; was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the &quot;Thesaurus linguae latinae&quot; and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the &quot;Thesaurus linguae graecae&quot;, which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual Spanish dictionary written was Sebastián Covarrubias&#x27;s &quot;Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española&quot;, published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the &quot;Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca&quot;, for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the &quot;Dictionnaire Universel&quot; by Antoine Furetière for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the (still published, with the ninth edition not complete ). Between 1712 and 1721 was published the &quot;Vocabulario portughez e latino&quot; written by Raphael Bluteau. The Royal Spanish Academy published the first edition of the (still published, with a new edition about every decade) in 1780; their &quot;Diccionario de Autoridades&quot;, which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The &quot;Totius Latinitatis lexicon&quot; by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.

The first edition of &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot; by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches Wörterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the &quot;Dizionario della lingua italiana&quot; by Niccolò Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of &quot;A magyar nyelv szótára&quot; (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. Émile Littré published the between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the &quot;Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal&quot; which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the &quot;Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language&quot;. The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordbok&quot; was taken in 1787.

===English dictionaries in Britain===

The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word &quot;dictionary&quot; was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220 he had written a book &quot;Dictionarius&quot; to help with Latin &quot;diction&quot;. An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the &quot;Elementarie&quot;, created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was &quot;A Table Alphabeticall&quot;, written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey&#x27;s publication, that it is &quot;a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.&quot;

In 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his &quot;English Expositor&quot;. &quot;Glossographia&quot; by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled &quot;The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary&quot; which boldly plagiarized Blount&#x27;s work, and the two criticised each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins&#x27; 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his &quot;English Dictionary&quot; in 1676.

It was not until Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson&#x27;s masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first &quot;modern&quot; dictionary.

Johnson&#x27;s dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in short from 1884 onwards. A complete ten-volume first edition was not released until 1928. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, William Chester Minor, a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.

The OED remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months.

===American English dictionaries===
In 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, &quot;&quot;. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, &quot;An American Dictionary of the English Language;&quot; it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced spellings that became American English, replacing &quot;colour&quot; with &quot;color&quot;, substituting &quot;wagon&quot; for &quot;waggon&quot;, and printing &quot;center&quot; instead of &quot;centre&quot;. He also added American words, like &quot;skunk&quot; and &quot;squash&quot;, which did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. Webster&#x27;s dictionary was acquired by G &amp; C Merriam Co. in 1843, after his death, and has since been published in many revised editions. Merriam-Webster was acquired by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1964.

Controversy over the lack of usage advice in the 1961 &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; spurred publication of the 1969 &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, the first dictionary to use corpus linguistics.

==Types==

In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.

===Specialized dictionaries===

According to the &quot;Manual of Specialized Lexicographies&quot;, a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field, as opposed to a dictionary that comprehensively contains words from the lexicon of a specific language or languages. Following the description in &quot;The Bilingual LSP Dictionary&quot;, lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between &quot;minimizing dictionaries&quot; and &quot;maximizing dictionaries&quot;, multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, &quot;Oxford Dictionary of World Religions&quot; and &quot;Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms&quot;) whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology&quot;).

Another variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).

===Defining dictionaries===
The simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.

===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: &quot;prescriptive&quot; or &quot;descriptive&quot;. Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling &quot;color&quot; while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers &quot;colour&quot;. (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)

Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) and &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot; are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word&#x27;s definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, provide information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, &quot;sometimes offensive&quot; or &quot;stand&quot; (nonstandard). &quot;American Heritage&quot; goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous &quot;usage notes.&quot; &quot;Encarta&quot; provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, &quot;an offensive term for...&quot; or &quot;a taboo term meaning...&quot;.

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to &quot;El otro, el mismo&quot;: &quot;It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.&quot;

Sometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, the &quot;Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary&quot; is &quot;at war with itself&quot;: whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as &quot;hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít&quot; (she&#x27;ll tear me apart when she sees what I&#x27;ve done to the car). Whereas &quot;hi taharóg otí&quot;, literally &#x27;she will kill me&#x27;, is colloquial, &quot;me&quot; (a variant of &quot;ma&quot; &#x27;what&#x27;) is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.

=== Historical dictionaries ===
A historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.

===Dictionaries for natural language processing===

In contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.

===Other types===

* Bilingual dictionary
* Collegiate dictionary (American)
* Learner&#x27;s dictionary (mostly British)
* Electronic dictionary
* Encyclopedic dictionary
* Monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionary
** Advanced learner&#x27;s dictionary
* By sound
** Rhyming dictionary
* Reverse dictionary (Conceptual dictionary)
* Visual dictionary
* Satirical dictionary
* Phonetic dictionary

==Pronunciation==

In many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word &quot;dictionary&quot; might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling (in British English) or (in American English). American English dictionaries often use their own pronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example &quot;dictionary&quot; is respelled as &quot;dĭk′shə-nĕr′ē&quot; in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, &quot;dictionary&quot; may be respelled as . Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.

==Online dictionaries==

The age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that &quot;Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are &quot;holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric&quot; and &quot;bourgeois.&quot; Teaching users about words they don&#x27;t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well.&quot;

There exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of neologisms. Some of the more notable examples are given in List of online dictionaries and :Category:Online dictionaries.

<text>David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and anarcho-capitalist theorist. Although his academic training was in chemistry and physics and not law or economics, he is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot;. Described by Walter Block as a &quot;free-market anarchist&quot; theorist, Friedman has also authored several other books and articles, including &quot;Price Theory: An Intermediate Text&quot; (1986), &quot;Law&#x27;s Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters&quot; (2000), &quot;Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life&quot; (1996), and &quot;Future Imperfect&quot; (2008).

==Life and work==
David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and physics. He later earned a master&#x27;s (1967) and a PhD (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago. Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law. He was a professor of law at Santa Clara University from 2005 to 2017, and a contributing editor for &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. He is currently a Professor Emeritus. He is an atheist. His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.

===&quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot;===

In his book &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot; (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.

He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for it on a cost–benefit analysis of state versus no state. It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.

==Non-academic interests==
Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as &quot;Duke Cariadoc of the Bow&quot;. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East. His work is compiled in the popular &quot;Cariadoc&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge and lost (to himself).

He was a teenage wargamer who taught his school friend, Jack Radey, founder of People&#x27;s War Games, how to play such wargames as &quot;Tactics II&quot;. Radey relates how Friedman and himself wrote to Charles S. Roberts claiming that they had found a first turn winning strategy for each of the two sides. Roberts replied that their interpretation of the rules was valid.

He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written three novels. &quot;Harald&quot; (Baen Books, 2006) is set in an invented world drawn from European history.
&quot;Salamander&quot; (2011) and its sequel &quot;Brothers&quot; (2020) are fantasy.

He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.

<doc id="7938" wikidata="Q1751859" url="?curid=7938" title="Diatomic molecule">
<text>Diatomic molecules () are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements. If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen () or oxygen (), then it is said to be homonuclear. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide () or nitric oxide (), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar.

The only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or at typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25 °C) are the gases hydrogen (), nitrogen (), oxygen (), fluorine (), and chlorine (), and the liquid bromine ().

The noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) are also gases at STP, but they are monatomic. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called &quot;elemental gases&quot; or &quot;molecular gases&quot;, to distinguish them from other gases that are chemical compounds.

At slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens bromine () and iodine () also form diatomic gases. All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for astatine and tennessine, which are uncertain.

Other elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating (&quot;cracking&quot;) elemental phosphorus gives diphosphorus (). Sulfur vapor is mostly disulfur (). Dilithium () and disodium () are known in the gas phase. Ditungsten () and dimolybdenum () form with sextuple bonds in the gas phase. Dirubidium () is diatomic.

== Heteronuclear molecules ==
All other diatomic molecules are chemical compounds of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form heteronuclear diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.

Examples are gases carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen chloride (HCl).

Many 1:1 binary compounds are not normally considered diatomic because they are polymeric at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.

== Occurrence ==
Hundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in interstellar space. About 99% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of hydrogen (H2) in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H2 is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is dominated by hydrogen atoms.

== Molecular geometry ==
All diatomic molecules are linear and characterized by a single parameter which is the bond length or distance between the two atoms. Diatomic nitrogen has a triple bond, diatomic oxygen has a double bond, and diatomic hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine all have single bonds.

== Historical significance ==
Diatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. John Dalton&#x27;s original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water&#x27;s formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.

As early as 1805, Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water&#x27;s composition, based on what is now called Avogadro&#x27;s law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro&#x27;s law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.

At the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress on atomic weights, Cannizzaro resurrected Avogadro&#x27;s ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the periodic law by Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer.

== Excited electronic states ==
Diatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the formula_1 state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments. Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is metastable), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a photon is emitted. This emission is known as fluorescence. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.

In quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by the molecular term symbol
: formula_5
where formula_6 is the total electronic spin quantum number, formula_7 is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and formula_8 is the vibrational quantum number. formula_7 takes on values 0, 1, 2, ..., which are represented by the electronic state symbols formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, ...
For example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (formula_13) of diatomic nitrogen (N2), the most abundant gas in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. 

The subscripts and superscripts after formula_7 give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state. The superscript formula_15 or formula_16 determines whether reflection in a plane containing the internuclear axis introduces a sign change in the wavefunction. The sub-script formula_17 or formula_18 applies to molecules of identical atoms, and when reflecting the state along a plane perpendicular to the molecular axis, states that does not change are labelled formula_17 (gerade), and states that change sign are labelled formula_18 (ungerade).


The aforementioned fluorescence occurs in distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, called &quot;emission bands&quot;: each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N2 formula_2-formula_1 emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 μm (micrometres). A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule&#x27;s rotational quantum number, formula_23. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in formula_23. The formula_25 branch corresponds to formula_26, the formula_27 branch to formula_28, and the formula_29 branch to formula_30. Bands are spread out even further by the limited spectral resolution of the spectrometer that is used to measure the spectrum. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument&#x27;s point spread function.

== Energy levels ==
The molecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also eigenstates of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. The theoretical study of the rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecules can be described using the below description of the rotational energy levels. While the study of vibrational energy level of the diatomic molecules can be described using the harmonic oscillator approximation or using the quantum vibrational interaction potentials. These potentials give more accurate energy levels because they take multiple vibrational effects into account.

Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926.

=== Translational energies ===
The translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression:
: formula_31
where formula_32 is the mass of the molecule and formula_8 is its velocity.

=== Rotational energies ===
Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is
: formula_34
where
: formula_35 is the angular momentum
: formula_36 is the moment of inertia of the molecule

For microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by
: formula_37
where formula_38 is a non-negative integer and formula_39 is the reduced Planck constant.

Also, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is
: formula_40
where
: formula_41 is the reduced mass of the molecule and
: formula_42 is the average distance between the centers of the two atoms in the molecule.

So, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into Erot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:
: formula_43

=== Vibrational energies ===
Another type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate—or vibrate—along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a quantum harmonic oscillator:
: formula_44
where
: formula_45 is an integer
: formula_39 is the reduced Planck constant and
: formula_47 is the angular frequency of the vibration.

=== Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings ===
The spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between rotational energy levels.

== Hund&#x27;s cases==

The good quantum numbers for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using Hund&#x27;s cases.

== Mnemonics ==
The mnemonics &quot;BrINClHOF&quot;, pronounced &quot;Brinklehof&quot;, &quot;HONClBrIF&quot;, pronounced &quot;Honkelbrif&quot;, “HOBrFINCl”, pronounced “Hoberfinkel”, and &quot;HOFBrINCl&quot;, pronounced &quot;Hofbrinkle&quot;, have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements. Another method, for English-speakers, is the sentence: &quot;Never Have Fear of Ice Cold Beer&quot; as a representation of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Oxygen, Iodine, Chlorine, Bromine.

<text>A duopoly (from Greek , ; and , ) is a type of oligopoly where two firms have dominant or exclusive control over a market, and most (if not all) of the competition within that market occurs directly between them.

Duopoly is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopolies sell to consumers in a competitive market where the choice of an individual consumer choice cannot affect the firm in a duopoly market, as the defining characteristic of duopolies is that decisions made by each seller are dependent on what the other competitor does. Duopolies can exist in various forms, such as Cournot, Bertrand, or Stackelberg competition. These models demonstrate how firms in a duopoly can compete on output or price, depending on the assumptions made about firm behavior and market conditions.

Similar features are discernible in national political systems of party duopoly.

==Duopoly models in economics and game theory==

===Cournot duopoly=== 
====Cournot model in game theory====
In 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot published a book titled &quot;Researches Into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth&quot; in which he introduced and developed this model for the first time. As an imperfect competition model, Cournot duopoly (also known as Cournot competition), in which two firms with identical cost functions compete with homogenous products in a static context, is also known as Cournot competition. The Cournot model, shows that two firms assume each other&#x27;s output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this. The Cournot duopoly model relies on the following assumptions:

* Each firm chooses a quantity to produce independently
* All firms make this choice simultaneously
* The cost structures of the firms are public information

In this model, two companies, each of which chooses its own quantity of output, compete against each other while facing constant marginal and average costs. The market price is determined by the sum of the output of two companies. formula_1 is the equation for the market demand function.

* Market with two firms with constant marginal cost 
* Inverse market demand for a homogeneous good: 
* Where is the sum of both firms&#x27; production levels: 
* Firms choose their quantity simultaneously (static game)
* Firms maximize their profit: 
formula_2

The general process for obtaining a Nash equilibrium of a game using the best response functions is followed in order to discover a Nash equilibrium of Cournot&#x27;s model for a specific cost function and demand function. A Nash Equilibrium of the Cournot model is a such that

For a given formula_3 solves:

formula_4

Given the other firm&#x27;s optimal quantity, each firm maximizes its profit over the residual inverse demand. In equilibrium, no firm can increase profits by changing its output level Two first order conditions equal to zero are the best response.

Cournot&#x27;s duopoly marked the beginning of the study of oligopolies, and specifically duopolies, as well as the expansion of the research of market structures, which had previously focussed on the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. In the Cournot duopoly model, firms choose the quantity of output they produce simultaneously, taking into consideration the quantity produced by their competitor. Each firm&#x27;s profit depends on the total output produced by both firms, and the market price is determined by the sum of their outputs. The goal of each firm is to maximize its profit given the output produced by the other firm. This process continues until both firms reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its output level given the output of the other firm.

===Bertrand duopoly===
====Bertrand model in game theory====

The Bertrand competition was developed by a French mathematician called Joseph Louis François Bertrand after investigating the claims of the Cournot model in &quot;Researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth, 1838&quot;. According to the Cournot model, firms in a duopoly would be able to keep prices above marginal cost and hence be extremely profitable. Bertrand took issue with this. In this market structure, each firm could only choose whole amounts and each firm receives zero payoffs when the aggregate demand exceeds the size of the amount that they share with each other. The market demand function is formula_5. The Bertrand model has similar assumptions to the Cournot model:

* Two firms
* Homogeneous products
* Both firms know the market demand curve
* However, unlike the Cournot model, it assumes that firms have the same MC. It also assumes that the MC is constant.

The Bertrand model, in which, in a game of two firms, competes in price instead of output. Each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium.

* Consider price competition among two firms () selling homogeneous good
* Downward sloping market demand , with 
* Constant, symmetric marginal cost 
* Static game: firms set prices simultaneously
* Rationing rule of demand:

# lowest priced firm wins all demand at its price
# if prices are tied, each firm gets half of market demand at this price

* Firm ″s profits: formula_6

Let be the monopoly price, formula_7

* Firm ″s best response is:

formula_8

For rival prices above cost, each firm has incentive to undercut rival to get the whole demand. If rival prices below cost, firms make losses when it attracts demand; firm better off charging at cost level. Nash equilibrium is .

====Bertrand paradox====
Under static price competition with homogenous products and constant, symmetric marginal cost, firms price at the level of marginal cost and make no economic profits. In contrast to the Cournot model, the Bertrand duopoly model assumes that firms compete on price rather than quantity. Each firm sets its price simultaneously, anticipating that the other firm will not change its price in response. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its price given the price set by the other firm. In this model, firms tend to price their products at the level of their marginal cost, resulting in zero economic profits, a phenomenon known as the Bertrand paradox.

== Characteristics of duopoly ==

# Existence of only two sellers.
# Interdependence: the action of each firm influences the demand faced by their rival.
# Presence of monopoly elements: as long as products are differentiated, the firms enjoy some monopoly power, as each product will have some loyal customers.
# It is the most basic form of oligopoly
# Barriers to entry: high entry barriers are often present in duopolies, making it difficult for new firms to enter the market.

== Quality standards ==
In a duopoly, quality standards can play a significant role in the competitive dynamics between the two firms. A low-quality manufacturer may benefit from a slightly stringent quality standard in the absence of sunk costs, whereas a high-quality producer may suffer from it. Consumer welfare improves if the firm generating the higher quality does not considerably enhance its quality in response to its competitor&#x27;s increase in quality. Exit from the industry is triggered by a sufficiently strict requirement. The high-quality producer exits first when there are no sunk costs. In some cases, firms may engage in a quality competition, attempting to outdo one another by improving their products or services to attract more customers.

==Politics==

Like a market, a political system can be dominated by two groups, which exclude other parties or ideologies from participation. This is known as a two-party system. In such a system, one party or the other tends to dominate government at any given time (the Majority party), while the other has only limited power (the Minority party). According to Duverger&#x27;s law, this tends to be caused by a simple winner-take-all voting system without runoffs or ranked choices. The United States and many Latin American countries, such as Costa Rica, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic have two-party government systems.

===Duopoly in Danish court politics===

The prime minister-finance minister duopoly is an unusual form of court politics. There have been few other countries where the prime minister and the Treasury have had such a tumultuous relationship as Australia and the United Kingdom. There have been some confrontations in the past when the Finance ministry did not have the full support of the prime minister, leading to internal ministerial battles over economic strategy. A permanent civil service is a basic requirement for the duopoly system to function properly. The permanent civil service in general, and the Socialist Party in particular, are critical to the duopoly&#x27;s effective operation. The conventional inter-governmental duopoly is carried by civil servants. The duopoly is confronted with some quandaries, such as tensions between different groups in the office over their relative positions. Departmental budget cuts are being made across the board. The prime ministerial-finance-ministry duopoly requires more credibility. Trust is a rare commodity among Australians and Britons. Denmark has a lot to offer. The Danish duopoly works together. Australia and the United Kingdom have competitive duopolies, and competitive duopolies are unstable.

== Types of duopoly ==
=== Cournot duopoly ===
A Cournot duopoly is a model of strategic interaction between two firms where they simultaneously choose their output levels, assuming the rival&#x27;s output level is fixed. The firms compete on quantity, and each firm attempts to maximize its profit given the other firm&#x27;s output level. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where neither firm has an incentive to change its output, given the other firm&#x27;s output.

=== Bertrand duopoly ===
In a Bertrand duopoly, two firms compete on price instead of quantity. Each firm assumes that its rival&#x27;s price is fixed and chooses its own price to maximize profit. This model predicts that, under certain conditions, firms will set prices equal to marginal cost, leading to perfect competition.

=== Stackelberg duopoly ===
A Stackelberg duopoly is a model where one firm (the leader) chooses its output level first, followed by the other firm (the follower). The follower observes the leader&#x27;s output decision and adjusts its own output to maximize profit. The Stackelberg model often results in a higher total output and lower market price than the Cournot and Bertrand models.

==Examples in business==

A commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving Visa and Mastercard, who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a United States Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. An appeal was upheld in 2004.

Examples where two companies control an overwhelming proportion of a market are:

* Airbus and Boeing in the largest commercial aircraft market in the world
* Nvidia (who acquired competitor 3dfx in 2002) and AMD (formerly ATI which AMD acquired in 2006) in the GPU market
* Intel and AMD in the desktop CPU market
* Google&#x27;s Android and Apple&#x27;s iOS make up over 99% of the mobile operating system market
* Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the soft drink market, resulting in the cola wars. The two companies control nearly all of the cola beverage market.
* DC and Marvel in the American comic book market and movies
* Woolworths and Coles in the Australian supermarket market
* Myer and David Jones in the Australian upmarket department store market
* Husqvarna and Stihl in the chainsaw market
* Windows and macOS in the desktop operating system (OS) market.
* Kesko and S Group together hold a 85% market share of grocery stores in Finland.

==Media==
In Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company Yleisradio and the private broadcaster Mainos-TV had a legal duopoly (in the economists&#x27; sense of the word) from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradio&#x27;s own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and M-TV; only in 1993 did M-TV get its own channel.

In Kenya, mobile service providers Safaricom and Airtel in Kenya form a duopoly in the Kenyan telecommunications industry.

In Singapore, the mass media industry is presently dominated by two players, namely Mediacorp and SPH Media Trust.

In the United Kingdom, the BBC and ITV formed an effective duopoly (with Channel 4 originally being economically dependent on ITV) until the development of multichannel from the 1990s onwards.

==Broadcasting==

Duopoly is used in the United States broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city. This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and may lead to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In Canada, this definition is therefore more commonly called a &quot;twinstick&quot;.

<doc id="7940" wikidata="Q1375" url="?curid=7940" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">
<text>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&amp;D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) originally created and designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast, later a subsidiary of Hasbro, since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game &quot;Chainmail&quot; serving as the initial rule system. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, which also deeply influenced video games, especially the role-playing video game genre.

&quot;D&amp;D&quot; departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as referee and storyteller for the game, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, known as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting&#x27;s inhabitants and each other. Together they solve problems, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, player characters earn experience points (XP) to level up, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions. Players choose a class when they create their character, which gives them special perks and abilities every few levels.

The early success of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite the competition, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; has remained the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;). &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.

In 2004, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide. The year 2017 had &quot;the most number of players in its history—12 million to 15 million in North America alone&quot;. &quot;D&amp;D 5th edition&quot; sales &quot;were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game&#x27;s biggest sales year yet&quot;. The game has been supplemented by many premade adventures, as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is known beyond the game itself for other &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-branded products, references in popular culture, and some of the controversies that have surrounded it, particularly a moral panic in the 1980s that attempted to associate it with Satanism and suicide. The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.

==Play overview==

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a &quot;party&quot; of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics, and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a &quot;campaign&quot;.

The results of the party&#x27;s choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM&#x27;s interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players&#x27; choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with &quot;monsters&quot; – a generic term used in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. In addition to jewels and gold coins, magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon. Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest. The game&#x27;s extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.

The most recent versions of the game&#x27;s rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks: The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures, and various campaign settings.

===Game mechanics===

Before the game begins, each player creates their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character&#x27;s ability scores, which consist of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these scores. The player then chooses a species (such as a dwarf, elf, or human – called &quot;race&quot; prior to 5e 2024), a character class (such as a fighter, rogue, or wizard), an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character&#x27;s abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.

During the game, players describe their PCs&#x27; intended actions to the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions, such as scaling a cliff or picking a lock, are determined by rolling dice. Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions. For example, a twenty-sided die is used to determine whether a hit is made in combat, with other dice such as four, six, eight, ten, or even twelve-sided die used to determine how much damage was dealt. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character&#x27;s ability scores, skills, and the difficulty of the task. In circumstances where a character is attempting to avoid a negative outcome, such as when dodging a trap or resisting the effect of a spell, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting effect is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character&#x27;s class, levels and ability scores. In circumstances where a character is attempting to complete a task such as picking a lock, deactivating a trap, or pushing a boulder, a Difficulty Class must be hit or exceeded. Relevant ability bonuses are added to help players succeed.

As the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes, which is called &quot;Multiclassing&quot;. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.

Hit points (HP) are a measure of a character&#x27;s vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and Constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.

===Adventures and campaigns===
A typical &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game consists of an &quot;adventure&quot;, which is roughly equivalent to a single story or quest. The DM can either design an original adventure or follow one of the many premade adventures (also known as &quot;modules&quot;) that have been published throughout the history of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps, and goals for players to achieve. Some may include location descriptions and handouts, although they are not required for gameplay. Although a small adventure entitled &quot;Temple of the Frog&quot; was included in the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone &quot;D&amp;D&quot; module published by TSR was 1978&#x27;s &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot;, written by Gygax.

A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a &quot;campaign&quot;. The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet, or entire fictional universe, are referred to as &quot;campaign settings&quot; or &quot;worlds.&quot; &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published campaign settings for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; include &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Mystara&quot;, &quot;Spelljammer&quot;, &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, &quot;Dark Sun&quot;, &quot;Planescape&quot;, &quot;Birthright&quot;, and &quot;Eberron&quot;.

In addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, was released in May 2019. A campaign based on the &quot;Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons&quot; comic book series was later released in November 2019.

Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings, either planning the adventure ahead or expanding on it as the players progress.

===Miniature figures===


The wargames from which &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; set of 1974 required the use of the &quot;Chainmail&quot; miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus, miniatures were no longer required for gameplay, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.

In the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include Grenadier Miniatures (1980–1983), Citadel Miniatures (1984–1986), Ral Partha, and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25 mm scale.

Periodically, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as &quot;Battlesystem&quot; (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of &quot;Chainmail&quot; (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.

==Development history==

===Sources and influences===
An immediate predecessor of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by Gary Gygax, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as &quot;Chainmail&quot;. When Dave Wesely entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer Dave Arneson began a medieval variation of Wesely&#x27;s Braunstein games, where players control individuals instead of armies. Arneson used &quot;Chainmail&quot; to resolve combat. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others. Having partnered previously with Gygax on &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship!&quot;, Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing &quot;The Fantasy Game&quot;, the game that became &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax. The name was chosen by Gygax&#x27;s two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, &quot;Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons &amp; Dragons best!&quot;, although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his then wife Mary Jo.

Many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role-playing can be seen in improvisational theater. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in Glorantha&#x27;s board games, among others. Ultimately, however, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; represents a unique blending of these elements.

The world of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; was influenced by world mythology, history, pulp fiction, and contemporary fantasy novels, as listed by Gygax in the Appendix N of the original &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;. The importance of Tolkien&#x27;s works &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as an influence on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is controversial. The presence in the game of halflings, elves, half-elves, dwarves, orcs, rangers, and the like, as well as the convention of diverse adventurers forming a group, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to &#x27;halfling&#x27;, ent to &#x27;treant&#x27;, and balrog to &#x27;balor&#x27;. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game. However, in an interview in 2000, he acknowledged that Tolkien&#x27;s work had a &quot;strong impact&quot; though he also said that the list of other influential authors was long.

The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; stories and novels of Jack Vance. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into &#x27;Law&#x27;, &#x27;Neutrality&#x27; and &#x27;Chaos&#x27;) was derived from the novel &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; by Poul Anderson. A troll described in this work influenced the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; definition of that monster. Writer and game designer Graeme Davis saw the Labyrinth of the Greek myth of the Minotaur as an inspiration for the game&#x27;s use of dungeons as monster lairs.

Other influences include the works of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, A. Merritt, H. P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, Fletcher Pratt, Roger Zelazny, and Michael Moorcock. Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;Black Destroyer&quot;, Coeurl (the Displacer Beast), Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (vorpal sword) and the Book of Genesis (the clerical spell &#x27;Blade Barrier&#x27; was inspired by the &quot;flaming sword which turned every way&quot; at the gates of Eden).

===Edition history===

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.

====Original game====

The original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, now referred to as &quot;OD&amp;D&quot;, is a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. With a very limited production budget of only $2000—with only $100 budgeted for artwork—it is amateurish in production and assumes the player is familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year, followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original &quot;Greyhawk&quot; and &quot;Blackmoor&quot; supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR&#x27;s official publications and many fanzines.

====Two-pronged strategy====

In early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide &quot;D&amp;D&quot; for nearly two decades. A &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, makes the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the &quot;Basic Set&quot; directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.

As a result of this parallel development, the basic game includes many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. John Eric Holmes, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the &quot;core rulebooks&quot;, were released: the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (PHB), the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (DMG), and the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (1985), which included a large number of new rules. Confusing matters further, the original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.

====Revised editions====

In the 1980s, the rules for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;basic&quot; &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; remained separate, each developing along different paths.

In 1981, the basic version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was revised by Tom Moldvay to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; tone, whereas &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; was promoted as an advancement of the mechanics. An accompanying &quot;Expert Set&quot;, originally written by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, allows players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by Frank Mentzer were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by &quot;Companion&quot; (1983), &quot;Master&quot; (1985), and &quot;Immortals&quot; (1986) sets. Each set covers game play for more powerful characters than the previous. The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot;, which was released alongside a new introductory boxed set.

&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition&quot; was published in 1989, again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot;, a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition, and a series of &quot;Player&#x27;s Option&quot; manuals were released as optional rulebooks.

The release of &quot;AD&amp;D 2nd Edition&quot; deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types – such as assassins and half-orcs – were removed. The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology. The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies – skill-like abilities that appear in first edition supplements. The game&#x27;s magic spells are divided into schools and spheres. A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.

====Wizards of the Coast====

In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules to date and served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5&quot; was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.

In early 2005, Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s R&amp;D team started to develop &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition, prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; playing community and a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the 3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May 2005 until its release. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition was announced at Gen Con in August 2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6, 2008. 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were restructured into &quot;Powers&quot;. These altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of options. Software tools, including player character and monster-building programs, became a major part of the game. This edition added the &quot;D&amp;D Encounters&quot; program; a weekly event held at local stores designed to draw players back to the game by giving &quot;the busy gamer the chance to play &quot;D&amp;D&quot; once a week as their schedules allow. In the past, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; games could take months, even years, and players generally had to attend every session so that the story flow wasn&#x27;t interrupted. With &quot;Encounters&quot;, players can come and go as they choose and new players can easily be integrated into the story continuity&quot;.

==== 5th Edition ====
On January 9, 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a 5th edition of the game. The company planned to take suggestions from players and let them playtest the rules. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012. At Gen Con 2012 in August, Mike Mearls, lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, &quot;I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough ... we&#x27;re very serious about taking the time we need to get this right.&quot; The release of the 5th Edition, coinciding with &quot;D&amp;D&quot;″s 40th anniversary, occurred in the second half of 2014.

Since the release of 5th edition, dozens of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; books have been published including new rulebooks, campaign guides and adventure modules. 2017 had &quot;the most number of players in its history—12 million to 15 million in North America alone&quot;. Mary Pilon, for &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, reported that sales of 5th edition &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game&#x27;s biggest sales year yet. [...] In 2017, 9 million people watched others play D&amp;D on Twitch, immersing themselves in the world of the game without ever having to pick up a die or cast a spell&quot;. In 2018, Wizards of the Coast organized a massive live-stream event, the Stream of Many Eyes, where ten live-streamed sessions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; were performed on Twitch over three days. This event won the Content Marketing Institute&#x27;s 2019 award for best &quot;In-Person (Event) Content Marketing Strategy&quot;. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; continued to have a strong presence on Twitch throughout 2019; this included a growing number of celebrity players and dungeon masters, such as Joe Manganiello, Deborah Ann Woll and Stephen Colbert. Wizards of the Coast has created, produced and sponsored multiple web series featuring &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. These shows have typically aired on the official &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Twitch and YouTube channels.

In 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; had its 6th annual year of growth in 2019 with a &quot;300 percent increase in sales of their introductory box sets, as well as a 65% increase on sales in Europe, a rate which has more than quadrupled since 2014&quot;. In terms of player demographics in 2019, 39% of identified as female and 61% identified as male. 40% of players are considered Gen Z (24 years old or younger), 34% of players are in the age range of 25–34 and 26% of players are aged 35+. In January 2021, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that according to Liz Schuh, head of publishing and licensing for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, &quot;revenue was up 35% in 2020 compared with 2019, the seventh consecutive year of growth,&quot; and in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;virtual play rose 86% [...] aided by online platforms such as Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds&quot;. Sarah Parvini, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;players and scholars attribute the game&#x27;s resurgent popularity not only to the longueurs of the pandemic, but also to its reemergence in pop culture—on the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, whose main characters play D&amp;D in a basement; on the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;; or via the host of celebrities who display their love for the game online&quot;.

Following an apology issued by Wizards of the Coast for offensive and racist material included in &quot;&quot; and the announced revisions to the product in September 2022, Christopher Perkins – Wizards&#x27; game design architect – announced a new inclusion review process for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; studio in November 2022. This process will now require &quot;every word, illustration, and map&quot; to be reviewed at several steps in development &quot;by multiple outside cultural consultants prior to publication&quot;. The previous process only included cultural consultants at the discretion of the product lead for a project. All products being reprinted will also go through this new review process and be updated as needed.

==== 2024 revision ====
In September 2021, it was announced that a backwards compatible &quot;evolution&quot; of 5th edition would be released in 2024 to mark the 50th anniversary of the game. In August 2022, Wizards announced that the next phase of major changes for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; would occur under the &quot;One D&amp;D&quot; initiative which includes a public playtest of the next version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and an upcoming virtual tabletop simulator with 3D environments developed using Unreal Engine. Revised editions of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; were scheduled to be released in 2024; the revised &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; were released in 2024, with the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; coming in 2025.

In April 2022, Hasbro announced that Wizards would acquire the D&amp;D Beyond digital toolset and game companion from Fandom; the official transfer to Wizards occurred in May 2022. At the Hasbro Investor Event in October 2022, it was announced that Dan Rawson, former COO of Microsoft Dynamics 365, was appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; brand; Rawson will act as the new head of the franchise. Chase Carter of &quot;Dicebreaker&quot; highlighted that Rawson&#x27;s role is &quot;part of Wizards&#x27; plans to apply more resources to the digital side of D&amp;D&quot; following the purchase of D&amp;D Beyond by Hasbro earlier in the year. Wizards of the Coast CEO Cynthia Williams and Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, at a December 2022 Hasbro investor-focused web seminar, called the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; brand &quot;under monetized&quot;. They highlighted the high engagement of fans with the brand, however, the majority of spending is by Dungeon Masters who are only roughly 20% of the player base. Williams commented that the increased investment in digital will &quot;unlock the type of recurrent spending you see in digital games&quot;. At the July 2024 Hasbro investor meeting, Cocks stated &quot;that digital revenue on D&amp;D Beyond &#x27;accounts for over half&#x27; of&quot; the total earnings from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Carter, now for &quot;Rascal&quot;, commented that &quot;we know physical books sell poorly, and even if pre-orders for the 2024 core books are, uh, &#x27;solid&#x27;, according to the CEO, it&#x27;s evident that Hasbro holds little faith in analog games clotting the money bleed elsewhere in the company&#x27;s structure&quot;.

== Licensing ==
Early in the game&#x27;s history, TSR took no action against small publishers&#x27; production of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; compatible material and even licensed Judges Guild to produce &quot;D&amp;D&quot; materials for several years, such as &quot;City State of the Invincible Overlord.&quot; This attitude changed in the mid-1980s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.

With the launch of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&#x27;s 3rd Edition, Wizards of the Coast made the d20 System available under the Open Game License (OGL) and d20 System trademark license. Under these licenses, authors were free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL has allowed a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative work based on the mechanics of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; to be produced since 2000; it is credited with increasing the market share of d20 products&quot;&quot; and leading to a &quot;boom in the RPG industry in the early 2000s&quot;.

With the release of the 4th Edition, Wizards of the Coast introduced its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;) who previously produced materials in support of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer &amp; Company, returned to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.

During the 2000s, there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, known as the Old School Revival. This, in turn, inspired the creation of &quot;retro-clones&quot;, games that more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.

Alongside the publication of the 5th Edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the 5th Edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons &amp; Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM&#x27;s Guild. The DM&#x27;s Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.

Wizards of the Coast has started to release 5th Edition products that tie into other intellectual properties—such as &quot;&quot; with the &quot;Guildmasters&#x27; Guide to Ravnica&quot; (2018) and &quot;Mythic Odysseys of Theros&quot; (2020) source books. Two 5th Edition starter box sets based on TV shows, &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, were released in 2019. Source books based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; live play series have also been released: &quot;Acquisitions Incorporated&quot; (2019) and &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Guide to Wildemount&quot; (2020).

Between November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning on discontinuing the OGL for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; based on unconfirmed leaks. In response to the speculation, Wizards stated in November 2022: &quot;We will continue to support the thousands of creators making third-party D&amp;D content with the release of One D&amp;D in 2024.&quot; Limited details on the update to the OGL, including the addition of revenue reporting and required royalties, were released by Wizards in December 2022. Linda Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot; in January 2023, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL1.0. Codega highlighted that &quot;if the original license is in fact no longer viable, every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand&quot;. A week after the leak, Wizards issued a response which walked back several changes to the OGL; this response did not contain the updated OGL. The Motley Fool highlighted that &quot;Hasbro pulled an abrupt volte-face and had its subsidiary D&amp;D Beyond publish a mea culpa on its website&quot;. On January 27, 2023, following feedback received during the open comment period for the draft OGL1.2, Wizards of the Coast announced that the System Reference Document 5.1 (SRD 5.1) would be released under an irrevocable Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0) effective immediately and Wizards would no longer pursue deauthorizing the OGL1.0a.

== Reception ==

Eric Goldberg reviewed &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #1 (March 1980), rating it a 6 out of 9, and commented that &quot;&quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; is an impressive achievement based on the concept alone, and also must be credited with cementing the marriage between the fantasy genre and gaming.&quot; 
Eric Goldberg again reviewed &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #3 and commented that &quot;&quot;D&amp;D&quot; is the FRP game played most often in most places.&quot; In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman asked, &quot;What can be said about a phenomenon? Aside from &quot;Tactics II&quot; and possibly &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; (the first modern tactical wargame), this is the most significant war game since H.G. Wells.&quot; However, Freeman did have significant issues with the game, pointing out, &quot;On the other hand, beginning characters are without exception dull, virtually powerless, and so fragile&quot; which was not encouraging for &quot;newcomers.&quot; He also called the magic system &quot;stupid&quot; feeling that many of the spells were &quot;redundant&quot; and &quot;the effects of the majority are hopelessly vague.&quot; He found essential elements such as saving throws, hit points, and experience points &quot;undefined or poorly explained; the ratio of substance to &quot;holes&quot; compares unfavorably with the head of a tennis racquet.&quot; He also noted the rules were &quot;presented in the most illiterate display of poor grammar, misspellings, and typographical errors in professional wargaming.&quot; Despite all these issues, Freeman concluded, &quot;As it was given birth, it is fascinating but misshapen; in its best incarnations, it&#x27;s perhaps the most exciting and attractive specimen alive.&quot;

The game had over three million players worldwide by 1981, and copies of the rules were selling at a rate of about 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a French language edition in 1982, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 1992, the game had been translated into 14 languages and sold over copies in 44 countries worldwide. By 2004, consumers had spent more than on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products and the game had been played by more than 20 million people. As many as six million people played the game in 2007. David M. Ewalt, in his book &quot;Of Dice and Men&quot; (2013), praised that the game allows for a personal fantastical experience and stated that &quot;even though it&#x27;s make-believe, the catharsis is real.&quot;

===Acclaim===

The various editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; have won many Origins Awards, including &quot;All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977&quot;, &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989&quot;, &quot;Best Roleplaying Game of 2000&quot; and &quot;Best Role Playing Game and Best Role Playing Supplement of 2014&quot; for the flagship editions of the game. Both &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions. The independent &quot;Games&quot; magazine placed &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; on their &quot;Games 100&quot; list from 1980 through 1983, then entered the game into the magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1984. &quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, saying &quot;The more players, the merrier.&quot; &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was ranked 2nd in the 1996 reader poll of &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2016 and into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2017.

=== Later editions ===
Later editions would lead to inevitable comparisons between the game series. Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2013 rated &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as #1 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying &quot;The grand-daddy of all games, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; just keeps on going, and although there might always be &#x27;edition wars&#x27; between players, that just says that it effectively stays within the consciousness of multiple generations of players as a relevant piece of entertainment.&quot; 

Griffin McElroy, for &quot;Polygon&quot; in 2014, wrote: &quot;The game has shifted in the past four decades, bouncing between different rules sets, philosophies and methods of play. Role-playing, character customization and real-life improvisational storytelling has always been at the game&#x27;s core, but how those ideas are interpreted by the game system has changed drastically edition-to-edition&quot;. Dieter Bohn, for &quot;The Verge&quot; in 2014, wrote: &quot;Every few years there&#x27;s been a new version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; that tries to address the shortcomings of the previous version and also make itself more palatable to its age. [...] The third edition got a reputation (which it didn&#x27;t necessarily deserve) for being too complex and rules-focused. The fourth edition got a reputation (which it didn&#x27;t necessarily deserve) for being too focused on miniatures and grids, too mechanical. Meanwhile, the company that owns &quot;D&amp;D&quot; had released a bunch of its old material for free as a service to fans, and some of that was built up into a competing game called &quot;Pathfinder&quot;. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; ultimately became more popular, by some metrics, than &quot;D&amp;D&quot; itself&quot;. Bohn highlighted that the 5th Edition was &quot;designed for one purpose: to bring &quot;D&amp;D&quot; back to its roots and win back everybody who left during the edition wars&quot;. Henry Glasheen, for &quot;SLUG Magazine&quot; in 2015, highlighted that after jumping ship during the 4th Edition era he was drawn back to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with 5th Edition and he considers it &quot;the new gold standard for D20-based tabletop RPGs&quot;. Glasheen wrote &quot;Fifth Edition is a compelling reason to get excited about D&amp;D again&quot; and &quot;while some will welcome the simplicity, I fully expect that plenty of people will stick to whatever system suits them best. However, this edition is easily my favorite, ranking even higher than D&amp;D 3.5, my first love in D&amp;D&quot;.

Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; in 2022, highlighted the continuing fan debate on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Pathfinder&#x27;s&quot; current editions which centers on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th Edition&#x27;s market dominance. Hoffer wrote, &quot;The reality is that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition&quot; is likely the most popular tabletop roleplaying game ever made, even more so than previous editions of the games. 5E has brought millions of new players to tabletop roleplaying games. Many of those newer players have never heard of other roleplaying games, even popular ones like &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; or &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; or &quot;Pathfinder.&quot; [...] Many content creators and publishers see 5E as their main path to survival and relevance even if it&#x27;s not their preferred gaming system&quot;. In December 2023, James Whitbrook of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; highlighted &quot;&quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s continued social influence&quot; with the release of related media such as the film &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot;, the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures&quot; FAST channel, and the video game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; with the video game&#x27;s &quot;blockbuster success&quot; credited &quot;for a 40% increase in Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s earnings over 2022&quot;. However, Whitbrook opined that not even these successes &quot;could save &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; from the greed of its owners&quot; with the OGL controversy and major layoffs by Hasbro bookending &quot;what should&#x27;ve been one of the greatest years for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; the game has ever seen—more popular than ever, more accessible than ever, more culturally relevant than ever—and in doing so transformed it into a golden era sullied with dark marks, overshadowed by grim caveats, a reflection that those with the most power in these spaces never really take the lessons they espoused to learn from their mistakes&quot;.

===Moral panic===

At various times in its history, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has received negative publicity, in particular from some Christian groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as devil worship, witchcraft, suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; manuals (mainly monsters such as harpies, succubi, etc.). These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. Many of these references, including the use of the names &quot;devils&quot; and &quot;demons&quot;, were reintroduced in the 3rd edition. The moral panic over the game led to problems for fans of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and Satanism, regardless of an individual fan&#x27;s actual religious affiliation and beliefs. However, the controversy was also beneficial in evoking the Streisand Effect by giving the game widespread notoriety that significantly increased sales in the early 1980s in defiance of the moral panic.

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; and later made into a TV movie in 1982 starring Tom Hanks. William Dear, the private investigator hired by the Egbert family to find their son when he went missing at college, wrote a book titled &quot;The Dungeon Master&quot; (1984) refuting any connection with D&amp;D and Egbert&#x27;s personal issues. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, starting with Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has also been cited as encouraging people to socialize weekly or biweekly, teaching problem solving skills, which can be beneficial in adult life, and teaching positive moral decisions.

=== Later criticism ===

&quot;D&amp;D&quot; has been compared unfavorably to other role-playing games of its time. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot; in 2008, Erik Sofge makes unfavorable comparisons between the violent incentives of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and the more versatile role-playing experience of &quot;GURPS&quot;. He claims that &quot;for decades, gamers have argued that since D&amp;D came first, its lame, morally repulsive experience system can be forgiven. But the damage is still being done: New generations of players are introduced to RPGs as little more than a collective fantasy of massacre.&quot; This criticism generated backlash from &quot;D&amp;D&quot; fans. Writing for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, Ben Kuchera responded that Sofge had experienced a &quot;small-minded Dungeon Master who only wanted to kill things&quot;, and that better game experiences are possible.

In 2020, &quot;Polygon&quot; reported that &quot;the D&amp;D team announced that it would be making changes to portions of its 5th edition product line that fans have called out for being insensitive&quot;. Sebastian Modak, for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reported that the tabletop community has widely approved these changes. Modak wrote that &quot;in its statement addressing mistakes around portrayals of different peoples in the D&amp;D universe, Wizards of the Coast highlighted its recent efforts in bringing in more diverse voices to craft the new &quot;D&amp;D&quot; sourcebooks coming out in 2021. [...] These conversations—around depictions of race and alleged treatment of employees of marginalized backgrounds and identities—have encouraged players to seek out other tabletop roleplaying experiences&quot;. Matthew Gault, for &quot;Wired&quot;, reported positively on the roundtable discussions Wizards of the Coast has hosted with fans and community leaders on diversity and inclusion. However, Gault also highlighted that other efforts, such as revisions to old material and the release of new material, have been less great and at times minimal. Gault wrote, &quot;WotC appears to be trying to change things, but it keeps stumbling, and it&#x27;s often the fans who pick up the pieces. [...] WotC is trying to make changes, but it often feels like lip service. [...] The loudest voices criticizing D&amp;D right now are doing it out of love. They don&#x27;t want to see it destroyed, they want it to change with the times&quot;. However, in 2022, academic Christopher Ferguson stated that the game &quot;was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes&quot; after he conducted a survey study of 308 adults (38.2% non-White, and 17% &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; players). Ferguson concluded that Wizards of the Coast may be responding to a moral panic similar to that surrounding Satanism in the 1990s. In the 2024 update to 5e, character &quot;race&quot; (such as dwarf, elf, or human) was changed to &quot;species.&quot;

Between November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning to discontinue the Open Game License for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; based on unconfirmed leaks. Following an initial response to the speculation by Wizards in November 2022, the company released limited details on the update to the OGL in December 2022. Linda Codega, writing for &quot;Io9&quot;, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 on January 5, 2023. Codega highlighted that &quot;every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand&quot;. &quot;ICv2&quot; commented that the leaked OGL had several controversial parts. Following this leak, numerous news and industry-focused outlets reported on negative reactions from both fans and professional content creators. &quot;TheStreet&quot; highlighted that &quot;the company&#x27;s main competitors&quot; quickly pivoted away from the OGL in the time it took Wizards to settle on a response. &quot;Starburst&quot; commented that &quot;historically when the owners of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; attempt to restrict what people can do with the game, it leads to a boom in other tabletop roleplaying games. This is happening right now&quot;. &quot;TheStreet&quot; also commented that Wizards united its &quot;entire player base&quot; against it; both &quot;TheStreet&quot; and &quot;Io9&quot; highlighted the movement to boycott D&amp;D Beyond and mass subscription cancellations with &quot;Io9&quot; stating that the &quot;immediate financial consequences&quot; forced a response by Wizards. &quot;Io9&quot; reported that Wizards&#x27; internal messaging on the response to the leak was this was a fan overreaction. In the ensuing weeks, Wizards walked back changes to the OGL and solicited public feedback before pivoting away from the OGL to release the (SRD 5.1) under an irrevocable creative commons license (CC BY 4.0). Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;pushback from fans, who criticized WotC&#x27;s response as far from an apology and a dismissal of their legitimate concerns, led WotC to backpedal further&quot; and that the company &quot;appears to have committed an irreversible act of self-sabotage in trying to replace [the OGL] — squandering the prestige accumulated over 20 years in a matter of weeks&quot;. Both &quot;Io9&quot; and &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called the major concessions – releasing the SRD 5.1 under the creative commons and no longer deauthorizing the OGL1.0a – announced by Wizards a &quot;huge victory&quot; for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; community.

== Legacy and influence ==
&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a game mechanic, character record sheets, use of numerical attributes, and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of the release of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by &quot;D&amp;D&quot; include &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; (1975), &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; (1975), and &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot; (1976). The game&#x27;s commercial success was a factor that led to lawsuits regarding the distribution of royalties between original creators Gygax and Arneson. Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax&#x27;s decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.

The role-playing movement initiated by &quot;D&amp;D&quot; would lead to the release of the science fiction game &quot;Traveller&quot; (1977), the fantasy game &quot;RuneQuest&quot; (1978), and subsequent game systems such as Chaosium&#x27;s &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; (1981), &quot;Champions&quot; (1982), &quot;GURPS&quot; (1986), and &quot;&quot; (1991). &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and the games it influenced fed back into the genre&#x27;s origin – miniatures wargames – with combat strategy games like &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battles&quot;. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; also had a large impact on modern video games.

Director Jon Favreau credits &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; with giving him &quot;... a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance.&quot; ND Stevenson and the crew of &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; were strongly influenced by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, with Stevenson calling it basically a D&amp;D campaign, with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow falling into &quot;specific classes in D&amp;D&quot;. A &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign held among id Software staff in the early 1990s featured a demonic invasion, a warrior named &quot;Quake&quot; and a magic item named &quot;Daikatana&quot;. John Romero has credited the campaign with inspiring many of his video games of the era, including &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Daikatana&quot;.

Curtis D. Carbonell, in the 2019 book &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, wrote: &quot;Negative association with earlier niche &#x27;nerd&#x27; culture have reversed. 5e has become inclusive in its reach of players, after years of focusing on a white, male demographic. [...] At its simplest, the game system now encourages different types of persons to form a party not just to combat evil [...] but to engage in any number of adventure scenarios&quot;. Academic Emma French, in &quot;Real Life in Real Time: Live Streaming Culture&quot; (2023), commented on the impact of actual play on the broader &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; gaming culture – &quot;actual play media circumvents D&amp;D&#x27;s insulated or exclusionary aspects, skewing away from &#x27;basement dwelling nerds&#x27; in favor of a networked, global fandom. Live streaming is now a means of introducing individuals to the game, bringing it into the mainstream at a time when other geek pursuits have also achieved wider visibility and popularity&quot;. French highlighted that in 2020 &quot;no actual play live streams hosted by the official DnD channel featured an all-male cast—showing a massive shift from the brand ambassadors endorsed by Wizards of the Coast&quot; previously. French argued that not only has the more accessible and inclusive actual play landscape impacted the gaming culture but it has also impacted the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; product itself from the promotion campaign of &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot; featuring &quot;diverse nerd celebrities&quot; to &quot;direct action taken against previous exclusionary behavior&quot; as seen in Wizards of the Coast statements on diversity and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. French wrote, &quot;as actual play live streams broaden the range of customers that D&amp;D can market itself to, it may enact real, seismic change to the mainstream perception of geek identity, and contribute to a push for diverse representation within geek subculture as a whole&quot;.

==Related products==

&quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s commercial success has led to many other related products, including &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines, an animated television series, a film series, an off-Broadway stage production, an official role-playing soundtrack, novels, both ongoing and limited series licensed comics, and numerous computer and video games. Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, adventures, and other game aids related to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and its game offspring.

In November 2023, Hasbro&#x27;s Entertainment One launched the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventures&quot; FAST channel, available on platforms such as Amazon Freevee and Plex, which features new actual play web series, reruns of the animated &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; series, and reruns of other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; web series.

==In popular culture==


&quot;D&amp;D&quot; grew in popularity through the late 1970s and 1980s. Numerous games, films, and cultural references based on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; or &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players are (sometimes pejoratively) portrayed as the epitome of geekdom, and have become the basis of much geek and gamer humor and satire. Since the release of 5th edition, actual play web series and podcasts such as &quot;Critical Role&quot;, &quot;Dimension 20&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot;, among many others, have experienced a growth in viewership and popularity. According to Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, viewers on Twitch and YouTube spent over 150 million hours watching &quot;D&amp;D&quot; gameplay in 2020.

Famous &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players include Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz, professional basketball player Tim Duncan, comedian Stephen Colbert, and actors Vin Diesel and Robin Williams. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and its fans have been the subject of spoof films, including &quot;The Gamers: Dorkness Rising&quot;.

<doc id="7941" wikidata="Q5253920" url="?curid=7941" title="Double jeopardy">
<text>In jurisprudence, double jeopardy is a procedural defence (primarily in common law jurisdictions) that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges following an acquittal or conviction and in rare cases prosecutorial and/or judge misconduct in the same jurisdiction. Double jeopardy is a common concept in criminal law – in civil law, a similar concept is that of . The double jeopardy protection in criminal prosecutions bars only an identical prosecution for the same offence except when the defendant is a servicemember as the courts have ruled that the military courts are a separate sovereign, therefore servicemembers can be held in two separate trials for exactly the same charges; however, a different offence may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial. &quot;Res judicata&quot; protection is stronger – it precludes any causes of action or claims that arise from a previously litigated subject matter.

A variation in common law countries is the peremptory plea, which may take the specific forms of (&#x27;previously acquitted&#x27;) or (&#x27;previously convicted&#x27;). These doctrines appear to have originated in ancient Roman law, in the broader principle (&#x27;not twice against the same&#x27;).

== Availability as a legal defence ==

If a double jeopardy issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will typically rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In some countries, certain exemptions are permitted. In Scotland, a new trial can be initiated if, for example, the acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt. Part of English law for over 800 years, it was partially abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 where, following demand for change, serious offences may be re-tried following an acquittal if new and compelling evidence is found, and if the trial is found to be in the public&#x27;s interest. In some countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the guarantee against being &quot;twice put in jeopardy&quot; is a constitutional right. In other countries, the protection is afforded by statute.

In common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of (&#x27;previously acquitted&#x27;) or (&#x27;previously convicted&#x27;), with the same effect.

Double jeopardy is not a principle of international law. It does not apply between different countries, unless having been contractually agreed on between those countries as, for example, in the European Union (Art. 54 Schengen Convention), and in various extradition treaties between two countries.

== International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ==

The 72 signatories and 166 parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise, under Article 14 (7): &quot;No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.&quot; However, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns (unless the relevant extradition treaty expresses a prohibition).

== European Convention on Human Rights ==
All members of the Council of Europe (which includes nearly all European countries and every member of the European Union) have adopted the European Convention on Human Rights. The optional Protocol No. 7 to the convention, Article 4, protects against double jeopardy: &quot;No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.&quot;

All EU states ratified this optional protocol except for Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In those member states, national rules governing double jeopardy may or may not comply with the provision cited above.

Member states may, however, implement legislation which allows the reopening of a case if new evidence is found or if there was a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings:

In many European countries, the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court. This is not regarded as double jeopardy, but as a continuation of the same case. The European Convention on Human Rights permits this by using the phrase &quot;finally acquitted or convicted&quot; as the trigger for prohibiting subsequent prosecution.

== By country ==

=== Australia ===

In contrast to other common law nations, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to further prevent the prosecution for perjury following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of &quot;R v Carroll&quot;, where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll&#x27;s sworn alibi two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of Ipswich child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the High Court has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the England and Wales legislation.

During a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted, but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it. All states have now chosen to introduce legislation that mirrors COAG&#x27;s recommendations on &quot;fresh and compelling&quot; evidence.

In New South Wales, retrials of serious cases with a minimum sentence of 20 years or more are now possible even if the original trial preceded the 2006 reform. On 17 October 2006, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation abolishing the rule against double jeopardy in cases where:

* an acquittal of a &quot;life sentence offence&quot; (murder, violent gang rape, large commercial supply or production of illegal drugs) is debunked by &quot;fresh and compelling&quot; evidence of guilt;
* an acquittal of a &quot;15 years or more sentence offence&quot; was tainted (by perjury, bribery, or perversion of the course of justice).

On 30 July 2008, South Australia also introduced legislation to scrap parts of its double jeopardy law, legalising retrials for serious offences with &quot;fresh and compelling&quot; evidence, or if the acquittal was tainted.

In Western Australia, amendments introduced on 8 September 2011 allow retrial if &quot;new and compelling&quot; evidence is found. It applies to serious offences where the penalty is life imprisonment or imprisonment for 14 years or more. Acquittal because of tainting (witness intimidation, jury tampering, or perjury) also permits retrial.

In Tasmania, on 19 August 2008, amendments were introduced to allow retrial in serious cases if there is &quot;fresh and compelling&quot; evidence.

In Victoria on 21 December 2011, legislation was passed allowing new trials where there is &quot;fresh and compelling DNA evidence, where the person acquitted subsequently admits to the crime, or where it becomes clear that key witnesses have given false evidence&quot;. However, retrial applications could only be made for serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, arson causing death, serious drug offences and aggravated forms of rape and armed robbery.

In Queensland on 18 October 2007, the double jeopardy laws were modified to allow a retrial where fresh and compelling evidence becomes available after an acquittal for murder or a &quot;tainted acquittal&quot; for a crime carrying a 25-year or more sentence. A &quot;tainted acquittal&quot; requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal.

=== Canada ===

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms includes provisions such as section 11(h) prohibiting double jeopardy. However, the prohibition only applies after an accused person has been &quot;finally&quot; convicted or acquitted. Canadian law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal based on legal errors. In rare circumstances, when a trial judge made all the factual findings necessary for a finding of guilt but misapplied the law, a court of appeal might also directly substitute an acquittal for a conviction. These cases are not considered double jeopardy because the appeal and the subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.

For an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the Supreme Court of Canada requires the Crown to show that an error in law was made during the trial and that it contributed to the verdict. It has been argued that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, in his book &quot;My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures&quot;, Martin Friedland contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be &quot;responsible&quot; for the verdict, not just a factor.

Though the charter permits appeals of acquittals, there are still constitutional limits imposed on the scope of these appeals. In &quot;Corp. Professionnelle des Médecins v. Thibault&quot;, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of Quebec law that allowed appellate courts to conduct a &quot;de novo&quot; review of both legal and factual findings. In doing so, it held that the scope of an appeal may not extend to challenging findings of fact where no legal error has been made. At this point, the court reasoned, the process ceases to be an appeal and instead becomes a new trial disguised as one.

A notable example cited by critics of Canada&#x27;s appeal system is the case of Guy Paul Morin, who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court. Another notable use of the system occurred in the case of child murderer Guy Turcotte, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned the initial verdict of not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge had erroneously instructed the jury. Turcotte was later convicted of second-degree murder in the second trial. Another well-known example is Henry Morgentaler, whose repeated acquittals by juries were overturned on appeal in multiple provinces.

=== France ===

Once all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was forged. Prosecution for a crime already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on the grounds of new exculpating evidence through a procedure known as &quot;révision&quot;.

French law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal.

=== Germany ===

The Basic Law (&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;) for the Federal Republic of Germany protects against double jeopardy if a final verdict is pronounced. A verdict is final if nobody appeals against it.

However, each trial party can appeal against a verdict in the first instance. The prosecution or the defendants can appeal against a judgement if they disagree with it. In this case, the trial starts again in the second instance, the court of appeal (&quot;Berufungsgericht&quot;), which reconsiders the facts and reasons and delivers a final judgement.

If one of the parties disagrees with the second instance&#x27;s judgement, they can appeal it only for formal judicial reasons. The case will be checked in the third instance (&quot;Revisionsgericht&quot;) to see whether all laws were correctly applied.

The rule applies to the whole &quot;historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural&quot;. This is true even if new facts come to light that indicate other crimes.

The Penal Procedural Code (&quot;Strafprozessordnung&quot;) permits a retrial (&quot;Wiederaufnahmeverfahren&quot;), if it is in favour of the defendant or if the following events have happened:

In the case of an order of summary punishment, which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:

In Germany, a felony is defined by § 12 (1) StGB as a crime that has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.

=== India ===

A partial protection against double jeopardy is a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the Constitution of India, which states &quot;No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once&quot;. This provision enshrines the concept of &quot;autrefois convict&quot;, that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time. However, it does not extend to &quot;autrefois acquit&quot;, and so if a person is acquitted of a crime he can be retried. In India, protection against &quot;autrefois acquit&quot; is a statutory right, not a fundamental one. Such protection is provided by provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure rather than by the Constitution.

=== Japan ===
The Constitution of Japan, which came into effect on 3 May 1947, states in Article 39 that

However, in 1950, one defendant was found guilty in the District Court for crimes related to the election law and was sentenced to paying a fine. The prosecutor wanted a stronger sentence and appealed to the High Court. As a result, the defendant was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the sentence was excessive when compared with precedents and that he had been placed in double jeopardy, which was in violation of Article 39. On 27 September 1950, all fifteen judges of the Supreme Court made the Grand Bench Decision to rule against the defendant and declared that a criminal proceeding in the District Court, High Court and Supreme Court is all one case and that there is no double jeopardy. In other words, if the prosecutor appeals against a judgement of not guilty or a guilty decision that they think does not impose a severe enough sentence, the defendant will not be placed in double jeopardy.

On 10 October 2003, the Supreme Court made a landmark decision in the area of double jeopardy. The case involved Article 235 of the Penal Code, which addresses &quot;simple larceny&quot;, and Article 2 of the Law for Prevention and Disposition of Robbery, Theft, etc., which addresses &quot;habitual larceny&quot;. The Court ruled that in the event that there are two trials for separate cases of simple larceny, it will not be considered double jeopardy, even if the prosecutor could have charged both of them as a single crime of habitual larceny. The defendant in this case had committed crimes of trespassing and simple larceny on 22 occasions. The defence counsel argued that the crimes were actually one offence of habitual larceny and that charging them as separate counts was double jeopardy. The Supreme Court ruled that it was within the prosecutor&#x27;s discretion as to whether to charge the defendant with one count of habitual larceny or to charge them with multiple counts of trespassing and simple larceny. In either case, it is not considered double jeopardy.

=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, the state prosecution can appeal a not-guilty verdict at the bench. New evidence can be applied during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.

On 9 April 2013, the Dutch senate voted 36 &quot;yes&quot; versus 35 &quot;no&quot; in favour of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court. This law is limited to offences in which the statute of limitations does not expire. These are offences that are punishable by at least 12 years of imprisonment, and other specific offences. Offences that have already expired (such as prior to the change in legislation that abolished the statute of limitations) cannot be retried. 

A retrial is only possible by ground of a &#x27;novum&#x27;: the situation in which new evidence has come to light and in which it seems that, had the judge known of this evidence, the defendant would have been prosecuted. The new evidence has to either be new technical evidence or a trustworthy confession by the defendant or their co-suspect.

=== Pakistan ===
Article 13 of the Constitution of Pakistan protects a person from being punished or prosecuted more than once for the same offence. Section 403 of The Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates a situation where a person having once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted by such court cannot be tried again for the same offence or for any other offence based on similar facts. The scope of section 403 is restricted to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings and departmental inquiries.

=== Serbia ===
This principle is incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and further elaborated in its Criminal Procedure Act.

=== South Africa ===

The Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa forbids a retrial when there has already been an acquittal or a conviction.

=== South Korea ===

Article 13 of the South Korean constitution provides that no citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====

Double jeopardy has been permitted in England and Wales in certain (exceptional) circumstances since the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

===== Pre-2003 =====

The doctrines of &quot;autrefois acquit&quot; and &quot;autrefois convict&quot; persisted as part of the common law from the time of the Norman conquest of England; they were regarded as essential elements for protection of the subject&#x27;s liberty and respect for due process of law in that there should be finality of proceedings. There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:

* The prosecution has a right of appeal against acquittal in summary cases if the decision appears to be wrong in law or in excess of jurisdiction.
* A retrial is permissible if the interests of justice so require, following an appeal against conviction by a defendant.
* A &quot;tainted acquittal&quot;, where there has been an offence of interference with, or intimidation of, a juror or witness, can be challenged in the High Court.

In &quot;Connelly v DPP&quot; [1964] AC 1254, the Law Lords ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted unless there are &quot;special circumstances&quot; proven by the prosecution. There is little case law on the meaning of &quot;special circumstances&quot;, but it has been suggested that the emergence of new evidence would suffice.

A defendant who had been convicted of an offence could be given a second trial for an aggravated form of that offence if the facts constituting the aggravation were discovered after the first conviction. By contrast, a person who had been acquitted of a lesser offence could not be tried for an aggravated form even if new evidence became available.

===== Post-2003 =====

Following the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the Macpherson Report recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if &quot;fresh and viable&quot; new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report &quot;Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals&quot; (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a past Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report six months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that &quot;the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify.&quot; 1999 was also the year of a highly publicised case in which a man, David Smith, was convicted of the murder of a prostitute after having been acquitted of the &quot;almost identical&quot; murder of sex worker Sarah Crump six years previously. Because of the double jeopardy laws that existed at the time, Smith could not be re-tried for Crump&#x27;s murder, despite police insisting they were not looking for anybody else and that the case was closed and the BBC reporting that Smith had &quot;beat&quot; the earlier murder charge. 

Both Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) and William Hague (then Leader of the Opposition) favoured the measures suggested by the Auld Report. These recommendations were implemented—not uncontroversially at the time—within the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this provision came into force in April 2005. It opened certain serious crimes (including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and serious drug crimes) to a retrial, regardless of when committed, with two conditions: the retrial must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Court of Appeal must agree to quash the original acquittal due to &quot;new and compelling evidence&quot;. Then Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said that he expected no more than a handful of cases to be brought in a year.

Pressure by Ann Ming, the mother of 1989 murder victim Julie Hogg—whose killer, Billy Dunlop, was initially acquitted and subsequently confessed—also contributed to the demand for legal change. On 11 September 2006, Dunlop became the first person to be convicted of murder following a prior acquittal for the same crime, in his case his 1991 acquittal of Hogg&#x27;s murder. Some years later he had confessed to the crime, and was convicted of perjury, but was unable to be retried for the killing itself. The case was re-investigated in early 2005, when the new law came into effect, and his case was referred to the Court of Appeal, in November 2005, for permission for a new trial, which was granted. Dunlop pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation he serve no less than 17 years.

On 13 December 2010, Mark Weston became the first person to be retried and found guilty of murder by a jury (Dunlop having confessed). In 1996 Weston had been acquitted of the murder of Vikki Thompson at Ascott-under-Wychwood on 12 August 1995, but following the discovery in 2009 of compelling new evidence (Thompson&#x27;s blood on Weston&#x27;s boots) he was arrested and tried for a second time. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 13 years.

In December 2018, convicted paedophile Russell Bishop was also retried and found guilty by a jury for the Babes in the Wood murders of two 9-year-old girls, Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway, on 9 October 1986. At the original trial in 1987, a key piece of the prosecution&#x27;s case rested on the recovery of a discarded blue sweatshirt. Under questioning, Bishop denied that the sweatshirt belonged to him, but his girlfriend, Jennifer Johnson, alleged the clothing was Bishop&#x27;s, before she changed her story in the trial, telling the jury she had never seen the top before. Attributed to a series of blunders in the prosecution&#x27;s case, Bishop was acquitted by the jury after two hours of deliberations. Three years later, Bishop was found guilty of the abduction, molestation, and attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl in February 1990. In 2014, re-examined by modern forensics, the sweatshirt contained traces of Bishop&#x27;s DNA, and also had fibres on it from both of the girls&#x27; clothing. Tapings taken from Karen Hadaway&#x27;s arm also yielded traces of Bishop&#x27;s DNA. At the 2018 trial, a jury of seven men and five women returned a guilty verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation.

On 14 November 2019, Michael Weir became the first person to be twice found guilty of a murder. He was originally convicted of the murder of Leonard Harris in 1999, but the conviction was quashed in 2000 by the Court of Appeal on a technicality. In 2018, new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. Twenty years after the original conviction, Weir was convicted of the murder for a second time.

In February 2020, Merseyside Police called for further reform to the double jeopardy law in England so as to allow previously acquitted suspects to be re-interviewed by police. The force had wanted to re-interview a suspect in the unsolved case of the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller who had been acquitted of the crime in 1981, but were not permitted to do so. The force had also not been allowed to re-charge the man of murder in 2019, causing them to publicly request that the law be changed and stating: &quot;We believe being able to re-question suspects could potentially lead to being able to demonstrate the new and compelling evidence needed to reopen particular cases, including the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller&quot;.

==== Scotland ====

The double jeopardy rule no longer applies absolutely in Scotland since the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011 came into force on 28 November 2011. The Act introduced three broad exceptions to the rule: where the acquittal had been tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice; where the accused admitted their guilt after acquittal; and where there was new evidence.

==== Northern Ireland ====

In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, effective 18 April 2005, makes certain &quot;qualifying offence&quot; (including murder, rape, kidnapping, specified sexual acts with young children, specified drug offences, defined acts of terrorism, as well as in certain cases attempts or conspiracies to commit the foregoing) subject to retrial after acquittal (including acquittals obtained before passage of the Act) if there is a finding by the Court of Appeal that there is &quot;new and compelling evidence&quot;.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the protection in common law against double jeopardy is maintained through the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides:

Conversely, double jeopardy comes with a key exception. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, multiple sovereigns can indict a defendant for the same crime. The federal and state governments can have overlapping criminal laws, so a criminal offender may be convicted in individual states and federal courts for exactly the same crime or for different crimes arising out of the same facts. However, in 2016, the Supreme Court held in &quot;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle&quot; that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The dual sovereignty doctrine has been the subject of substantial scholarly criticism.

As described by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Ball v. United States&quot; 163 U.S. 662 (1896), one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, &quot;the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial&quot;. The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment. Jeopardy &quot;attaches&quot; when the jury is impanelled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is accepted.

==== Prosecution after acquittal ====

With two exceptions, the government is not permitted to appeal or retry the defendant once jeopardy attaches to a trial unless the case does not conclude. Conditions which constitute &quot;conclusion&quot; of a case include

* After the entry of an acquittal, whether:
** an acquittal by jury verdict
** a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,
** a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,
** an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or
** an &quot;implied acquittal&quot; via conviction of a lesser included offence.
* re-litigating against the same defence a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts. In such a situation, the government is barred by collateral estoppel.

In these cases, the trial is concluded and the prosecution is precluded from appealing or retrying the defendant over the offence to which they were acquitted.

This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal, or a directed verdict after a jury conviction, nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute. Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency, including &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, or &quot;thirteenth juror&quot; appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not &quot;terminated&quot;.

The dual sovereignty doctrine allows a federal prosecution of an offence to proceed regardless of a previous state prosecution for that same offence and vice versa because &quot;an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offence against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each&quot;. The doctrine is solidly entrenched in the law, but there has been a traditional reluctance in the federal executive branch to gratuitously wield the power it grants, due to public opinion being generally hostile to such action.

==== Exceptions ====
There are two exceptions to bans on retrying defendants. If a defendant bribed a judge into acquitting him or her, the defendant was not in jeopardy and can be retried. A member of the armed forces can be retried by court-martial in a military court, even if he or she has been previously acquitted by a civilian court. This exception was used to prosecute Timothy Hennis for the Eastburn family murders after his previous trial acquitted him.

An individual can be prosecuted by both the United States and an Indian tribe for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions; it was established by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Lara&quot; that as the two are separate sovereigns, prosecuting a crime under both tribal and federal law does not attach double jeopardy.

==== Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction ====

In &quot;Blockburger v. United States&quot; (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not. &quot;Blockburger&quot; is the default rule, unless the governing statute legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.

The &quot;Blockburger&quot; test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In &quot;Grady v. Corbin&quot; (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the &quot;Blockburger&quot; test was not satisfied, but &quot;Grady&quot; was later distinguished in &quot;United States v. Felix&quot; (1992), when the court reverted to the &quot;Blockburger&quot; test without completely dismissing the &quot;Grady&quot; interpretation. The court eventually overruled &quot;Grady&quot; in &quot;United States v. Dixon&quot; (1993).

==== Prosecution after mistrial ====

The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in &quot;bad faith&quot;, i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial. If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds &quot;manifest necessity&quot; for granting the mistrial. The same standard governs mistrials granted sua sponte.

Retrials are not common, due to the legal expenses to the government. However, in the mid-1980s Georgia antique dealer James Arthur Williams was tried a record four times for murder over the shooting of Danny Hansford, and after three mistrials was finally acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The case is recounted in the book &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,&quot; which was adapted into a film directed by Clint Eastwood (the movie combines the four trials into one).

<text>Disbarment, also known as striking off, is the removal of a lawyer from a bar association or the practice of law, thus revoking their law license or admission to practice law. Disbarment is usually a punishment for unethical or criminal conduct but may also be imposed for incompetence or incapacity. Procedures vary depending on the law society; temporary disbarment may be called suspension.

==Australia==
In Australia, states regulate the Legal Profession under state law despite many participating in a uniform scheme. Admission as a lawyer is the business of the admissions board and the Supreme Court. Disciplinary proceedings may be commenced by the Bar Association, the Law Society of which one is a member, or the board itself.

==Germany==
In Germany, a &quot;Berufsverbot&quot; is a ban on practicing a profession, which the government can issue to a lawyer for misconduct, &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.

In April 1933, the Nazi government issued a &quot;Berufsverbot&quot; forbidding the practice of law by Jews, Communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the &quot;Frontkämpferprivileg&quot;.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the removal of the licence to practise of a barrister or Scottish advocate is called being &quot;disbarred&quot;, whilst the removal of a solicitor from the rolls in England and Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland is called being &quot;struck off&quot;.

==United States==
===Overview===
Generally, disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding a client&#x27;s interests, commingling funds, or engaging in fraud that impedes the administration of justice. In some states, any lawyer who is convicted of a felony is automatically suspended pending further disciplinary proceedings, or, in New York, automatically disbarred. Automatic disbarment, although opposed by the American Bar Association, has been described as a convicted felon&#x27;s just deserts.

In the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts while still being a member of the bar in another jurisdiction. However, under the American Bar Association&#x27;s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare: in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred. Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to continue a career in law.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, most US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.

===Notable U.S. disbarments===

In the 20th and 21st centuries, one former U.S. president and one former U.S. vice president have been disbarred, and another former president has been suspended from one bar and forced to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.

Former vice president Spiro Agnew, having pleaded no contest (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of bribery and tax evasion, was disbarred from Maryland, the state of which he had previously been governor.

Former president Richard Nixon was disbarred from New York in 1976 for obstruction of justice related to the Watergate scandal. He had attempted to resign from the New York bar, as he had done with California and the Supreme Court, but his resignation was not accepted as he would not acknowledge that he was unable to defend himself from the charges brought against him.

In 2001, following a 5-year suspension by the Arkansas bar, the United States Supreme Court suspended Bill Clinton from the United States Supreme Court bar, providing 40 days for him to contest disbarment. He resigned before the end of the 40 days, thus avoiding disbarment.

Alger Hiss was disbarred for a felony conviction but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.

In 2007, Mike Nifong, the District Attorney of Durham County, North Carolina who presided over the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, was disbarred for prosecutorial misconduct related to his handling of the case.

In April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar Andrew Thomas, former County Attorney of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. According to the panel, Thomas &quot;outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law&quot; while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general. &quot;Were this a criminal case,&quot; the panel concluded, &quot;we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;

Jack Thompson, the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against Howard Stern, video games, and rap music, was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action resulted from several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass, or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson tried to appeal to the higher courts to avoid the penalty taking effect. Neither the US District Court nor the US Supreme Court would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.

Ed Fagan, a New York lawyer who prominently represented Holocaust victims against Swiss banks, was disbarred in New York (in 2008) and New Jersey (in 2009) for failing to pay court fines and fees; and for misappropriating client and escrow trust funds.

F. Lee Bailey, noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment resulted from his stock handling in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc&#x27;s assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book &quot;Florida Pulp Nonfiction&quot; details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case and extended interviews with Bailey, including his own defense. Bailey is also best known for representing murder suspect O. J. Simpson in 1994.

Richard P. Liebowitz, a New York attorney focused on copyrights held by photographers, was disbarred by the state of New York in 2024 following suspension from the practice of law in the Southern District of New York. His disbarment followed what was described as a &quot;pattern and practice of failing to comply with court orders and making false statements to the court&quot; and multiple lawsuits wherein Liebowitz was sanctioned for misconduct.

Rudy Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., for false allegations about mass voter fraud and his participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol to subvert the 2020 Presidential Election.

<doc id="7946" wikidata="Q590167" url="?curid=7946" title="Dog tag">
<text>Dog tag is an informal but common term for a specific type of identification tag worn by military personnel. The tags&#x27; primary use is for the identification of casualties; they have information about the individual written on them, including identification and essential basic medical information such as blood type and history of inoculations. They often indicate a religious preference as well.

Dog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal. They commonly contain two copies of the information, either in the form of a single tag that can be broken in half, or as two identical tags on the same chain. This purposeful duplication allows one tag, or half-tag, to be collected from an individual&#x27;s dead body for notification, while the duplicate remains with the corpse if the conditions of battle prevent it from being immediately recovered. The term arose and became popular because of the tags&#x27; resemblance to animal registration tags. Although typically worn around the neck, Dog tags have been worn on boot laces and wristbands etc.

== History ==
The earliest mention of an identification tag for soldiers comes in Polyaenus (Stratagems 1.17) where the Spartans wrote their names on sticks tied to their left wrists. A type of dog tag (&quot;signaculum&quot;) was given to the Roman legionary at the moment of enrollment. The legionary &quot;signaculum&quot; was a lead disk with a leather string, worn around the neck, with the name of the recruit and the indication of the legion of which the recruit was part. This procedure, together with enrollment in the list of recruits, was made at the beginning of a four-month probatory period (&quot;probatio&quot;). The recruit obtained the military status only after the oath of allegiance (&quot;sacramentum&quot;) at the end of &quot;probatio&quot;, meaning that from a legal point of view the &quot;signaculum&quot; was given to a subject who was no longer a civilian, but not yet in the military.

In more recent times, dog tags were provided to Chinese soldiers as early as the mid-19th century. During the Taiping revolt (1851–66), both the Imperialists (i.e., the Chinese Imperial Army regular servicemen) and those Taiping rebels wearing a uniform wore wooden dog tags at the belt, bearing the soldier&#x27;s name, age, birthplace, unit, and date of enlistment.

=== American Civil War ===
During the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, some soldiers pinned paper notes with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stenciled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of their army belt buckles.

Manufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service, and engraved with the soldier&#x27;s name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of brass or lead with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield, and such phrases as &quot;War for the Union&quot; or &quot;Liberty, Union, and Equality&quot;. The other side had the soldier&#x27;s name and unit, and sometimes a list of battles in which he had participated.

===Franco-Prussian War===
On a volunteer basis Prussian soldiers had decided to wear identification tags in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. However, many rejected dog tags as a bad omen for their lives. So until eight months after the Battle of Königgrätz, with almost 8,900 Prussian casualties, only 429 of them could be identified. With the formation of the North German Confederation in 1867 Prussian military regulations became binding for the militaries of all North German member states. With the Prussian &quot;Instruktion über das Sanitätswesen der Armee im Felde&quot; (i.e., instruction on the medical corps organisation of the army afield) issued on 29 April 1869 identification tags (then called &quot;Erkennungsmarke&quot;; literally &quot;recognition mark&quot;) were to be handed out to each soldier before deployment afield. The Prussian Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. They were nicknamed &quot;Hundemarken&quot; (the German equivalent of &quot;dog tags&quot;) and compared to a similar identification system instituted by the dog licence fee, adding tags to collars of those dogs whose owners paid the fee, in the Prussian capital city of Berlin at around the same time period.

===World War I===
The British Army introduced identity discs in place of identity cards in 1907, in the form of aluminium discs, typically made at regimental depots using machines similar to those common at fun fairs, the details being pressed into the thin metal one letter at a time.

Army Order 287 of September 1916 required the British Army provide all soldiers with two official tags, both made of vulcanised asbestos fibre (which were more comfortable to wear in hot climates) carrying identical details, again impressed one character at a time. The first tag, an octagonal green disc, was attached to a long cord around the neck. The second tag, a circular red disc, was threaded on a 6-inch cord suspended from the first tag. The first tag was intended to remain on the body for future identification, while the second tag could be taken to record the death.

British and Empire/Commonwealth forces (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) were issued essentially identical identification discs of basic pattern during the Great War, Second World War and Korea, though official identity discs were frequently supplemented by private-purchase items such as identity bracelets, particularly favoured by sailors who believed the official discs were unlikely to survive long immersion in water.

The U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:

The U.S. Army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the U.S. Army adopted and allotted the service number system, and name and service numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags.

===World War II &quot;notched&quot; tags===

There is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during World War II, and up until the Korean War era. It was rumored that the notch&#x27;s purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.

In reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II). American dogtags of the 1930s through 1980s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates. Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.

In the Graphotype process, commonly used commercially from the early 1900s through the 1980s, a debossing machine was used to stamp characters into metal plates; the plates could then be used to repetitively stamp such things as addresses onto paper in the same way that a typewriter functions, except that a single stroke of the printer could produce a block of text, rather than requiring each character to be printed individually. The debossing process creates durable, easily legible metal plates, well-suited for military identification tags, leading to adoption of the system by the American military. It was also realized that debossed tags can function the same way the original Graphotype plates do.

The Model 70 took advantage of this fact, and was intended to rapidly print all of the information from a soldier&#x27;s dogtag directly onto medical and personnel forms, with a single squeeze of the trigger. However, this requires that the tag being inserted with the proper orientation (stamped characters facing down), and it was believed that battlefield stress could lead to errors. To force proper orientation of the tags, the tags are produced with a notch, and there is a locator tab inside the Model 70 which prevents the printer from operating if the tag is inserted with the notch in the wrong place (as it is if the tag is upside down).

This feature was not as useful in the field as had been hoped, however, due to adverse conditions such as weather, dirt and dust, water, etc. In addition, the Model 70 resembled a pistol, thus attracting the attention of snipers (who might assume that a man carrying a pistol was an officer). As a result, use of the Model 70 hand imprinter by field medics was rapidly abandoned (as were most of the Model 70s themselves), and eventually the specification that tags include the locator notch was removed from production orders. Existing stocks of tags were used until depleted, and in the 1960s it was not uncommon for a soldier to be issued one tag with the notch and one tag without. Notched tags are still in production, to satisfy the needs of hobbyists, film production, etc., while the Model 70 imprinter has become a rare collector&#x27;s item.

It appears instructions that would confirm the notch&#x27;s mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the Graves Registration Service during the Vietnam War to Army troops headed overseas.

Dog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers created for their fallen comrades. The casualty&#x27;s rifle with bayonet affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the rifle&#x27;s stock. The dog tags hang from the rifle&#x27;s handle or trigger guard.

==Non-military usage==

===Medical condition identification===

Some tags (along with similar items such as MedicAlert bracelets) are used also by civilians to identify their wearers and:
* specify them as having health problems that may suddenly incapacitate their wearers and render them incapable of providing treatment guidance (as in the cases of heart problems, epilepsy, diabetic coma, accident or major trauma)
* specify them as having health problems that may interact adversely with medical treatments, especially standard or &quot;first-line&quot; ones (as in the case of an allergy to common medications)
* provide in case of emergency (&quot;ICE&quot;) contact information
* state a religious, moral, or other objection to artificial resuscitation, if a first responder attempts to administer such treatment when the wearer is non-responsive and thus unable to warn against doing so. A DNR signed by a physician is still required in some states.

Military personnel in some jurisdictions may wear a supplementary medical information tag.

=== Fashion ===
Dog tags have found their way into youth fashion as military chic. Originally worn as a part of a military uniform by youth wishing to present a tough or militaresque image, dog tags have since reached wider fashion circles. They may be inscribed with a person&#x27;s details, beliefs or tastes, a favorite quote, or may bear the name or logo of a band or performer. The wearing of dog tags as a fashion accessory can be considered disrespectful by some military personnel.

Since the late 1990s, custom dog tags have been fashionable amongst musicians (particularly rappers), and as a marketing give-away item. Numerous companies offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text. High-end jewellers have featured gold and silver dog tags encrusted with diamonds and other jewels.

After the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which over 250 hostages were kidnapped from Israel to the Gaza Strip, dog tags became a symbol of the movement to free the Israeli hostages. It became common for people in Israel and elsewhere to publicly wear their own military dog tags or specially made dog tags to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and to symbolize a call for the immediate release or rescue of the hostages. Phrases inscribed on the purpose-made dog tags include &quot;bring them home now,&quot; &quot;7.10.23,&quot; and &quot;הלב שלנו שבוי בעזה&quot; (English: &quot;our hearts are captive in Gaza&quot;). These inscribed dog tags are sold in markets and online shops, often as part of fundraisers to benefit the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, or other similar causes.

==Variations by country==
=== Austria ===

The Austrian &quot;Bundesheer&quot; used a single long, rectangular tag, with oval ends, stamped with blood group &amp; Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath. Two slots and a hole stamped beneath allows the tag to be broken in halves, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number and a series of holes which allows the tag to be inserted into a dosimeter. This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider and rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.

=== Australia ===

The Australian Defence Force issues soldiers two tags of different shapes, one octagonal and one circular, containing the following information:
* AS (denoting Australia, previously both AU and AUST have been used)
* PMKeyS/Service number
* First initial
* Last name
* Religious abbreviation (e.g. RC – Roman Catholic, NREL – No religion)
* Blood group

The information is printed exactly the same on both discs. In the event of a casualty, the circular tag is removed from the body.

=== Belgium ===

Belgian Forces identity tags are, like the Canadian and Norwegian, designed to be broken in two in case of fatality; the lower half is returned to the Belgian Defence staff, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:

* Upper half:
** &quot;Belgisch Leger&quot; (Belgian Army) and Date of Birth in DD/MM/YYYY format.
** Surname with the addition of the first letter of given name.
** Service number and blood group with RH factor and optionally religion.
* Lower half: identical.
* Example:
** Belgisch Leger 01/01/1991
** Surname J
** 1234567 O+ KATH

=== Canada ===
Canadian Forces identity discs (abbreviated &quot;ID discs&quot;) are designed to be broken in two in the case of fatality; the lower half is returned to National Defence Headquarters with the member&#x27;s personal documents, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:
* Upper half:
** Service Number (SN)
** Initials and surname
** Religion (or &quot;NRE&quot; if none) and blood group with RH factor
** The legend &quot;CDN FORCES CDN&quot; (or for foreign nationals, the name of the country the individual represents)
** The text &quot;DO NOT REMOVE / NE PAS ENLEVER&quot; on the reverse
* Lower half: identical, except that the reverse is blank.

Before the Service Number was introduced in the 1990s, military personnel were identified on the ID discs (as well as other documents) by their social insurance number.

=== China ===

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army issues two long, rectangular tags. All information is stamped in Simplified Chinese:

* Full name
* Gender
* Date of birth
* RIC number
* PLA&#x27;s ID number
* Blood type
* Branch

PLA is introducing a two-dimensional matrix code on the second tag, the matrix code contains a link to the official database. This allows the inquirer get more details about the military personnel.

=== Colombia ===

The Ejército Nacional de Colombia uses long, rectangular metal tags with oval ends tags stamped with the following information:

* Family Name
* First Name
* Military ID Number
* Blood Type
* Branch of Service

Duplicate tags are issued. Often, tags are issued with a prayer inscribed on the reverse.

=== Cyprus ===

In Cyprus, identification tags include the following information:

* Surname
* First name
* Service number (E.g., 11111/00/00B, where the first five digits are the ID, the second two are the year the soldier turned 18 years old, the last two digits are the year the soldier enlisted, and the letter is the enlistment group, either A or B)
* Blood Group

=== Denmark ===
The military of Denmark use dog tags made from small, rectangular metal plates. The tag is designed to be broken into two pieces each with the following information stamped onto it:

* Personal identification number
* Surname
* First name

Additionally, the right hand side of each half-tag is engraved .
Starting in 1985, the individual&#x27;s service number (which is the same as the social security number) is included on the tag. In case the individual dies, the lower half-tag is supposed to be collected, while the other will remain with the corpse. In the army, navy, and air force but not in the national guard, the individual&#x27;s blood type is indicated on the lower half-tag only, since this information becomes irrelevant if the individual dies. In 2009, Danish dog tags were discontinued for conscripts.

=== East Germany ===

The &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; used a tag nearly identical to that used by both the Wehrmacht and the West German Bundeswehr. The oval aluminum tag was stamped &quot;DDR&quot; (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which was intended to be broken off in case of death. Oddly, the tag was not worn (but would have been in case of war), but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve in the back of the WDA (&quot;Wehrdienstausweis&quot;) identity booklet.

=== Ecuador ===

The &quot;Placas de identificación de campaña&quot; consists of two long, rectangular steel or aluminum tags with rounded corners and a single hole punched in one end. It is suspended by a US-type ball chain, with a shorter chain for the second tag. The information on the tag is:

* Family Name &amp; First Name
* Identification Number
* Blood Group, plus &quot;RH&quot; and &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;

=== Estonia ===

Estonian dog tags are designed to be broken in two. The dog tag is a metallic rounded rectangle suspended by a ball chain. Information consists of four fields:

* National identification number
* Nationality
* Blood Group
* Religion

Example: 
* 39305231234
* EST
* A(II) Rh Pos (+)
* NONE

=== Finland ===

In the Finnish Defence Forces, &quot;&quot;tunnuslevy&quot; or WWII term &quot;tuntolevy&quot;&quot; (Finnish for &quot;Identification plate&quot;) is made of stainless steel and designed to be broken in two; however, the only text on it is the personal identification number and the letters &quot;FI&quot; or &quot;SF&quot; in older models, which stands for Suomi Finland, within a tower stamped atop of the upper half.

=== France ===

In WWI and WWII, French forces used a small oval-shaped disc of metal designed to be broken in half, worn at the wrist.

Now, France issues either a metallic rounded rectangle (army) or a pair of disc (air force, navy), 

designed to be broken in half, bearing family name &amp; first name above the ID number.

French army tags also include blood type,&quot;T&quot; for Tetanus vaccine and &quot;OFF&quot; only for officers.

Picture show last model, &quot;plaque d&#x27;identité modèle 1995&quot;.

=== Germany ===

See above for former &quot;East Germany&quot;.

German Bundeswehr ID tags are an oval-shaped disc designed to be broken in half. They are made of stainless steel, height and width. The two sides contain different information which are mirrored upside-down on the lower half of the ID tag. They feature the following information on segmented and numbered fields:

On the front:

* Field 1: blank (provided for Gender but never used)
* Field 2: DEU (for Deutschland) (GE (for Germany) only on older ID tags)
* Field 3: Religious preference (&quot;K&quot; or &quot;RK&quot; for Roman Catholic, &quot;E&quot; or &quot;EV&quot; for Protestant, &quot;O&quot; for Christian Orthodox, &quot;ISL&quot; for Islamic, &quot;JD&quot; for Jewish, blank if no preference)
* Field 4: Personenkennziffer (service number: birth date in DDMMYY format, dash, capitalized first letter of last name, dash, and five-digit number based on soldier&#x27;s home military administrative district, number of persons with the mentioned last name initial and same birthday, and an error-checking number but without dashes), ex. 101281-S-455(-)6(-)8

On the back:

* Field 5: Blood group (A, AB, B, 0)
* Field 6: Rh factor (Rh+ or Rh-)
* Field 7: Vaccination status (&quot;T82&quot; for Tetanus and year of basic immunization)
* Fields 8–10: blank

&quot;Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung&quot; of 2009-12-21 specifies shape, materials and characteristics for four parts:

* &quot;Erkennungsmarke&quot; (identification tag) stainless steel (&quot;Edelstahl&quot;)
* &quot;Erkennungsmarke, nicht magnetisierbar&quot; (identification tag, non-magnetizable) for personnel working for special tasks, non-magnetic stainless steel
* &quot;Sanitätswarnmarke&quot;, short &quot;Warnmarke&quot; (health warn tag) aluminium, anodized red, carried only if necessary with a second chain depending from the lower half of the ID tag
* &quot;Halskette&quot; (necklace) – &quot;Kugelkette&quot; DIN 5280, stainless steel – 2 parts: one long for neck and ID, one short for warn tag to ID tag.

The ID tag is landscape-oval, breakable in two halves with 4–8 manual bends. On the backside each half is 0.2 mm deep marked with &quot;DEU&quot; for &quot;Deutschland&quot;, the non-magnetic type on both halves and both sides with &quot;NM&quot;.

The metal sheet is 0.7 mm thick, material codes X5CrNi1810 or 1.4301, weighs about 16 g. NM-variant shall consist of 1.4311 or 1.4401. Sharp edges have to be smoothed, then the plate electropolished. Mechanical deburring and ball polishing is allowed.

The letters stamped in for the person must stay readable after a glow test for 10 minutes in air at 1200 °C.

The ball chain is of X5CrNi1810, diameter of ball is 3.5 mm, that of the wire 1.5 mm. Closure is of 1.4301, stainless steel, too. The long chain is 680 + 30 mm long, the short one 145 + 7 mm. Breaking force of the chain including the closure must reach 100 N, after 10 min glow at 1200 °C in air at least 10 N.

=== Greece ===

In Greece, identification tags include the following information:
* Surname
* First name
* Service number (where date of birth is included as &quot;class&quot;)
* Blood Group

=== Hungary ===

The Hungarian army dog tag is made out of steel, forming a 25×35 mm tag designed to split diagonally. Both sides contain the same information: the soldier&#x27;s personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. These are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army&#x27;s official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.

=== Iraq ===

The Saddam-era Iraqi Army used a single, long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, inscribed (usually by hand) with Name and Number or Unit, and occasionally Blood Type.

=== Israel ===

Dog tags of the Israel Defense Forces are designed to be broken in two. The information appears in three lines (twice):
*Army identification number (&quot;mispar ishi&quot;, literally &quot;personal number&quot;. A seven-digit number that is different from the nine-digit identification number for citizens).
* Last name
* First Name
* Blood Type (ABO group – in some years)

Recruits are issued with 2 Dogtags (4 halves total), one remains whole and worn on a necklace, and the second is broken into its halves and placed in each military boot for the purpose of Identifying dead soldiers (IDF Military Boots contain pouches on their inner sides at the 1/3 calf height, the pouches have holes corresponding in size and placement to those on the discs, allowing for fastening, often via small cable ties).

Originally the IDF issued two circular aluminum tags (1948 – late 1950s) stamped in three lines with serial number, family name, and first name. The tags were threaded together through a single hole onto a cord worn around the neck.

=== Italy ===

Rectangular piece, 35x45 mm, designed to be broken in two. Includes soldier&#x27;s first and last name, coded date and place of birth, identification number, religious affiliation, and blood group.

=== Japan ===

Japan follows a similar system to the US Army for its Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel, and the appearance of the tags is similar, although laser etched. The exact information order is as follows.

* Japan Ground Self-Defense Force
** JAPAN GSDF
** First name, last name
** Identification number
** Blood type
* Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force
** First name, last name
** Identification number
** JAPAN MSDF
** Blood type
* Japan Air Self-Defense Force
** First name, last name
** Identification number
** JAPAN ASDF
** Blood type

=== Malaysia ===

Malaysian Armed Forces have two identical oval tags with this information:
* NRIC number (The last digit is an odd number for a male soldier, and an even number for a female soldier.)
* Service number
* Full name
* Blood type
* Religion
* Branch (e.g., TLDM)

If more information needed, another two oval wrist tags are provided. The term &quot;wrist tags&quot; can be used to refer to the bracelet-like wristwatch. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious pendant or locket; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.

=== Mexico ===

The Mexican Army uses two long identity tags, very similar to the ones used in the United States Army. They are rectangular metal tags with oval ends, embossed with name, serial number, and blood type, plus Rh factor.

=== Netherlands ===

Dutch military identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in case of a fatality; the lower end is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body.

The tags contain the following information:

* Upper half:
** Name and family name
** Service number
** Nationality and religion
** Blood group with RH factor
* Lower half: identical.

There is a difference in the Army and Air Force service number and the Navy service number:
*The Army and Air Force service number is made up of the date of birth in YY.MM.DD. format, for example 83.01.15, and a three-digit number, such as 123.
*The Navy service number is made up out of random five- or six-digit numbers.

=== Norway ===

Norwegian dog tags are designed to be broken in two like the Canadian and the Dutch version:

* The top half contains the nationality, the eleven-digit birth number and the blood type.
* The bottom half contains the nationality and birth number and has a hole so the broken-off half can be hung on a ring.

=== Poland ===


The first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design (dubbed &quot;kapala&quot; in Polish, more properly called &quot;kapsel legitymacyjny&quot; – meaning &quot;identification cap&quot;) consisted of a tin-made 30×50 mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. Soldiers&#x27; details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.

In 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by gen. bryg. , Poland&#x27;s representative at the International Red Cross. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of Nieśmiertelnik wz. 1931 (lit. &quot;Immortalizer, pattern 1931&quot;). The new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminum alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 millimeters. There were two rectangular holes in the middle to allow for easier breaking of the into halves. The halves contained the same set of data – name, religion, place of birth, year of birth – and were identical, except the upper half had two holes for a string or twine to go through, and the lower had one hole.

The 2008 pattern (wz. 2008) specifies two Stadium-shaped 0.8mm-thick 51×27mm tags with a 3mm hole, made of heat-resistant steel, engraved with:

* first name
* surname
* PESEL (the national ID number)
* &quot;a blank line&quot;
* blood type

parallel to the long axis, and the name of Polish Army &quot;Siły Zbrojne RP&quot; and the Polish coat of arms on the rounded end opposite the hole.

The 2024 pattern (wz. 2024) returns to a single 40×50mm ellipsis with 2+1 holes, of stainless steel, 1mm thick, laser-engraved, indented across the short axis with two rectangular holes to break apart, with each half containing

* first name
* surname
* second line of double-barrelled surname
* PESEL

and

* &quot;Siły zbrojne RP&quot;
* religion (on user request)
* blood type
* serial number

on the obverse. The halves are flipped with respect to each other, such that when unbroken, both sides contain all information.

=== Rhodesia ===

The former Republic of Rhodesia used two WW2 British-style compressed asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (grey) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) tag, stamped with identical information. The red tag was supposedly fireproof and the grey tag rotproof. The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, &amp; Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse. The air force and BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.

=== Russia ===

The Russian Armed Forces use oval metal tags, similar to the dog tags of the Soviet Army. Each tag contains the title and the individual&#x27;s alphanumeric number, as shown on the photo.

=== Singapore ===

The Singapore Armed Forces-issued dog tags are inscribed (not embossed) with up to four items:
* NRIC number
* Blood type
* Religion
* Drug allergies (if any; inscribed on the reverse)

The dog tags consist of two metal pieces, one oval with two holes and one round with one hole. A synthetic lanyard is threaded through both holes in the oval piece and tied around the wearer&#x27;s neck. The round piece is tied to the main loop on a shorter loop.

=== South Africa ===

The South African National Defence Force use two long, rectangular stainless steel tags with oval ends, stamped with :
* Serial number
* Name and initials
* Religion
* Blood type.

=== South Korea ===

The South Korean army issues two long, rectangular tags with oval ends, stamped (in Korean lettering). The tags are worn on the neck with a ball chain. The tags contain the information listed below:
* Branch (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines)
* Service Number; the first two digits state the starting year of service and the other eight digits state the specific unit of the person.
* Name
* Blood group followed by Rh factor

=== South Vietnam ===

The South Vietnamese Army and the South Vietnamese Navy used two American-style dog tags. Some tags added religion on the back, e.g., Phật Giáo for Buddhist. They were stamped or inscribed with: 
*Name
*SQ (Số Quân, i.e., Service number) a 2-digit year number, followed by a military serial number
*LM (loại máu, i.e., Blood Group, rH factor)

=== Soviet Union ===

During World War II, the Red Army did not issue metal dog tags to its troops. They were issued small black Bakelite cylinders containing a slip of paper with a soldier&#x27;s particulars written on it. These do not hold up as well as metal dog tags.
After World War II, the Soviet Army used oval metal tags, similar to today&#x27;s dog tags of the Russian Armed forces. Each tag contains the title and the individual&#x27;s alphanumeric number.

=== Spain ===

Issues a single metal oval, worn vertically, stamped &quot;&quot; above and below the 3-slot horizontal break line. It is stamped in 4 lines with:

* 1st line – Religion
* 2nd line – left side = blood group, right side = any medical allergies (SI or NO)
* 3rd line – military service (ET, EA ...)
* 4th (longest) line = DNI military number. 

=== Sweden ===

Swedish identification tags are designed to be able to break apart. The information on them was prior to 2010 and are as follows:

* Personal identity number (twice, once in the upper part and once below)
* Surname
*first and middle name(s)
* Residence at birth
* Blood type (only on some)
*County code
*Issue year

Swedish dog tags issued to Armed Forces personnel after 2010 are, for personal security reasons, only marked with a personal identity number.

During the Cold War, dog tags were issued to everyone, often soon after birth, since the threat of total war also meant the risk of severe civilian casualties. However, in 2010, the Government decided that the dog tags were not needed anymore.

=== Switzerland ===

Swiss Armed Forces ID tag is an oval shaped non reflective plaque, containing the following information:

* Social insurance number
* Surname
* First name
* Date of birth in DD.MM.YY format

On the back side the letters CH (standing for &quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot;) are engraved next to a Swiss cross.

=== United Kingdom ===

The British Armed Forces currently use two circular non-reflecting stainless steel tags, referred to as &quot;ID Disks&quot;, engraved with the following &#x27;Big 5&#x27; details:

# Blood group
# Service Number
# Last name (Surname)
# Initials
# Religion (Abbreviated, e.g.; R.C – Roman Catholic) 
# Branch (&quot;RAF&quot; – only for RAF members)

The discs are suspended from one long chain (24 inches long) and one short chain (4.5 inches long)

During World War One and Two, service personnel were issued pressed fibre identity disks, one green octagonal shaped disc, and a red round disc (some army units issued a second red round disc to be attached to the service respirator). The identity disks were hand stamped with the surname, initials, service number and religion of the holder and if in the Royal Air Force, the initials RAF. The disks were worn around the neck on a 38&quot; length of cotton cord, this was often replaced by the wearer with a leather bootlace. One tag was suspended below the main tag.

The fibre identity disks in the RAF were still in use in 1999.

From 1960 these were replaced with stainless steel ID tags on a green nylon cord, two circular and one oval. The oval was withdrawn around 1990.

=== United States ===


Tags are properly known as identification tags; the term &quot;dog tags&quot; has never been used in regulations.

The U.S. Armed Forces typically carry two identical oval dog tags containing:

;U.S. Air Force (Pre-2019)
* Last name
* First name and middle initial
* Social Security number (Or DoD ID number post-2012), followed by &quot;AF&quot; indicating branch of service
* Blood Group
* Religion

;U.S. Air Force (Modern)
* Last name
*First name and middle initial
*DoD ID number without hyphens
*Blood group and Rh factor
*Religious Preference

;U.S. Marine Corps
* Last name
* First and middle initials and suffix; blood group
* EDIPI number
* Branch (&quot;USMC&quot;); Gas mask size (S – small, M – medium, L – large)
* Religious preference, or medical allergy if red medical tag

;U.S. Navy (Historic, the U.S. Navy no longer issues dog tags)
* Last name, first name, middle initial
* Social Security number with no dashes or spaces followed immediately by &quot;USN&quot;, space, blood group
* Religion

;U.S. Army
* Last name
* First name and middle initial
* Dept of Defense ID number (replaced Social Security number in November 2015)
* Blood type
* Religion

;U.S. Coast Guard (Historic, the U.S. Coast Guard no longer issues dog tags)
* Last name, first name, middle initial
* Social Security number, no dashes or spaces, followed immediately by &quot;USCG&quot;
* Blood group
* Religion

==== Religious designation ====

During World War II, an American dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: &quot;P&quot; for Protestant, &quot;C&quot; for Catholic, or &quot;H&quot; for Jewish (from the word &quot;Hebrew&quot;), or (according to at least one source) &quot;NO&quot; to indicate no religious preference. Army regulations (606–5) soon included X and Y in addition to P, C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion.
By the time of the Vietnam War, some IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as &quot;METHODIST&quot; or &quot;BAPTIST&quot;. Tags did vary by service, however, such as the use of &quot;CATH&quot; instead of &quot;CATHOLIC&quot; on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words &quot;NO PREFERENCE&quot; or &quot;NO RELIGIOUS PREF&quot; (or the abbreviation &quot;NO PREF&quot;) were included.

Although American dog tags currently include the recipient&#x27;s religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are anti-Semitic. Additionally, when American troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War there were allegations that some U.S. military authorities were pressuring Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags.

<text>The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player&#x27;s hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world&#x27;s oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.

Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.

==Uses==
Drums are usually played by striking with the hand, a beater attached to a pedal, or with one or two sticks with or without padding. A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound. In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people. In the 2000s, drums have also been used as a way to engage in aerobic exercise and is called cardio drumming.

In popular music and jazz, &quot;drums&quot; usually refers to a drum kit or a set of drums (with some cymbals, or in the case of harder rock music genres, many cymbals), and &quot;drummer&quot; to the person who plays them.

Drums acquired even divine status in places such as Burundi, where the &quot;karyenda&quot; was a symbol of the power of the king.

==Construction==

The shell almost always has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the Western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells. Other shapes include a frame design (tar, Bodhrán), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined truncated cones (talking drum).

A drum contains cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.

On modern band and orchestral drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a &quot;counterhoop&quot; (or &quot;rim&quot;), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called &quot;tension rods&quot; that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head&#x27;s tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables—including shape, shell size and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead tension, drum position, location, and striking velocity and angle.

Prior to the invention of tension rods, drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems—as on the Djembe—or pegs and ropes such as on Ewe drums. These methods are rarely used today, though sometimes appear on regimental marching band snare drums. The head of a talking drum, for example, can be temporarily tightened by squeezing the ropes that connect the top and bottom heads. Similarly, the tabla is tuned by hammering a disc held in place around the drum by ropes stretching from the top to bottom head. Orchestral timpani can be quickly tuned to precise pitches by using a foot pedal.

==Sounds==
Several factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape and construction of the drum shell, the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. For example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched.

The drum head has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high frequency harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more, while drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones. Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.

The second biggest factor that affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and tightened down with tension rods, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.

The type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.

==History==
Drums made with alligator skins have been found in Neolithic cultures located in China, dating to a period of 5500–2350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies.

The bronze Dong Son drum was fabricated by the Bronze Age Dong Son culture of northern Vietnam. They include the ornate Ngoc Lu drum.

===Animal drumming===
Macaque monkeys drum objects in a rhythmic way to show social dominance and this has been shown to be processed in a similar way in their brains to vocalizations, suggesting an evolutionary origin to drumming as part of social communication. Other primates including gorillas make drumming sounds by chest beating or hand clapping, and rodents such as kangaroo rats also make similar sounds using their paws on the ground.

===Talking drums===

Drums are used not only for their musical qualities, but also as a means of communication over great distances. The talking drums of Africa are used to imitate the tone patterns of spoken language. Throughout Sri Lankan history drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years.

===Drums in art===

Drumming may be a purposeful expression of emotion for entertainment, spiritualism and communication. Many cultures practice drumming as a spiritual or religious passage and interpret drummed rhythm similarly to spoken language or prayer. Drumming has developed over millennia to be a powerful art form. Drumming is commonly viewed as the root of music and is sometimes performed as a kinesthetic dance. As a discipline, drumming concentrates on training the body to punctuate, convey and interpret musical rhythmic intention to an audience and to the performer.

===Military uses===
Chinese troops used tàigǔ drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldiers&#x27; morale is employed to change the result of a major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player&#x27;s right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that the English word &quot;drum&quot; was first used. Similarly, during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating pipe bands into their Highland regiments.

During pre-Columbian warfare, Aztec nations were known to have used drums to send signals to the battling warriors. The Nahuatl word for drum is roughly translated as &quot;huehuetl&quot;.

The Rig Veda, one of the oldest religious scriptures in the world, contains several references to the use of the &quot;Dundhubi&quot; (war drum). Arya tribes charged into battle to the beating of the war drum and chanting of a hymn that appears in Book VI of the Rig Veda and also the Atharva Veda. The dundhuhi was considered sacred and to capture one in battle would signal defeat of the enemy.

<doc id="7951" wikidata="Q75459" url="?curid=7951" title="Delphi">
<text>Delphi (; ), in legend previously called Pytho (Πυθώ), was an ancient sacred precinct and the seat of Pythia, the major oracle who was consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world. The ancient Greeks considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi (navel).

According to the Suda, Delphi took its name from the Delphyne, the she-serpent (&quot;drakaina&quot;) who lived there and was killed by the god Apollo (in other accounts the serpent was the male serpent (&quot;drakon&quot;) Python).

The sacred precinct occupies a delineated region on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus.

It is now an extensive archaeological site, and since 1938 a part of Parnassos National Park. The precinct is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in having had a great influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental Hellenic unity.

Adjacent to the sacred precinct is a small modern town of the same name.

==Names==
Delphi shares the same root with the Greek word for womb, δελφύς &quot;delphys&quot;.

Pytho (Πυθώ) is related to Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, and to Python, a serpent or dragon who lived at the site. &quot;Python&quot; is derived from the verb πύθω (&quot;pythō&quot;), &quot;to rot&quot;.

==Delphi and the Delphic region==
Today Delphi is a municipality of Greece as well as a modern town adjacent to the ancient precinct. The modern town was created after removing buildings from the sacred precinct so that the latter could be excavated. The two Delphis, old and new, are located on Greek National Road 48 between Amfissa in the west and Livadeia, capital of Voiotia, in the east. The road follows the northern slope of a pass between Mount Parnassus on the north and the mountains of the Desfina Peninsula on the south. The pass is of the river Pleistos, running from east to west, forming a natural boundary across the north of the Desfina Peninsula, and providing an easy route across it.

On the west side the valley joins the north–south valley between Amfissa and Itea.

On the north side of the valley junction a spur of Parnassus looming over the valley made narrower by it is the site of ancient Krisa, which once was the ruling power of the entire valley system. Both Amphissa and Krissa are mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&#x27;s&quot; Catalogue of Ships. It was a Mycenaean stronghold. Archaeological dates of the valley go back to the Early Helladic. Krisa itself is Middle Helladic. These early dates are comparable to the earliest dates at Delphi, suggesting Delphi was appropriated and transformed by Phocians from ancient Krisa. It is believed that the ruins of Kirra, now part of the port of Itea, were the port of Krisa of the same name.

==Archaeology of the precinct==

The site was first briefly excavated in 1880 by Bernard Haussoullier (1852–1926) on behalf of the French School at Athens, of which he was a sometime member. The site was then occupied by the village of Kastri, about 100 houses, 200 people. Kastri (&quot;fort&quot;) had been there since the destruction of the place by Theodosius I in 390. He probably left a fort to make sure it was not repopulated, however, the fort became the new village. They were mining the stone for re-use in their own buildings. British and French travelers visiting the site suspected it was ancient Delphi. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated, but the residents resisted.

The opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site. In 1893, the French Archaeological School removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of the temple to Athena, the Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions, and sculptures.

During the Great Excavation architectural members from a fifth-century Christian basilica, were discovered that date to when Delphi was a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the Roman Agora, and the large cistern. At the outskirts of the city late Roman cemeteries were located.

To the southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a building with a 65-meter-long façade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the Delphi Archaeological Museum. The mansion dates to the beginning of the fifth century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potter workshop. It is only then, in the beginning of the sixth century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished. Local pottery production is produced in large quantities: it is coarser and made of reddish clay, aiming at satisfying the needs of the inhabitants.

The Sacred Way remained the main street of the settlement, transformed, however, into a street with commercial and industrial use. Around the agora were built workshops as well as the only intra muros early Christian basilica. The domestic area spread mainly in the western part of the settlement. The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.
===Delphi Archaeological Museum===
The museum houses artifacts associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the Charioteer of Delphi, Kleobis and Biton, golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, the Sphinx of Naxos, and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul Gallio.

==Architecture of the precinct==
Most of the ruins that survive today date from the most intense period of activity at the site in the sixth century BC.

===Temple of Apollo===

Ancient tradition refers to a succession of mythical temples on the site: first one built of olive branches from Tempe, then one built of beeswax and wings by bees, and thirdly one built by Hephaestus and Athena. The first archaeologically attested structure was built in the seventh century BC and is attributed in legend to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes. It burnt down in 548/7 BC and the Alcmaeonids built a new structure which itself burnt down in the fourth century BC.

The ruins of the Temple of Apollo that are visible today date from the fourth century BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected by Spintharus, Xenodoros, and Agathon.
===Treasuries===

From the entrance of the upper site, continuing up the slope on the Sacred Way almost to the Temple of Apollo, are a large number of votive statues, and numerous so-called treasuries. These were built by many of the Greek city-states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice, which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a &quot;tithe&quot; or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored Athenian Treasury, built to commemorate their victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.

The Siphnian Treasury was dedicated by the city of Siphnos, whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.

One of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Having built it in the late classical period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place at Delphi amongst the other city-states. Completed in 380 BC, their treasury seems to draw inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.

Other identifiable treasuries are those of the Sicyonians, the Boeotians, Massaliots, and the Thebans.
===Altar of the Chians===

Located in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of Chios. It is dated to the fifth century BC by the inscription on its cornice. Made entirely of black marble, except for the base and cornice, the altar would have made a striking impression. It was restored in 1920.

===Stoa of the Athenians===
The stoa, or open-sided, covered porch, is placed in an approximately east–west alignment along the base of the polygonal wall retaining the terrace on which the Temple of Apollo sits. There is no archaeological suggestion of a connection to the temple. The stoa opened to the Sacred Way. The nearby presence of the Treasury of the Athenians suggests that this quarter of Delphi was used for Athenian business or politics, as stoas are generally found in market-places.

Although the architecture at Delphi is generally Doric, a plain style, in keeping with the Phocian traditions that were Doric, the Athenians did not prefer the Doric. The stoa was built in their own preferred style, the Ionic order, the capitals of the columns being a sure indicator. In the Ionic order they are floral and ornate, although not so much as the Corinthian, which is in deficit there. The remaining porch structure contains seven fluted columns, unusually carved from single pieces of stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined). The inscription on the stylobate indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478 BC, to house their war trophies. At that time the Athenians and the Spartans were on the same side.

The Sibyl rock is a pulpit-like outcrop of rock between the Athenian Treasury and the Stoa of the Athenians upon the Sacred Way that leads up to the temple of Apollo in the archaeological area of Delphi. The rock is claimed to be the location from which a prehistoric Sibyl pre-dating the Pythia of Apollo sat to deliver her prophecies. Other suggestions are that the Pythia might have stood there, or an acolyte whose function was to deliver the final prophecy. The rock seems ideal for public speaking.
===Theatre===
The ancient theatre at Delphi was built farther up the hill from the Temple of Apollo giving spectators a view of the entire sanctuary and the valley below. It was originally built in the fourth century BC, but was remodeled on several occasions, particularly in 160/159 B.C. at the expenses of king Eumenes II of Pergamon and, in 67 A.D., on the occasion of emperor Nero&#x27;s visit.

The koilon (cavea) leans against the natural slope of the mountain whereas its eastern part overrides a little torrent that led the water of the fountain Cassotis right underneath the temple of Apollo. The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring seven meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of manumission inscriptions recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the deity. The koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only eight. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate approximately 4,500 spectators.

On the occasion of Nero&#x27;s visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its façade was decorated in relief with scenes from myths about Hercules. Further repairs and transformations took place in the second century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus. In antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests that formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period. The theatre was abandoned when the sanctuary declined in Late Antiquity. After its excavation and initial restoration it hosted theatrical performances during the Delphic Festivals organized by A. Sikelianos and his wife, Eva Palmer, in 1927 and in 1930. It has recently been restored again as the serious landslides posed a grave threat for its stability for decades.

===Tholos===


The tholos at the sanctuary of Athena Pronaea (Ἀθηνᾶ Προναία, &quot;Athena of forethought&quot;) is a circular building that was constructed between 380 and 360 BC. It consisted of 20 Doric columns arranged with an exterior diameter of 14.76 meters, with 10 Corinthian columns in the interior.

The Tholos is located approximately a half a mile (800 m) from the main ruins at Delphi (at ). Three of the Doric columns have been restored, making it the most popular site at Delphi for tourists to take photographs.

The architect of the &quot;vaulted temple at Delphi&quot; is named by Vitruvius, in &quot;De architectura&quot; Book VII, as Theodorus Phoceus (not Theodorus of Samos, whom Vitruvius names separately).

===Gymnasium===
The gymnasium, which is half a mile away from the main sanctuary, was a series of buildings used by the youth of Delphi. The building consisted of two levels: a stoa on the upper level providing open space, and a palaestra, pool, and baths on lower floor. These pools and baths were said to have magical powers, and imparted the ability to communicate directly to Apollo.

===Stadium===
The stadium is located farther up the hill, beyond the &quot;via sacra&quot; and the theatre. It was built in the fifth century BC, but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodelling took place in the second century AD under the patronage of Herodes Atticus when the stone seating was built and an (arched) entrance created. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was 177 metres long and 25.5 metres wide.

===Hippodrome===
It was at the Pythian Games that prominent political leaders, such as Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sikyon, and Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse, competed with their chariots. The hippodrome where these events took place was referred to by Pindar, and this monument was sought by archaeologists for over two centuries.

Traces of it have recently been found at Gonia in the plain of Krisa in the place where the original stadium had been sited.

===Polygonal wall===

A retaining wall was built to support the terrace housing the construction of the second temple of Apollo in 548 BC. Its name is taken from the polygonal masonry of which it is constructed. At a later date, from 200 BC onwards, the stones were inscribed with the manumission (liberation) contracts of slaves who were consecrated to Apollo. Approximately a thousand manumissions are recorded on the wall.

===Castalian spring===
The sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the Archaic period and the Roman, with the latter cut into the rock.

===Roman Agora===
The first set of remains that the visitor sees upon entering the archaeological site of Delphi is the Roman Agora, which was just outside the &quot;peribolos&quot;, or precinct walls, of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman Agora was built between the sanctuary and the Castalian Spring, approximately 500 meters away. This large rectangular paved square used to be surrounded by Ionic porticos on its three sides. The square was built in the Roman period, but the remains visible at present along the north and northwestern sides date to the Late Antique period.

An open market was probably established, where the visitors would buy ex-votos, such as statuettes and small tripods, to leave as offerings to the gods. It also served as an assembly area for processions during sacred festivals.

During the empire, statues of the emperor and other notable benefactors were erected here as evidenced by the remaining pedestals. In late, Antiquity workshops of artisans were also created within the agora.

===Athletic statues===

Delphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues. Kleobis and Biton, two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother&#x27;s cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera&#x27;s temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.

The Charioteer of Delphi is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.

==Myths regarding the origin of the precinct==
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Achilles would not accept Agamemnon&#x27;s peace offering even if it included all the wealth in the &quot;stone floor&quot; of &quot;rocky Pytho&quot; (I 404). In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (θ 79) Agamemnon crosses a &quot;stone floor&quot; to receive a prophecy from Apollo in Pytho, the first known of proto-history. Hesiod also refers to Pytho &quot;in the hollows of Parnassus&quot; (Theogony 498). These references imply that the earliest date of the oracle&#x27;s existence is the eighth century BC, the probable date of composition of the Homeric works.

The main myths of Delphi are given in three literary &quot;loci&quot;. H. W. Parke, the Delphi scholar, argued that the myths are self-contradictory, thereby aligning with the Plutarchian epistemology that these myths are not to be taken as literal historical accounts but as symbolic narratives meant to explain oracular traditions.&quot; Parke asserts that there is no Apollo, no Zeus, no Hera, and certainly never was a great, serpent-like monster, and that the myths are pure Plutarchian figures of speech, meant to be aetiologies of some oracular tradition.

Homeric Hymn 3, &quot;To Apollo&quot;, is the oldest of the three loci, dating to the seventh century BC (estimate). Apollo travels about after his birth on Delos seeking a place for an oracle. He is advised by Telephus to choose Crissa &quot;below the glade of Parnassus&quot;, which he does, and has a temple built, having killed the serpent that guards the spring. Subsequently, some Cretans from Knossos sail up on a mission to reconnoitre Pylos. Changing into a dolphin, Apollo casts himself on deck. The Cretans do not dare to remove him but sail on. Apollo guides the ship around Greece, ending back at Crisa, where the ship grounds. Apollo enters his shrine with the Cretans to be its priests, worshipping him as &quot;Delphineus&quot;, &quot;of the dolphin&quot;.

Zeus, a Classical deity, reportedly determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his &quot;Grandmother Earth&quot; (Gaia). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the omphalos, or navel of Gaia was found.

According to Aeschylus in the prologue of the &quot;Eumenides&quot;, the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of Gaia, a view echoed by H. W. Parke, who described the evolution of beliefs associated with the site. He established that the prehistoric foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, Aeschylus in the prologue to the &quot;Eumenides&quot;, and Euripides in a chorus in the &quot;Iphigeneia in Tauris&quot;. Parke goes on to say, &quot;This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of Earth. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot;, a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot;, as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of Dodona: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats... [he continues on p. 6] ...Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the &#x27;navel&#x27; (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by Zeus who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place&quot;. On p. 7 he writes further, &quot;So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. Themis, who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity that Aeschylus recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; represents him – a northern intruder – and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.

One tale of the sanctuary&#x27;s discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.

The Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo recalled that the ancient name of this site had been &quot;Krisa&quot;.

Others relate that the site was named Pytho (Πυθώ) and that Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, was chosen from their ranks by the priestesses who officiated at the temple. Apollo was said to have slain Python, a &quot;drako&quot; (a male serpent or a dragon) who lived there and protected the navel of the Earth. &quot;Python&quot; (derived from the verb πύθω (&quot;pythō&quot;), &quot;to rot&quot;) is claimed by some to be the original name of the site in recognition of Python that Apollo defeated.

The name &quot;Delphi&quot; comes from the same root as δελφύς &quot;delphys&quot;, &quot;womb&quot; and may indicate archaic veneration of Gaia at the site. Several other scholars discuss the likely prehistoric beliefs associated with the site.

Apollo is connected with the site by his epithet Δελφίνιος &quot;Delphinios&quot;, &quot;the Delphinian&quot;. The epithet is connected with dolphins (Greek δελφίς,-ῖνος) in the Homeric &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; (line 400), recounting the legend of how Apollo first came to Delphi in the shape of a dolphin, carrying Cretan priests on his back. The Homeric name of the oracle is &quot;Pytho&quot; (Πυθώ). Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at Tempe, a city in Thessaly, to pick laurel (also known as bay tree) which he considered to be a sacred plant. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the Pythian Games received a wreath of laurel picked in the temple.

==Oracle of Delphi==
===The prophetic process===

Perhaps Delphi is best known for its oracle, the Pythia, or sibyl, the priestess prophesying from the tripod in the sunken adyton of the Temple of Apollo. The Pythia was known as a spokesperson for Apollo. She was a woman of blameless life chosen from the peasants of the area. Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek &quot;adyton&quot; – &quot;do not enter&quot;) she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the &quot;chasm&quot;). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapors, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the Hyperboreans. Dionysus would inhabit the temple during his absence. Of note, release of fumes is limited in colder weather.

The time to consult Pythia for an oracle during the year was determined from astronomical and geological grounds related to the constellations of Lyra and Cygnus. Similar practice was followed in other Apollo oracles too.

Hydrocarbon vapors emitted from the chasm. While in a trance the Pythia &quot;raved&quot; – probably a form of ecstatic speech – and her ravings were &quot;translated&quot; by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters. It has been speculated that the ancient writers, including Plutarch who had worked as a priest at Delphi, were correct in attributing the oracular effects to the sweet-smelling &quot;pneuma&quot; (Ancient Greek for breath, wind, or vapor) escaping from the chasm in the rock. That exhalation could have been high in the known anaesthetic and sweet-smelling ethylene or other hydrocarbons such as ethane known to produce violent trances. Although, given the limestone geology, this theory remains debatable, the authors put up a detailed answer to their critics.

Ancient sources describe the priestess using &quot;laurel&quot; to inspire her prophecies. Several alternative plant candidates have been suggested including Cannabis, Hyoscyamus, Rhododendron, and Oleander. Harissis claims that a review of contemporary toxicological literature indicates that oleander causes symptoms similar to those shown by the Pythia, and his study of ancient texts shows that oleander was often included under the term &quot;laurel&quot;. The Pythia may have chewed oleander leaves and inhaled their smoke prior to her oracular pronouncements and sometimes dying from the toxicity. The toxic substances of oleander resulted in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the &quot;sacred disease&quot;, which may have been seen as the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo.

===Influence, devastations and a temporary revival===
The Delphic oracle exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world, and she was consulted before all major undertakings including wars and the founding of colonies. She also was respected by the Greek-influenced countries around the periphery of the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt.

The oracle was also known to the early Romans. Rome&#x27;s seventh and last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, after witnessing a snake near his palace, sent a delegation including two of his sons to consult the oracle.

In 278 BC, a Thracian (Celtic) tribe raided Delphi, burned the temple, plundered the sanctuary and stole the &quot;unquenchable fire&quot; from the altar. During the raid, part of the temple roof collapsed. The same year, the temple was severely damaged by an earthquake, thus it fell into decay and the surrounding area became impoverished. The sparse local population led to difficulties in filling the posts required. The oracle&#x27;s credibility waned due to doubtful predictions.

The oracle flourished again in the second century AD, during the rule of emperor Hadrian, who is believed to have visited the oracle twice and offered complete autonomy to the city. By the 4th century, Delphi had acquired the status of a city.

Constantine the Great looted several monuments in Eastern Mediterranean, including Delphi, to decorate his new capital, Constantinople. One of those famous items was the bronze column of Plataea (The Serpent Column; Ancient Greek: Τρικάρηνος Ὄφις, Three-headed Serpent; Turkish: Yılanlı Sütun, Serpentine Column) from the sanctuary (dated 479 BC), relocated there from Delphi in AD 324, which can still be seen today standing destroyed at a square of Istanbul (where once upon a time was the Hippodrome of Constantinople, built by Constantine; Ottoman Turkish: Atmeydanı &quot;Horse Square&quot;) with part of one of its heads kept in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums (İstanbul Arkeoloji Müzeleri).

Despite the rise of Christianity across the Roman Empire, the oracle remained a religious center throughout the fourth century, and the Pythian Games continued to be held at least until 424 AD; however, the decline continued. The attempt of Emperor Julian to revive polytheism did not survive his reign. Excavations have revealed a large three-aisled basilica in the city, as well as traces of a church building in the sanctuary&#x27;s gymnasium. The site was abandoned in the sixth or seventh centuries, although a single bishop of Delphi is attested in an episcopal list of the late eighth and early ninth centuries.

In modern times, the structured method of communication and forecasting known as the Delphi technique takes its name from the oracle of Delphi, although some founders and early developers of the technique considered that the adoption of the name &quot;Delphi&quot; was unfortunate and undesirable.

===Religious significance of the oracle===

Delphi became the site of a major temple to Phoebus Apollo, as well as the Pythian Games and the prehistoric oracle. Even in Roman times, hundreds of votive statues remained, described by Pliny the Younger and seen by Pausanias. Carved into the temple were three phrases: (&quot;gnōthi seautón&quot; = &quot;know thyself&quot;), (&quot;mēdén ágan&quot; = &quot;nothing in excess&quot;), and (&quot;engýa pára d&#x27;atē&quot; = &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot;). In antiquity, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece by authors such as Plato and Pausanias. Additionally, according to Plutarch&#x27;s essay on the meaning of the &quot;E at Delphi&quot;—the only literary source for the inscription—there was also inscribed at the temple a large letter E. Among other things epsilon signifies the number 5. However, ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such inscriptions. According to one pair of scholars, &quot;The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.&quot;

According to the Homeric hymn to the Pythian Apollo, Apollo shot his first arrow as an infant that effectively slew the serpent Pytho, the son of Gaia, who guarded the spot. To atone the murder of Gaia&#x27;s son, Apollo was forced to fly and spend eight years in menial service before he could return forgiven. A festival, the Septeria, was held every year, at which the whole story was represented: the slaying of the serpent, and the flight, atonement, and return of the god.

The Pythian Games took place every four years to commemorate Apollo&#x27;s victory. Another regular Delphi festival was the &quot;Theophania&quot; (Θεοφάνεια), an annual festival in spring celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea. The culmination of the festival was a display of an image of the deities, usually hidden in the sanctuary, to worshippers.

The &quot;theoxenia&quot; was held each summer, centred on a feast for &quot;gods and ambassadors from other states&quot;. Myths indicate that Apollo killed the chthonic serpent Python guarding the Castalian Spring and named his priestess Pythia after her. Python, who had been sent by Hera, had attempted to prevent Leto, while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth.

The spring at the site flowed toward the temple but disappeared beneath, creating a cleft which emitted chemical vapors that purportedly caused the oracle at Delphi to reveal her prophecies. Apollo killed Python, but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. The shrine dedicated to Apollo was originally dedicated to Gaia and shared with Poseidon. The name Pythia remained as the title of the Delphic oracle.

Erwin Rohde wrote that the Python was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo, and buried under the omphalos, and that it is a case of one deity setting up a temple on the grave of another. Another view holds that Apollo was a fairly recent addition to the Greek pantheon coming originally from Lydia.

==History==
Occupation of the site at Delphi can be traced back to the Neolithic period with extensive occupation and use beginning in the Mycenaean period (1600–1100 BC). In Mycenaean times Krissa was a major Greek land and sea power, perhaps one of the first in Greece, if the Early Helladic date of Kirra is to be believed. The ancient sources indicate that the previous name of the Gulf of Corinth was the &quot;Krisaean Gulf&quot;. Like Krisa, Corinth was a Dorian state, and Gulf of Corinth was a Dorian lake, so to speak, especially since the migration of Dorians into the Peloponnesus starting about 1000 BC. Krisa&#x27;s power was broken finally by the recovered Aeolic and Attic-Ionic speaking states of southern Greece over the issue of access to Delphi. Control of it was assumed by the Amphictyonic League, an organization of states with an interest in Delphi, in the early Classical period. Krisa was destroyed for its arrogance. The gulf was given Corinth&#x27;s name. Corinth by then was similar to the Ionic states: ornate and innovative, not resembling the spartan style of the Doric.

===Ancient Delphi===
Earlier myths include traditions that Pythia, or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400 BC) and, rededicated from about 800 BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god Apollo.
Delphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the seventh century BC. Initially under the control of Phocian settlers based in nearby Kirra (currently Itea), Delphi was reclaimed by the Athenians during the First Sacred War (597–585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the Amphictyonic League, which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the Temple of Apollo. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the Alcmaeonids who were banned from Athens. In 449–448 BC, the Second Sacred War (fought in the wider context of the First Peloponnesian War between the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta and the Delian-Attic League led by Athens) resulted in the Phocians gaining control of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games.

In 356 BC, the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the Third Sacred War (356–346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the rise of Macedon under the reign of Philip II. This led to the Fourth Sacred War (339 BC), which culminated in the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.

In Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the Aetolians in 279 BC, when a Gallic invasion was repelled, and by the Romans in 191 BC. The site was sacked by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 86 BC, during the Mithridatic Wars, and by Nero in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the Flavian dynasty contributed toward to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance.

The anti-pagan legislation of the late Roman Imperial era deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets. The emperor Julian attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his &quot;pagan revival&quot; was particularly short-lived. When the doctor Oreibasius visited the oracle of Delphi, in order to question the fate of paganism, he received a pessimistic answer:

Tell the king that the flute has fallen to the ground. Phoebus does not have a home any more, neither an oracular laurel, nor a speaking fountain, because the talking water has dried out

It was shut down during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire by Theodosius I in 381 AD.

===Amphictyonic Council===
The Amphictyonic Council was a council of representatives from six Greek tribes who controlled Delphi and also the quadrennial Pythian Games. They met biannually and came from Thessaly and central Greece. Over time, the town of Delphi gained more control of itself and the council lost much of its influence.

===The sacred precinct in the Iron Age===

Excavation at Delphi, which was a post-Mycenaean settlement of the late ninth century BC, has uncovered artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with the last quarter of the eighth century BC. Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to Olympia. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.

Apollo&#x27;s sacred precinct in Delphi was a Panhellenic Sanctuary, where every four years, starting in 586 BC athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the Pythian Games, one of the four Panhellenic Games, precursors of the Modern Olympics. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (&quot;stephanos&quot;) that was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python. (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.

These Pythian Games rank second among the four stephantic games chronologically and in importance. These games, however, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city regardless of whether it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the &quot;omphalos&quot; (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.

In the inner &quot;hestia&quot; (hearth) of the Temple of Apollo, an eternal flame burned. After the battle of Plataea, the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the foundation stories of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.

===Abandonment and rediscovery===
The Ottomans finalized their domination over Phocis and Delphi in about 1410 AD. Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the Dormition of Mary or of Panagia (the Mother of God) built above the ancient gymnasium at Delphi. It must have been toward the end of the fifteenth or in the sixteenth century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of Kastri.

Ottoman Delphi gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was Cyriacus of Ancona, a fifteenth-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian, considered the founding father of modern classical archeology. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on Pausanias for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some freestanding pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications, however, were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the temple of Apollo while this was simply the base of the Argives&#x27; ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.

In 1766, an English expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti included the Oxford epigraphist Richard Chandler, the architect Nicholas Revett, and the painter William Pars. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title &quot;Ionian Antiquities&quot;, followed by a collection of inscriptions, and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775), and one about Greece (1776). Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Muslim Albanians who guarded the mountain passes.

In 1805 Edward Dodwell visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi. Lord Byron visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend John Cam Hobhouse:

Yet there I&#x27;ve wandered by the vaulted rill
Yes! Sighed o&#x27;er Delphi&#x27;s long deserted shrine,
where, save that feeble fountain, all is still.

He carved his name on the same column in the gymnasium as Lord Aberdeen, later Prime Minister, who had visited a few years before. Proper excavation did not start until the late nineteenth century (see &quot;Excavations&quot; section) after the village had moved.

==Delphi in later art==

From the sixteenth century onward, woodcuts of Delphi began to appear in printed maps and books. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary; for example, those created by Nikolaus Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.

The first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British George Wheler and the French Jacob Spon, who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675–1676. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler&#x27;s &quot;Journey into Greece&quot;, published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Delphi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon&#x27;s publication &quot;Voyage d&#x27;Italie, de Dalmatie, de Grèce et du Levant, 1678&quot; are considered original and groundbreaking.

Travelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the nineteenth century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, and views of the site, as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (&quot;La Grèce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques&quot;, Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (&quot;Costumes et usages des peuples de la Grèce moderne dessinés sur les lieux&quot;, Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). Influential personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.

After the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press became also interested in these travelers. Thus &quot;Ephemeris&quot; writes (17 March 1889):
In the &quot;Revues des Deux Mondes&quot; Paul Lefaivre published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. &quot;In Arachova the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear.&quot; Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80 meters long, &quot;on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions&quot;.

Gradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary &quot;pocket&quot; books invented by Karl Baedeker, accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onward, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.

Delphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, Pythia and Sibylla become illustration subjects even on Tarot cards. A famous example constitutes Michelangelo&#x27;s Delphic Sibyl (1509), the nineteenth-century German engraving, Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the recent ink on paper drawing, &quot;The Oracle of Delphi&quot; (2013) by M. Lind.
Modern artists are inspired also by the Delphic Maxims. Examples of such works are displayed in the &quot;Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi&quot; and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.

==Delphi in later literature==

Delphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work &quot;Greece, a Poem&quot;. In 1888 Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle published his lyric drama L’Apollonide, accompanied by music by Franz Servais. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as Yves Bonnefoy (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of Joseph Lemarchand) in L&#x27;Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also Rob MacGregor&#x27;s Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi (1991).

The presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as Kostis Palamas (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), Kostas Karyotakis (Delphic festival, 1927), Nikephoros Vrettakos (return from Delphi, 1957), Yannis Ritsos (Delphi, 1961–62) and Kiki Dimoula (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. Angelos Sikelianos wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay entitled &quot;The Delphic union&quot; (1930). The nobelist George Seferis wrote an essay under the title &quot;Delphi&quot;, in the book &quot;Dokimes&quot;.

<text>Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC ), using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until he was forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.

The company produced many different product lines over its history. It is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the early 1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX &quot;supermini&quot; systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company&#x27;s place as a leading vendor in the computer space. As microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded. 

By the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson Fab were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. Compaq subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002.

==History==
=== Origins (1944–1958) ===

Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson were two engineers who had been working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the lab&#x27;s various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as &quot;interactivity&quot;, and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed Whirlwind, which was originally developed to make a flight simulator for the US Navy, although this was never completed. Instead, this effort evolved into the SAGE system for the US Air Force, which used large screens and light guns to allow operators to interact with radar data stored in the computer.

When the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using transistors in place of vacuum tubes. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small 18-bit machine known as TX-0, which first ran in 1956. When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the 36-bit TX-2 with a then-enormous 64 kWords of core memory. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0&#x27;s memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to MIT on permanent loan.

At MIT, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster IBM machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where the graphical output or real-time operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine would not be needed.

In 1957, when the pair and Ken&#x27;s brother Stan sought capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like RCA and General Electric were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from Georges Doriot and his American Research and Development Corporation (AR&amp;D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from &quot;Digital Computer Corporation&quot;.

The pair returned with an updated business plan that outlined two phases for the company&#x27;s development. They would start by selling computer modules as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these &quot;digital modules&quot; were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their Phase II. The newly christened &quot;Digital Equipment Corporation&quot; received $70,000 from AR&amp;D for a 70% share of the company, and began operations in a Civil War-era textile mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available.

=== Digital modules (1958) ===

In early 1958, DEC shipped its first products, the &quot;Digital Laboratory Module&quot; line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and germanium transistors mounted to a circuit board, the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.

The Laboratory Modules were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing, intended to sit on an engineer&#x27;s workbench, although a rack-mount bay was sold that held nine laboratory modules. They were then connected together using banana plug patch cords inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), or 10 MHz (1960). The Modules proved to be in high demand by other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone (), turning a profit at the end of its first year.

The original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the &quot;Digital System Module&quot; line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by plugging them into a backplane that could be mounted in a 19-inch rack. The backplanes allowed 25 modules in a single 5-1/4 inch section of rack, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.

The original laboratory and system module lines were offered in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions. In all cases, the supply voltages were -15 and +10 volts, with logic levels of -3 volts (passive pull-down) and 0 volts (active pull-up).

DEC used the System Modules to build their &quot;Memory Test&quot; machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years. The PDP-1 and LINC computers were also built using System Modules (see below).

Modules were part of DEC&#x27;s product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first &quot;R&quot; (red) series &quot;Flip-Chip&quot; modules. Later, other Flip-Chip module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities. DEC published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.

=== PDP-1 family (1960) ===

With the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned &quot;Phase II&quot;. In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company&#x27;s first computer, the PDP-1. In keeping with Doriot&#x27;s instructions, the name was an initialism for &quot;Programmable Data Processor&quot;, leaving off the term &quot;computer&quot;. As Gurley put it, &quot;We aren&#x27;t building computers, we&#x27;re building &#x27;Programmable Data Processors&#x27;.&quot; The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959. The first PDP-1 was delivered to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in November 1960, and formally accepted the next April. The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000 (). By the time production ended in 1969, 53 PDP-1s had been delivered.

The PDP-1 was supplied standard with 4096 words of core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lie at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system&#x27;s standard input/output solution, a punched tape reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own punched tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic tape systems, punched card readers and punches, and faster punched tape and printer systems.

When DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36 bits, based on the same design. During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full. Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA&#x27;s Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in Waltham, Massachusetts. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft. Gordon Bell remembered that it was being used in Oregon some time later, but could not recall who was using it.

In November 1962, DEC introduced the $65,000 PDP-4. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4s were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.

In 1964, DEC introduced its new Flip Chip module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the PDP-7. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced. An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965. The PDP-7 is most famous as the machine for which the Unix operating system was originally written. Unix ran only on DEC systems until the Interdata 8/32.

A more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the PDP-9. The PDP-9 was instruction-compatible with the PDP-4 and −7, but ran about twice as fast as the −7 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968, the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.

Even while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969&#x27;s PDP-15, which re-implemented the PDP-9 using integrated circuits in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a floating point unit and a separate input/output processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15&#x27;s were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in 12 basic models. However, by this time other machines in DEC&#x27;s lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series.

=== PDP-8 family (1962) ===

In 1962, Lincoln Laboratory used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of analog-to-digital (A to D) input/output (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The LINC proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real minicomputer, a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab.

Seeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the PDP-5. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at WESTCON on August 11, 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, &quot;Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000&quot;. 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent.

On March 22, 1965, DEC introduced the PDP-8, which replaced the PDP-5&#x27;s modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the logic modules plugged into the wire-wrapped backplane of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a Teletype Model 33 ASR for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first &quot;real&quot; minicomputer because of its sub-$25,000 price. Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5&#x27;s market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership, and eventually 1450 &quot;straight eight&quot; machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.

DEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for &quot;serial&quot;. As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000. DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor LINC-8. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or &quot;upgrade&quot; to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINC-8s were sold starting at $38,500. Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor PDP-12, adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family. Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968. In 1975, one year after an agreement between DEC and Intersil, the Intersil 6100 chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the DEC PDP-8 product line.

=== PDP-6 and PDP-10 families (1963 and 1968) ===

While the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963&#x27;s PDP-6 was intended to take DEC into the mainframe market with a 36-bit machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a &quot;hard sell&quot; with customers, as it offered few obvious advantages over similar machines from the better-established vendors like IBM or Honeywell, in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold, or 26 depending on the source, and unlike other models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with successor versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced &quot;Monitor&quot;, an early time-sharing operating system that would evolve into the widely used TOPS-10.

When newer Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to refine their 36-bit design, introducing the PDP-10 in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a commercial failure; about 700 mainframe PDP-10s were sold before production ended in 1984. The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the &quot;DECsystem-10&quot;, and PDP-10s are generally referred to by the model of their CPU, starting with the &quot;KA10&quot;, soon upgraded to the &quot;KI10&quot; (I:Integrated circuit); then to &quot;KL10&quot; (L:Large-scale integration ECL logic); also the &quot;KS10&quot; (S: Small form factor). Unified product line upgrades produced the compatible DECSYSTEM-20, along with a TOPS-20 operating system that included virtual memory support.

The Jupiter Project was supposed to continue the mainframe product line into the future by using gate arrays with an innovative Air Mover Cooling System, coupled with a built-in floating point processing engine called &quot;FBOX&quot;. The design was intended for a top tier scientific computing niche, yet the critical performance measurement was based upon COBOL compilation which did not fully utilize the primary design features of Jupiter technology. When the Jupiter Project was cancelled in 1983, some of the engineers adapted aspects of the 36-bit design into a forthcoming 32-bit design, releasing the high-end VAX8600 in 1985.

=== PDP-11 (1970) ===

DEC&#x27;s successful entry into the computer market took place during a fundamental shift in the underlying organization of the machines from word lengths based on 6-bit characters to those based on 8-bit words needed to support ASCII. DEC began studies of such a machine, the PDP-X, but Ken Olsen did not support it as he could not see how it offered anything their existing 12-bit or 18-bit machines didn&#x27;t. This led the leaders of the PDP-X project to leave DEC and start Data General, whose 16-bit Data General Nova was released in 1969 and was a huge success.

The success of the Nova finally prompted DEC to take the switch seriously, and they began a crash program to introduce a 16-bit machine of their own. The new system was designed primarily by Harold McFarland, Gordon Bell, Roger Cady, and others. The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at Carnegie Mellon University. One of his simpler designs became the basis for the new design, although when they first viewed the proposal, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.

The result was the PDP-11, released in 1970. It differed from earlier designs considerably. In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and CISC designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also extended the idea of multiple &quot;General Purpose Registers&quot; (GPRs), which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues.
A major advance in the PDP-11 design was DEC&#x27;s Unibus, which supported all peripherals through memory mapping. This allowed a new device to be added easily, generally only requiring plugging a hardware interface board into the backplane and possibly adding a jumper to the wire wrapped backplane, and then installing software that read and wrote to the mapped memory to control it. The relative ease of interfacing spawned a huge market of third party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful.

The combination of architectural innovations proved superior to competitors and the &quot;11&quot; architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to a strong market position. The design was later expanded to allow paged physical memory and memory protection features, useful for multitasking and time-sharing. Some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128 KB within a physical address size of up to 4 MB. Smaller PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.

The PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including Bell Labs&#x27; new Unix operating system as well as DEC&#x27;s DOS-11, RSX-11, IAS, RT-11, DSM-11, and RSTS/E. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11&#x27;s first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose multitasking environment and supported a wide variety of programming languages. IAS was a time-sharing version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the &quot;sandbox&quot; for a rising generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of PDP-11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&amp;T Corporation became DEC&#x27;s largest customer.

RT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system in minimal memory, allowing the PDP-11 to continue DEC&#x27;s critical role as a computer supplier for embedded systems. Historically, RT-11 also served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS&#x27;s, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. For example, CP/M used a command syntax similar to RT-11&#x27;s, and even retained the awkward PIP program used to copy data from one computer device to another. As another historical footnote, DEC&#x27;s use of &quot;/&quot; for &quot;switches&quot; (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of &quot;\&quot; for pathnames in MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows as opposed to &quot;/&quot; in Unix.

The evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually including a single-user deskside personal computer form, the MicroPDP-11. In total, around 600,000 PDP-11s of all models were sold, and a wide variety of third-party peripheral vendors had also entered the computer product ecosystem. It was even sold in kit form as the Heathkit H11, although it proved too expensive for Heathkit&#x27;s traditional hobbyist market.

=== VAX (1977) ===

The introduction of semiconductor memory in the early 1970s, and especially dynamic RAM shortly thereafter, led to dramatic reductions in the price of memory as the effects of Moore&#x27;s Law were felt. Within years, it was common to equip a machine with all the memory it could address, typically 64 KB on 16-bit machines. This led vendors to introduce new designs with the ability to address more memory, often by extending the address format to 18 or 24-bits in machines were otherwise similar to their earlier 16-bit designs.

In contrast, DEC decided to make a more radical departure. In 1976, they began the design of a machine whose entire architecture was expanded from the 16-bit PDP-11 to a new 32-bit basis. This would allow the addressing of very large memories, which were to be controlled by a new virtual memory system, and would also improve performance by processing twice as much data at a time. The system would, however, maintain compatibility with the PDP-11, by operating in a second mode that sent its 16-bit words into the 32-bit internals, while mapping the PDP-11&#x27;s 16-bit memory space into the larger virtual 32-bit space.

The result was the VAX architecture, where VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension (from 16 to 32 bits). The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the VAX-11/780, announced in October 1977, which DEC referred to as a &quot;superminicomputer&quot;. Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780&#x27;s combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its Jupiter project, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as the single computer architecture for the company.

Supporting the VAX&#x27;s success was the VT52, one of the most successful smart terminals. Building on earlier less successful models, the VT05 and VT50, the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single inexpensive chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful VT100 and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. This was supported by a line of inexpensive computer printers, the DECwriter line. With the VT and DECwriter series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.

The VAX processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the NVAX microprocessor implementation and VAX 7000/10000 series in the early 1990s.

=== Early microcomputers (1982–1986) ===
When a DEC research group demonstrated two prototype microcomputers in 1974—before the debut of the MITS Altair—Olsen chose to not proceed with the project. The company similarly rejected another personal computer proposal in 1977. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating &quot;There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.&quot; Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. In 1977, the Heathkit H11 was announced; a PDP-11 in kit form. At the beginning of the 1980s, DEC built the VT180 (codenamed &quot;Robin&quot;), which was a VT100 terminal with an added Z80-based microcomputer running CP/M, but this product was initially available only to DEC employees.

It was only after IBM had successfully launched the IBM PC in 1981 that DEC responded with their own systems. In 1982, DEC introduced not one, but three incompatible machines which were each tied to different proprietary architectures. The first, the DEC Professional, was based on the PDP-11/23 (and later, the 11/73) running the RSX-11M+ derived, but menu-driven, P/OS (&quot;Professional Operating System&quot;). This DEC machine easily outperformed the PC, but was more expensive than, and completely incompatible with IBM PC hardware and software, offering far fewer options for customizing a system.

Unlike CP/M and DOS microcomputers, every copy of every program for the Professional had to be provided with a unique key for the particular machine and CPU for which it was bought. At that time this was mainstream policy, because most computer software was either bought from the company that built the computer or custom-constructed for one client. However, the emerging third-party software industry disregarded the PDP-11/Professional line and concentrated on other microcomputers where distribution was easier. At DEC itself, creating better programs for the Professional was not a priority, perhaps from fear of cannibalizing the PDP-11 line. As a result, the Professional was a superior machine, running inferior software. In addition, a new user would have to learn an awkward, slow, and inflexible menu-based user interface which appeared to be radically different from PC DOS or CP/M, which were more commonly used on the 8080- and 8088-based microcomputers of the time. A second offering, the DECmate II was the latest version of the PDP-8-based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with Wang Laboratories&#x27; popular word processing equipment.
The most popular early DEC microcomputer was the dual-processor (Z80 and 8088) Rainbow 100, which ran the 8-bit CP/M operating system on the Z80 and the 16-bit CP/M-86 operating system on the Intel 8088 processor. It could also run a UNIX System III implementation called VENIX. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but by this time users were expecting custom-built (pre-compiled binary) applications such as Lotus 1-2-3, which was eventually ported along with MS-DOS 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support. By late 1983 IBM was outselling DEC&#x27;s personal computers by more than ten to one.

A further system was introduced in 1986 as the VAXmate, which included Microsoft Windows 1.0 and used VAX/VMS-based file and print servers along with integration into DEC&#x27;s own DECnet-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow, and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation.

=== Networking and clusters (1984) ===
In 1984, DEC launched its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and VAXcluster allowed scalable computing. Combined with DECnet and Ethernet-based terminal servers (LAT), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced Token Ring, and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today.

In September 1985, DEC became the fifth company to register a .com domain name (dec.com).

Along with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the VAXcluster concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach.

=== Late 1980s diversification ===
The PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2 billion away from them in the mid-1980s. In 1986, DEC&#x27;s profits rose 38% when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM&#x27;s number one position in the computer industry. Not long thereafter came IBM&#x27;s &quot;VAX killer&quot; offerings, at a time when DEC had twice the sales of IBM in the mid-range computer market.

At its peak, DEC was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of relational databases and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like Oracle became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every &quot;hot&quot; niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC&#x27;s own partners, notably Rdb which competed with Oracle&#x27;s products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier.

Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen&#x27;s aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using RISC microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance.

=== Early 1990s faltering and attempted turnaround ===
As microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the Berkeley RISC and Stanford MIPS designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC&#x27;s cash cow.

Constrained by the huge success of their VAX and VMS products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the &quot;low end&quot; market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses.

One group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where profit margins were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the VAX 9000 series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late. The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped.

Others within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the PRISM project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation. Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC&#x27;s big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter. The PRISM project was accompanied by the MICA project, which intended to consolidate VMS and ULTRIX into a single operating system.

Another group concluded that new workstations like those from Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics would take away a large part of DEC&#x27;s existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in Palo Alto started a skunkworks project to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new DECstation series with the model 3100 on January 11, 1989. These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha.

==== 32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems (1992) ====
Eventually, in 1992, DEC launched the DECchip 21064 processor, the first implementation of their Alpha instruction set architecture, initially named Alpha AXP; the &quot;AXP&quot; was a &quot;non-acronym&quot; and was later dropped. This was a 64-bit RISC architecture as opposed to the 32-bit CISC architecture used in the VAX. It is one of the first &quot;pure&quot; 64-bit microprocessor architectures and implementations rather than an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch and was used in the massively-parallel Cray T3D. Subsequent variants continued that performance trend into the 2000s, along with the Alpha-derived Pentium Pro, II, and III CPUs. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked No. 6 in the world in November 2004. Alpha-based computers comprising the DEC AXP series, later the AlphaStation, and AlphaServer series respectively superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC&#x27;s product lines. They supported OpenVMS, DEC OSF/1 AXP (later known as Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft&#x27;s then-new operating system, Windows NT, an operating system made possible by ex-Digital Equipment Corporation engineers.

In 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computer Corporation, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers.

==== StrongARM (1995) ====
In the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with ARM Limited to produce the StrongARM microprocessor. This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at embedded systems and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the SuperH and MIPS architectures in the portable digital assistant market. Microsoft subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their Pocket PC platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the StrongARM intellectual property was sold to Intel. They continued to produce StrongARM, as well as developing it into the XScale architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to Marvell Technology Group in 2006.

=== Palmer&#x27;s reign (1992–1998) ===

At its peak in the late 1980s, DEC had $14 billion in sales and ranked among the most profitable companies in the US. With its strong staff of engineers, DEC was expected to usher in the age of personal computers, but the commonly misunderstood belief then argued by the board to its shareholders was that Mr. Olsen was openly skeptical of the desktop machines, stating &quot;the personal computer will fall flat on its face in business&quot;, and regarding them as &quot;toys&quot; used for playing video games. This was made in 1977 about what could be more characterised as home automation devices.

The board forced Olsen to resign as president in July 1992 after two years of losses in operating income. He was replaced by Robert Palmer as the company&#x27;s president. DEC&#x27;s board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer (&quot;CEO&quot;), a title that had never been used during DEC&#x27;s 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed

Palmer restructured DEC into nine business units that reported directly to him. Nonetheless, DEC continued to suffer record losses, including a loss of $260.5 million for the quarter that ended on September 30, 1992. It reported $2.8 billion in losses for its fiscal year 1992. January 5, 1993, saw the retirement of John F. Smith as senior vice president of operations, the second in command at DEC, and his position was not filled. A 35-year company veteran, he had joined DEC in 1958 as the company&#x27;s 12th employee, passing up a chance to work for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey to work for DEC. Smith rose to become one of the three senior vice presidents in 1987 and was widely considered among the potential successors to Ken Olsen, especially when Smith was appointed chief operating officer in 1991. Smith became a corporate spokesman on financial issues, and had filled in at trouble spots for which Olsen ordered more attention. Smith was passed over in favor of Palmer when Olsen was forced to resign in July 1992, though Smith stayed on for a time to help turn around the struggling company.

In June 1993, Palmer and several of his top lieutenants presented their reorganization plans to applause from the board of directors, and several weeks later DEC reported its first profitable quarter in several years. However, on April 15, 1994, DEC reported a loss of $183 million—three to four times higher than the loss many people on Wall Street had predicted (compared with a loss of $30 million in the comparable period a year earlier), causing the stock price on the NYSE to plunge $5.875 to $23, a 20% drop. The losses at that point totaled $339 million for the current fiscal year. Sales of the VAX, long the company&#x27;s biggest moneymaker, continued to decline, which in turn also hurt DEC&#x27;s lucrative service and maintenance business (this made up more than a third of DEC&#x27;s revenue of $14 billion in the 1993 fiscal year), which declined 11% year over year to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter.

Market acceptance of DEC Alpha computers and chips had been slower than the company had hoped, even though Alpha&#x27;s sales for the quarter estimated at $275 million were up significantly from $165 million in the December quarter. DEC had also made a strong push into personal computers and workstations, which had even lower margins than Alpha computers and chips. Also, DEC was playing catchup with its own Unix offerings for client-server networks, as it long emphasized its own VMS software, while corporate computer users based their client-server networks on the industry-standard Unix software (of which Hewlett Packard was one of the market leaders). DEC&#x27;s problems were similar to that of larger rival IBM, due to the fundamental shift in the computer industry that made it unlikely that DEC could ever again operate profitably at its former size of 120,000 employees, and while its workforce had been reduced to 92,000 people many analysts expected that they would have to cut another 20,000.

==== Selloffs ====

During the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff. Following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat. Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:
* Worldwide training was spun off to form an independent/new company called Global Knowledge Network.
* Rdb, DEC&#x27;s database product, was sold to Oracle.
* Rights to the PDP-11 line and several PDP-11 operating systems were sold to Mentec in 1994, though DEC continued to produce some PDP-11 hardware for a few years.
* Disk and DLT technologies was sold to Quantum Corporation in 1994.
* Text terminal business (VT100 and its successors) was sold in August 1995 to Boundless Technologies.
* CORBA-based product, ObjectBroker, and its messaging software, MessageQ, were sold to BEA Systems, Inc in March 1997.
* Printer business was sold in 1997 to GENICOM (now TallyGenicom), which then produced models bearing the Digital logo.
* Networking business was sold c.1997 to Cabletron Systems, and subsequently spun off as Digital Network Products Group.
* DECtalk and DECvoice voice products were spun off, and eventually arrived at Fonix Speech Group.

=== Acquisition by Compaq (1998) ===
Through 1997, DEC began discussions with Compaq on a possible merger. Several years earlier, Compaq had considered a bid for DEC but became seriously interested only after DEC&#x27;s major divestments and refocusing on the Internet in 1997. At that time, Compaq was making strong moves into the enterprise market, and DEC&#x27;s multivendor global services organization and customer support centers offered a real opportunity to expand their support and sales worldwide. Compaq was not interested in a number of DEC&#x27;s product lines, which led to the series of sell-offs. Notable among these was DEC&#x27;s Hudson Fab, which made most of their custom chips, a market that made little sense to Compaq&#x27;s &quot;industry standard&quot; marketing. DEC had previously sold its semiconductor plant in South Queensferry to Motorola in 1995, with an understanding that Motorola would continue to produce Alpha processors at the facility, along with continuing a two-year foundry agreement with AMD to continue producing the Am486 processor.

This led to an interesting solution to the problem of selling off the division for a reasonable profit. In May 1997, DEC sued Intel for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the original Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II chips. As part of a settlement, much of DEC&#x27;s chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC&#x27;s StrongARM implementation of the ARM computer architecture, which Intel marketed as the XScale processors commonly used in Pocket PCs. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson fab.

On January 26, 1998, what remained of the company was sold to Compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry. At the time of Compaq&#x27;s acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues. After the merger closed, Compaq moved aggressively to reduce DEC&#x27;s high selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs (equal to 24% of total 1997 revenues) and bring them more in line with Compaq&#x27;s SG&amp;A expense ratio of 12% of revenues.

Compaq used the acquisition to move into enterprise services and compete with IBM, and by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq&#x27;s revenues, largely due to the DEC employees inherited from the merger. DEC&#x27;s own PC manufacturing was discontinued after the merger closed. As Compaq did not wish to compete with one of its key partner suppliers, the remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson (Massachusetts) office, which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997.

Compaq struggled as a result of the merger with DEC, and was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former DEC products but re-branded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly DEC&#x27;s StorageWorks disk/tape products, as a result of the Compaq acquisition.

The Digital logo was used up until 2004, even after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51% subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed &quot;HP GlobalSoft&quot; (also known as the &quot;HP Global Delivery India Center&quot; or HP GDIC), and no longer uses the Digital logo.

==Research and people==
DEC&#x27;s Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC&#x27;s corporate research. Some of them were continued in operation by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the &quot;Digital Technical Journal&quot;, which was in published from 1985 until 1998. At least some of the research reports are available online.

==Legacy and accomplishments==
, decades-old hardware (including PDP-11, VAX, and AlphaServer) is being emulated to allow legacy software to run on modern hardware; funding for this is planned to last at least until 2030.

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC&#x27;s own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.

Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was known for its work in communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its &quot;dumb terminal&quot; subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.

===Software===

* The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC&#x27;s PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
* DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
* The command-line interfaces found in DEC&#x27;s systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM&#x27;s JCL, or Univac&#x27;s time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC&#x27;s OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the &quot;name-dot-extension&quot; file naming conventions.
* Notes-11 and its follow-on product, , were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers, later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
* The MUMPS programming language, with its built-in database, was developed on the PDP-7, 9, and 15 series machines. MUMPS is still widely used in medical information systems, such as those provide by Meditech and Epic Systems.
* The Babel Fish machine translation service was developed by DEC researchers, and was one of the first machine translators to achieve broad success using natural language processing techniques.
* ALL-IN-1 was an office automation system developed by Skip Walter and others in Central Engineering under Gordon Bell. They developed a customizable list of application invocations and the robust DECMail product that provided one of the first commercially available electronic mail systems.

===Hardware===
==== DECtape ====
One of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the DECtape. The DECtape was a length of special 3/4-inch wide magnetic tape wound on 5-inch reels. The recording format was a highly reliable redundant 10-track design using fixed-length numbered data &quot;blocks&quot; organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk drive. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.

In fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. The DECtape was also widely used on other PDP models, since it was much easier to use than hand-loading multiple paper tapes. Primitive early time-sharing systems could use DECtapes as system devices and swapping devices. Although superior to paper tape, DECtapes were relatively slow, and were supplanted once reliable disk drives became affordable.

==== Magnetic disk storage ====

DEC was both a manufacturer and a buyer of magnetic disk storage, offering more than 100 different models of hard disk drive (HDD) and floppy disk drive (FDD) during its existence. In the 1970s, it was the single largest OEM purchaser of HDDs, procuring from Diablo, Control Data Corporation, Information Storage Systems, and Memorex, among others.

DEC&#x27;s first internally developed HDD was the RS08, a 256 kWord fixed-head contact-start-stop drive using plated media; it shipped in 1969.

Beginning in the 1970s, DEC moved first its HDD manufacturing and then its mass storage development labs to Colorado Springs.

DEC pioneered a number of HDD technologies, including sampled data servos (RL01, 1977) and serial HDD interfaces (Standard Disk Interconnect, 1983). The last internally developed disk drive family (RA9x series) used plated media, departing from the HDD industry trend to carbon overcoated sputtered media. DEC designated a $400 million investment to bring this product line into production. The RA92 (1.5 GB) was introduced in 1992, using a 14-inch platter.

DEC purchased its FDDs from OEMs such as Shugart Associates, Toshiba, and Sony.

==== RX50 ====
The way the 400 KB DEC standard RX50 floppy disk drive supported DEC&#x27;s initial offerings seemed to encapsulate their approach to the personal computer market. Although the mechanical drive hardware was nearly identical to other 5 &quot; floppy disk drives available on competing systems, DEC sought to differentiate their product by using a proprietary disk format for the data written on the disk. The DEC format had a higher capacity for data, but the RX50 drives were incompatible with other PC floppy drives. This required DEC owners to buy higher-priced, specially formatted floppy media, which was harder to obtain through standard distribution channels. DEC attempted to enforce exclusive control over its floppy media sales by copyrighting its proprietary disk format, and requiring a negotiated license agreement and royalty payments from anybody selling compatible media. The proprietary data format meant that RX50 floppies were not interchangeable with other PC floppies, further isolating DEC products from the developing de facto standard PC market. Hardware hackers and DEC enthusiasts eventually reverse-engineered the RX50 format, but the damage had already been done, in terms of market confusion and isolation.

==== Video and Interactive Information Server ====
The Video-on-Demand project at DEC started in 1992, following Ken Olsen&#x27;s retirement. At the time the company was rapidly downsizing under Robert Palmer, and it was difficult to gain funding for any new project. DEC&#x27;s Interactive Video Information Server architecture gained traction and excelled over those of other companies, in that it was highly scalable, using a gateway to set up interactive video delivery sessions on large numbers of video and information servers. Initially high-end VAXes were used, then Alphas.
The scalability feature allowed it to win contracts for many of the video-on-demand trials in the 1993–95 timeframe, since the system could theoretically accommodate unlimited interactive video streams and other non-video content.

The design was proposed and incorporated into the MPEG-2 international standard. Its object-oriented interface became the mandatory user-to user core interface in DSM-CC, widely used in video stream and file delivery for MPEG-2 compliant systems.

Commercially, DEC&#x27;s Digital and Interactive Information System was used by Adlink to distribute advertising to over two million subscribers.

==== Other ====
* VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VAX/VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
* The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
* The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
* DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
* Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3 player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
* DEC&#x27;s Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
* DEC also produced a proprietary personal computer known as the Rainbow 100. It could run either MS-DOS or CP/M but from a hardware standpoint it was largely incompatible with the IBM PC.

===Networking===
* DEC, Intel and Xerox, through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI &quot;computer interconnect&quot; adapter was the industry&#x27;s first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive &quot;rings&quot;.
* DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations, which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web searches and drug research.
* The X Window System is the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux and available on other operating systems such as MacOS. It was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for the project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
* In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems provided by the engineering department. Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules. A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2. Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
* DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with &quot;dec.com&quot;, registered in 1985, being one of the first of the now ubiquitous &quot;.com&quot; domains. DEC&#x27;s &quot;gatekeeper.dec.com&quot; was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on October 1, 1993. The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
* DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.

===Corporate===
* Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. Many of the sponsors are companies that had acquired pieces of DEC.
* Matrix management

==User organizations==

Originally the users&#x27; group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users&#x27; Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

<doc id="7954" wikidata="Q208211" url="?curid=7954" title="Dead Kennedys">
<text>Dead Kennedys are an American punk rock band that formed in San Francisco, California, in 1978. The band was one of the defining punk bands during its initial eight-year run.

Initially consisting of lead guitarist East Bay Ray, bassist Klaus Flouride, lead vocalist Jello Biafra, drummer Ted and rhythm guitarist 6025, 6025 left in 1979, and Ted left the following year after the band recorded their acclaimed first album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980). The band&#x27;s longest-serving drummer was D. H. Peligro, who replaced Ted in 1981 and remained until his death in 2022. Dead Kennedys recorded the EP &quot;In God We Trust Inc.&quot; (1981), followed by three more studio albums, &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot; (1982), &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; (1985), and &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot; (1986), the latter of which was recorded and released shortly after announcing their breakup in January 1986. Most of the band&#x27;s recordings were released on Alternative Tentacles, an independent record label founded by Biafra and East Bay Ray.

Following Dead Kennedys&#x27; dissolution, Biafra continued to run Alternative Tentacles, and went on to collaborate and record with other artists, including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances. In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties. Although Dead Kennedys have continued to perform over the years, they have not released any more studio albums since &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;.

Dead Kennedys&#x27; lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing political figures and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid-1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury and also hastened the band&#x27;s demise.

== History ==
=== Formation of the band (1978–1979) ===
Dead Kennedys were formed in June 1978 in San Francisco, California, when East Bay Ray (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper &quot;The Recycler&quot;. The original band lineup consisted of East Bay Ray on lead guitar, Klaus Flouride (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, Jello Biafra (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, Ted (Bruce Slesinger) on drums and 6025 (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar. This lineup recorded their first demos. Their first live show was on July 19, 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California. They were the opening act on a bill that included DV8 and Negative Trend with The Offs headlining.

Dead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterward. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under pseudonyms, including &quot;The DK&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Creamsicles&quot; and &quot;The Pink Twinkies&quot;. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen wrote in November 1978, &quot;Just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir, along comes a punk rock group called &#x27;The Dead Kennedys&#x27;, which will play at Mabuhay Gardens on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.&quot; Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay declared, &quot;I can&#x27;t cancel them NOW—there&#x27;s a contract. Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.&quot; However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the Kennedy family, but according to Ray, &quot;the assassinations were in much more poor taste than our band. We actually respect the Kennedy family. . . . When JFK was assassinated, when Martin Luther King was assassinated, when RFK was assassinated, the American Dream was assassinated. . . . Our name is actually homage to the American Dream.&quot;

6025 left the band in March 1979 under somewhat unclear circumstances, generally considered to be musical differences. In June, the band released their first single, &quot;California Über Alles&quot;, on Biafra and East Bay Ray&#x27;s independent label, Alternative Tentacles. The band followed with a poorly attended East Coast tour, being a new and fairly unknown band at the time, without a full album release.

=== &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980–1981) ===

In early 1980, they recorded and released the single &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot;. In June, the band recorded their debut album, &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, released in September of that year on the UK label Cherry Red. The album reached number 33 on the UK Albums Chart. Since its initial release, it has been re-released by several other labels, including IRS, Alternative Tentacles, and Cleopatra. The 2005 reissue—the special 25th-anniversary edition—features the original artwork and a bonus 55-minute DVD documenting the making of the album as well as the band&#x27;s early years.

On March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in an effort to give the event some &quot;new wave credibility&quot;, in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit &quot;California über alles&quot;. The band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra stopped the band—in a manner reminiscent of Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance—and said, &quot;Hold it! We&#x27;ve gotta prove that we&#x27;re adults now. We&#x27;re not a punk rock band, we&#x27;re a new wave band.&quot; The band, all wearing white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song titled &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, a barbed, satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, &quot;Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?&quot;. The song also referenced The Knack&#x27;s song &quot;My Sharona&quot;. &quot;Pull My Strings&quot; was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was one of only two times that the song was ever performed, was released on the band&#x27;s 1987 compilation album &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot;. In a 2017 interview about the show Klaus stated, &quot;We did one other performance of it at The Mabuhay and that was the only other time we performed it... like within a week of the Bammies&quot; It’s unknown if this performance was ever recorded.

In January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was D. H. Peligro (Darren Henley). Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label Polydor Records; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label, though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided not to sign the band after they learned that Dead Kennedys&#x27; next single was to be entitled &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot;.

When &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; came out in May 1981 it caused controversy in the UK, as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30, which would necessitate its title being mentioned on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. It was never played, although it was simply called &quot;&#x27;Too Drunk&#x27; by the Kennedys&quot; by presenter Tony Blackburn.

=== &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot; and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981–1985) ===

After Peligro joined the band, the extended play &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; (1981) saw them move toward a more aggressive hardcore/thrash sound. In addition to the EP&#x27;s controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra&#x27;s most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as &quot;Moral Majority&quot;, &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off!&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Bigger Problem Now&quot; placed Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of social protest, while &quot;Dog Bite&quot;, a cover version of &quot;Rawhide&quot; and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover features a withered starving African child&#x27;s hand being held and dwarfed by a white man&#x27;s hand, a picture that had won the World Press Photo award in 1980, taken in Karamoja district in Uganda by Mike Wells.

The band&#x27;s music had evolved considerably in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulae toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the Alternative Tentacles record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the &quot;DMPO&#x27;s on Broadway&quot; video, originally released by Dirk Dirksen and later reissued on Rhino).

=== &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; and obscenity trial (1985–1986) ===
The release of the album &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; in 1985 showed the band had grown in musical proficiency and lyrical maturity. While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time Klaus Flouride released the similarly experimental solo EP &quot;Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride&quot;. Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as &quot;MTV Get Off The Air&quot; and &quot;Jock-O-Rama (Invasion of the Beef Patrol)&quot; poking fun at mainstream America.

However, the controversy that erupted over H.R. Giger&#x27;s &quot;Penis Landscape&quot;, included as an insert with the album, dwarfed the notoriety of its music. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in Los Angeles County. The girl&#x27;s mother wrote letters of complaint to the California Attorney General and to Los Angeles prosecutors. In June 1986, members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit. The criminal charges focused on an illustration by H.R. Giger, titled &quot;Work 219: Landscape XX&quot; (also known as &quot;Penis Landscape&quot;). Included as a poster with the album, &quot;Penis Landscape&quot; depicts nine copulating penises and vaginas.

Members of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code on a misdemeanor charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics. The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of Mordam Records), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.

In August 1987, the case went to the jury with two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager). However, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury, split 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. District Attorneys Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, Superior Court Judge for the County of Los Angeles. The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide.

After the break up of the band, Jello Biafra brought up the court case on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Biafra was on the show with Tipper Gore as part of a panel discussion on the issues of &quot;controversial music lyrics&quot; and censorship.

=== &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot; and break-up (1986) ===
In addition to the obscenity lawsuit, the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was attracting a more violent audience that imposed an increasing level of brutality on other concertgoers and began to alienate many of the bands and individuals who had helped pioneer the movement in the early 1980s. In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the popularity of increasingly macho hardcore bands, which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for. Biafra penned new songs such as &quot;Chickenshit Conformist&quot; and &quot;Anarchy for Sale&quot; that articulated the band&#x27;s feelings about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of punk rock. During the summer they recorded these for their final album, &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;, which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced Statue of Liberty overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that neither America itself or the punk scene were safe havens any more for &quot;your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free&quot;. The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (&quot;D.M.S.O.&quot;), spoken word (&quot;A Commercial&quot;) and psychedelia (&quot;Cesspools In Eden&quot;).

The band decided to split up in January 1986, prior to the recording and release of &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;, and played their last live show with the original lineup on 21 February. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of spoken-word albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.

=== Reforming of new band line-up and death of Peligro (2001–present) ===
In 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride reformed the Dead Kennedys, with former Dr. Know singer Brandon Cruz replacing Biafra on vocals. The band played under the name &quot;DK Kennedys&quot; for a few concerts, but later reverted to &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by Jeff Penalty. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: &quot;Mutiny on the Bay&quot;, compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and &quot;Live at the Deaf Club&quot;, a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in San Francisco which was greeted with more enthusiasm.

On October 9, 2007, a best of album titled &quot;Milking the Sacred Cow&quot; was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of &quot;Soup Is Good Food&quot; and &quot;Jock-O-Rama&quot;, originally found on &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;.

Jeff Penalty left the band in March 2008 in what he describes as a &quot;not amicable split.&quot; In a statement released, Jeff said that, following a series of disputes, the band had secretly recruited a new singer and played a gig in his neighbourhood, although he also stated he was &quot;really proud of what we were able to accomplish with Dead Kennedys&quot;. He was replaced by former Wynona Riders singer Ron &quot;Skip&quot; Greer. D. H. Peligro also left the band to &quot;take some personal time off&quot;. He was replaced for a tour by Translator drummer Dave Scheff.

On August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in Santa Rosa, California in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.

In August 2010, Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour. The lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking &quot;personal time off&quot; from the band. The tour dates included performances in Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Maine and Hawaii. The band has played a reworked version of their song &quot;MTV Get Off the Air&quot;, re-titled &quot;MP3 Get Off the Web&quot;, with lyrics criticizing music piracy during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in Washington, D.C.

Dead Kennedys had world tours in 2013 and in 2014, the latter mostly in North American cities. In 2015 and 2016 they toured again, including South America, where they had not played since 2001.

In 2017, East Bay Ray revealed that the band and Jello Biafra had been approached by the Punk-oriented music festival Riot Fest about a potential reunion. While Ray and the rest of the band expressed interest in the concept, Biafra refused.

On April 26, 2019, the group released &quot;DK40&quot;, a live compilation album celebrating 40 years since the band formed.

On October 28, 2022, D.H. Peligro died from an overdose of heroin and fentanyl, although it was initially believed to have been from possible head trauma from a fall at his home that day. Since Peligro&#x27;s death, the band has performed in the UK with Santi Guardiola and the United States with Steve Wilson (who had played in D.H.Peligro&#x27;s band Peligro before) filling in on drums.

== Conflicts between members ==
=== Royalties lawsuit ===
In the late 1990s, former band members discovered they were being underpaid in terms of royalties from Alternative Tentacles. East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D. H. Peligro claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay them lower royalty rates and then attempted to disguise the precise nature of the money owed. Biafra claimed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake.

In 1998, the other three members of the band sued Biafra over these allegedly unpaid royalties. A jury ruled in their favor in May 2000, finding Biafra and Alternative Tentacles &quot;guilty of malice, oppression and fraud&quot;. Malice was defined for the jury as &quot;conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others&quot;. Biafra&#x27;s appeal was denied in June 2003; he had to pay the outstanding royalties as well as punitive damages, and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys&#x27; back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership.

This dispute caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that East Bay Ray had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; for use in a Levi&#x27;s jeans commercial, which the band denied. However, an instrumental loop from &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; was part of the 1981 black comedy feature film &quot;Neighbors&quot;, though it was not included on the soundtrack. The band maintains that the Levi&#x27;s story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them.

=== Disputes over new commercial activities ===

Matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to &quot;&quot; in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was dismissive of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed.

Several DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are &quot;cash-ins&quot; on Dead Kennedys&#x27; name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore, he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra&#x27;s accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as &quot;the world&#x27;s greediest karaoke band.&quot; Nevertheless, in 2003, Klaus Flouride said of performances without the band&#x27;s former frontman: &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been a show yet that people didn&#x27;t really like.&quot;

Biafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 1980s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called &quot;Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)&quot;, which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the Melvins, &quot;Sieg Howdy!&quot;

Biafra told an audience at a speaking gig in Trenton, New Jersey, that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; to be used in a rape scene in a Robert Rodriguez movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band Nouvelle Vague, played during a scene in the &quot;Planet Terror&quot; segment of &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in &quot;Planet Terror&quot; has would-be rapist, &quot;Rapist No. 1&quot; (Quentin Tarantino) order one-legged stripper &quot;Cherry Darlin&quot; (Rose McGowan) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague&#x27;s cover of &quot;Too Drunk To Fuck&quot; plays. Biafra, disapproving of the situation, later wrote, &quot;This is their lowest point since Levi&#x27;s... This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades... The terrified woman later &#x27;wins&#x27; by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for... Some people will do anything for money. I can&#x27;t help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H. R. Giger&#x27;s painting on the &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; (sic) poster, saying he couldn&#x27;t bear to show it to his parents. I&#x27;d sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter... The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.&quot;

The reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; remake and the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; video game. East Bay Ray claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game.

The band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an anti-corporate ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003, at a festival in Turkey that was sponsored by Coca-Cola, noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by Coors. However, Biafra claims the previous licensing deals prove otherwise.

== Artistry ==

=== Music and lyrics ===
Dead Kennedys have been described as one of the first hardcore punk bands. They were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America. Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys&#x27; lyrics were often snide. For example, &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; is a multi-layered satire targeting both yuppies and Cambodia&#x27;s recently deposed Khmer Rouge regime. Or, on &quot;Jock-O-Rama&quot;, featured on &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, they mock southern small towns whose residents’ lives revolve around high school football.

=== Logo ===
The original logo was created by Winston Smith. He later contributed artwork for the covers of &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;, &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;, &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot;, the back cover of the &quot;Kill the Poor&quot; single and the Alternative Tentacles logo. When asked about the &quot;DK&quot; logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, &quot;...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.&quot;

=== Influence ===
Dead Kennedys have influenced multiple acts such as System of a Down, Green Day, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Sepultura, Descendents, Bad Religion, Slayer, X, Minutemen, The Hives, Saves the Day and Screeching Weasel among others.

<text>Deoxyribonucleic acid (; DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.

The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or &quot;bases&quot;). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

== Properties ==
DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides. The structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled around the same axis, and have the same pitch of . The pair of chains have a radius of . According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured wide, and one nucleotide unit measured long. The buoyant density of most DNA is 1.7g/cm3.

DNA does not usually exist as a single strand, but instead as a pair of strands that are held tightly together. These two long strands coil around each other, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside, and a base linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A biopolymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar groups. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the 3′-end (three prime end), and 5′-end (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond.

Therefore, any DNA strand normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5′ carbon of a ribose (the 5′ phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3′ carbon of a ribose (the 3′ hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a nucleic acid double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5′ ), and three prime end (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the related pentose sugar ribose in RNA.

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (), cytosine (), guanine () and thymine (). These four bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, forming and base pairs.

=== Nucleobase classification ===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, and , which are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings and . A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.

=== Non-canonical bases ===

Modified bases occur in DNA. The first of these recognized was 5-methylcytosine, which was found in the genome of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; in 1925. The reason for the presence of these noncanonical bases in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses. Modifications of the bases cytosine and adenine, the more common and modified DNA bases, play vital roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression in plants and animals.

A number of noncanonical bases are known to occur in DNA. Most of these are modifications of the canonical bases plus uracil.

** 2,6-Diaminopurine (2-Aminoadenine)

=== Grooves ===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. The major groove is wide, while the minor groove is in width. Due to the larger width of the major groove, the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell &quot;(see below)&quot;, but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in width that would be seen if the DNA was twisted back into the ordinary B form.

=== Base pairing ===


Top, a &#x27; base pair with three hydrogen bonds. Bottom, an &#x27; base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines.

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base pairing. Purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low -content. A Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the 5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in organisms.

==== ssDNA vs. dsDNA ====
Most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for stacks. The two strands can come apart—a process known as melting—to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperatures, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the -content (% basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the melting temperature (also called &quot;Tm&quot; value), which is the temperature at which 50% of the double-strand molecules are converted to single-strand molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high -content have more strongly interacting strands, while short helices with high content have more weakly interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high content, making the strands easier to pull apart.

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the melting temperature &quot;Tm&quot; necessary to break half of the hydrogen bonds. When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.

=== Amount ===

In humans, the total female diploid nuclear genome per cell extends for 6.37 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 208.23 cm long and weighs 6.51 picograms (pg). Male values are 6.27 Gbp, 205.00 cm, 6.41 pg. Each DNA polymer can contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides, such as in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs, and would be long if straightened.

In eukaryotes, in addition to nuclear DNA, there is also mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which encodes certain proteins used by the mitochondria. The mtDNA is usually relatively small in comparison to the nuclear DNA. For example, the human mitochondrial DNA forms closed circular molecules, each of which contains 16,569 DNA base pairs, with each such molecule normally containing a full set of the mitochondrial genes. Each human mitochondrion contains, on average, approximately 5 such mtDNA molecules. Each human cell contains approximately 100 mitochondria, giving a total number of mtDNA molecules per human cell of approximately 500. However, the amount of mitochondria per cell also varies by cell type, and an egg cell can contain 100,000 mitochondria, corresponding to up to 1,500,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome (constituting up to 90% of the DNA of the cell).

=== Sense and antisense ===
A DNA sequence is called a &quot;sense&quot; sequence if it is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the &quot;antisense&quot; sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear. One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.

=== Supercoiling ===
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its &quot;relaxed&quot; state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.

=== Alternative DNA structures ===

DNA exists in many possible conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, and the presence of polyamines in solution.

The first published reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson functions that provided only a limited amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was proposed by Wilkins &quot;et al.&quot; in 1953 for the &quot;in vivo&quot; B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double helix.

Although the &quot;B-DNA form&quot; is most common under the conditions found in cells, it is not a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder.

Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological conditions in partly dehydrated samples of DNA, while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, the opposite of the more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.

=== Alternative DNA chemistry ===

For many years, exobiologists have proposed the existence of a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1 was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.

=== Quadruplex structures ===

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases, known as a guanine tetrad, form a flat plate. These flat four-base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.

=== Branched DNA ===

Branched DNA can form networks containing multiple branches.
In DNA, fraying occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.

=== Artificial bases ===
Several artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named Hachimoji DNA. Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S–B and P–Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence could be seen as an indication that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth. On the other hand, DNA is tightly related to RNA which does not only act as a transcript of DNA but also performs as molecular machines many tasks in cells. For this purpose it has to fold into a structure. It has been shown that to allow to create all possible structures at least four bases are required for the corresponding RNA, while a higher number is also possible but this would be against the natural principle of least effort.

===Acidity===
The phosphate groups of DNA give it similar acidic properties to phosphoric acid and it can be considered as a strong acid. It will be fully ionized at a normal cellular pH, releasing protons which leave behind negative charges on the phosphate groups. These negative charges protect DNA from breakdown by hydrolysis by repelling nucleophiles which could hydrolyze it.

===Macroscopic appearance===
Pure DNA extracted from cells forms white, stringy clumps.

== Chemical modifications and altered DNA packaging ==

=== Base modifications and DNA packaging ===

Structure of cytosine with and without the 5-methyl group. Deamination converts 5-methylcytosine into thymine.
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.

For one example, cytosine methylation produces 5-methylcytosine, which is important for X-inactivation of chromosomes. The average level of methylation varies between organisms—the worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; lacks cytosine methylation, while vertebrates have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine. Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to mutations. Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain, and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the &quot;J-base&quot; in kinetoplastids.

=== Damage ===

A [[covalent]] [[adduct]] between a [[Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1|metabolically activated]] form of [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene]], the major [[mutagen]] in [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]], and DNA

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include oxidizing agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called &quot;intercalation&quot;. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, and in the case of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzo[&quot;a&quot;]pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.

== Biological functions ==

DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In an alternative fashion, a cell may copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

=== Genes and genomes ===

Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation, to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.

In many species, only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding exons, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding repetitive sequences. The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size, or &quot;C-value&quot;, among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the &quot;C-value enigma&quot;. However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression.
Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.

=== Transcription and translation ===

A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter &#x27;words&#x27; called &quot;codons&quot; formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43 combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three &#x27;stop&#x27; or &#x27;nonsense&#x27; codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAG, TAA, and TGA codons, (UAG, UAA, and UGA on the mRNA).

=== Replication ===
Cell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand&#x27;s complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

=== Extracellular nucleic acids ===
Naked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm&#x27;s physical strength and resistance to biological stress.

Cell-free fetal DNA is found in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced to determine a great deal of information about the developing fetus.

Under the name of environmental DNA eDNA has seen increased use in the natural sciences as a survey tool for ecology, monitoring the movements and presence of species in water, air, or on land, and assessing an area&#x27;s biodiversity.

=== Neutrophil extracellular traps ===

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are networks of extracellular fibers, primarily composed of DNA, which allow neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, to kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cells.

== Interactions with proteins ==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

=== DNA-binding proteins ===

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.
In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism&#x27;s genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors&#x27; interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to &quot;read&quot; the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.

Nucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.

Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands. Ligases are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.

==== Topoisomerases and helicases ====
Topoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.

Helicases are proteins that are a type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

==== Polymerases ====
Polymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called &quot;templates&quot;. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which is required for the replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.

== Genetic recombination ==

Structure of the Holliday junction intermediate in genetic recombination. The four separate DNA strands are coloured red, blue, green and yellow.
A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called &quot;chromosome territories&quot;. This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction, when genetic recombination occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell&#x27;s response to double-strand breaks.

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north–south cleavage. The north–south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east–west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

== Evolution ==

DNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.

Building blocks of DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.

Ancient DNA has been recovered from ancient organisms at a timescale where genome evolution can be directly observed, including from extinct organisms up to millions of years old, such as the woolly mammoth.

== Uses in technology ==

=== Genetic engineering ===

Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.

=== DNA profiling ===
Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed DNA profiling, also called &quot;DNA fingerprinting&quot;. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents, bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.

=== DNA enzymes or catalytic DNA ===

Deoxyribozymes, also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, were first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in cells.

=== Bioinformatics ===

Bioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes&#x27; worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.

=== DNA nanotechnology ===
DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the &quot;DNA origami&quot; method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins. DNA and other nucleic acids are the basis of aptamers, synthetic oligonucleotide ligands for specific target molecules used in a range of biotechnology and biomedical applications.

=== History and anthropology ===

Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology.

=== Information storage ===
DNA as a storage device for information has enormous potential since it has much higher storage density compared to electronic devices. However, high costs, slow read and write times (memory latency), and insufficient reliability has prevented its practical use.

== History ==


DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it &quot;nuclein&quot;. In 1878, Albrecht Kossel isolated the non-protein component of &quot;nuclein&quot;, nucleic acid, and later isolated its five primary nucleobases.

In 1909, Phoebus Levene identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of RNA (then named &quot;yeast nucleic acid&quot;). In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in &quot;thymus nucleic acid&quot; (DNA). Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups (&quot;tetranucleotide hypothesis&quot;). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1927, Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a &quot;giant hereditary molecule&quot; made up of &quot;two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template&quot;. In 1928, Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered that traits of the &quot;smooth&quot; form of &quot;Pneumococcus&quot; could be transferred to the &quot;rough&quot; form of the same bacteria by mixing killed &quot;smooth&quot; bacteria with the live &quot;rough&quot; form. This system provided the first clear suggestion that DNA carries genetic information.

In 1933, while studying virgin sea urchin eggs, Jean Brachet suggested that DNA is found in the cell nucleus and that RNA is present exclusively in the cytoplasm. At the time, &quot;yeast nucleic acid&quot; (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while &quot;thymus nucleic acid&quot; (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH.

In 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure.

In 1943, Oswald Avery, along with co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, identified DNA as the transforming principle, supporting Griffith&#x27;s suggestion (Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment). Erwin Chargaff developed and published observations now known as Chargaff&#x27;s rules, stating that in DNA from any species of any organism, the amount of guanine should be equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to thymine. 

Late in 1951, Francis Crick started working with James Watson at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge. DNA&#x27;s role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey–Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the enterobacteria phage T2.

In May 1952, Raymond Gosling, a graduate student working under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin, took an X-ray diffraction image, labeled as &quot;Photo 51&quot;, at high hydration levels of DNA. This photo was given to Watson and Crick by Maurice Wilkins and was critical to their obtaining the correct structure of DNA. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside. Before then, Linus Pauling, and Watson and Crick, had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Franklin&#x27;s identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel. In February 1953, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside. Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double helix of DNA. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons&#x27; lunchtime at The Eagle pub in Cambridge, England to announce that he and Watson had &quot;discovered the secret of life&quot;.
The 25 April 1953 issue of the journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a series of five articles giving the Watson and Crick double-helix structure DNA and evidence supporting it. The structure was reported in a letter titled &quot;&quot;MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid&quot;, in which they said, &quot;It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.&quot; This letter was followed by a letter from Franklin and Gosling, which was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and of their original analysis method. Then followed a letter by Wilkins and two of his colleagues, which contained an analysis of &quot;in vivo&quot; B-DNA X-ray patterns, and which supported the presence &quot;in vivo&quot; of the Watson and Crick structure.

In April 2023, scientists, based on new evidence, concluded that Rosalind Franklin was a contributor and &quot;equal player&quot; in the discovery process of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery.

In 1962, after Franklin&#x27;s death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the central dogma of molecular biology, which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the &quot;adaptor hypothesis&quot;. Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson–Stahl experiment. Further work by Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code. These findings represent the birth of molecular biology.
In 1986, DNA analysis was first used for criminal investigative purposes when police in the UK requested Alec Jeffreys of the University of Leicester to verify or disprove a suspect&#x27;s rape-murder &quot;confession&quot;. In this particular case, the suspect had confessed to two rape-murders, but had later retracted his confession. DNA testing at the university labs soon disproved the veracity of the suspect&#x27;s original &quot;confession&quot;, and the suspect was exonerated from the murder-rape charges.
