<text>Edna St. Vincent Millay (February 22, 1892 – October 19, 1950) was an American lyrical poet and playwright. Millay was a renowned social figure and noted feminist in New York City during the Roaring Twenties and beyond. She wrote much of her prose and hackwork verse under the pseudonym Nancy Boyd.

Millay won the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for her poem &quot;&quot;; she was the first woman and second person to win the award. In 1943, Millay was the sixth person and the second woman to be awarded the Frost Medal for her lifetime contribution to American poetry.

Millay was highly regarded during much of her lifetime, with the prominent literary critic Edmund Wilson calling her &quot;one of the only poets writing in English in our time who have attained to anything like the stature of great literary figures.&quot; By the 1930s, her critical reputation began to decline, as modernist critics dismissed her work for its use of traditional poetic forms and subject matter, in contrast to modernism&#x27;s exhortation to &quot;make it new.&quot; However, the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1960s and 1970s revived an interest in Millay&#x27;s works.

==Early life==
Millay was born Edna Vincent Millay in Rockland, Maine, on February 22, 1892. Her parents were Cora Lounella Buzelle, a custom hair stylist and training nurse for private families, and Henry Tolman Millay, a life insurance agent and teacher who would later become a superintendent of schools. Her middle name derives from St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in New York City, where her uncle&#x27;s life had been saved from an accident at sea just before her birth. Encouraged to read the classics at home, she was too rebellious to make a success of formal education, but she won poetry prizes from an early age.

Edna&#x27;s mother attended a Congregational church. In 1904, Cora officially divorced Millay&#x27;s father for financial irresponsibility and domestic abuse. They had already been separated for some years. Henry and Edna kept a letter correspondence for many years, but he never re-entered the family. Cora and her three daughters – Edna (who called herself &quot;Vincent&quot;), Norma Lounella, and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896) – moved from town to town, living in poverty and surviving various illnesses. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including Shakespeare and Milton, which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora&#x27;s aunt in Camden, Maine, where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame. The family&#x27;s house in Camden was &quot;between the mountains and the sea where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods.&quot;

The three sisters were independent and outspoken, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives. Millay&#x27;s grade school principal, offended by her frank attitude, refused to call her Vincent. Instead, he called her by any woman&#x27;s name that started with a V. At Camden High School, Millay began developing her literary talents, starting at the school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Megunticook&quot;. At 14, she won the &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; Gold Badge for poetry, and by 15, she had published her poetry in the popular children&#x27;s magazine &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, the &quot;Camden Herald&quot;, and the high-profile anthology &quot;Current Literature&quot;.

== Emerging fame and college education ==
Millay&#x27;s fame began in 1912 when, at the age of 20, she entered her poem &quot;Renascence&quot; in a poetry contest in &quot;The Lyric Year&quot;. The backer of the contest, Ferdinand P. Earle, chose Millay as the winner after sorting through thousands of entries, reading only two lines apiece. Earle sent a letter informing Millay of her win before consulting with the other judges, who had previously and separately agreed on a criterion for a winner to winnow down the massive flood of entrants. According to the remaining judges, the winning poem had to exhibit social relevance, and &quot;Renascence&quot; did not. The entry of Orrick Glenday Johns, &quot;Second Avenue,&quot; was about the &quot;squalid scenes&quot; Johns saw on Eldridge Street and lower Second Avenue on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. Millay ultimately placed fourth. The press drew attention to the fact that the Millays were a family of working-class women living in poverty. Because the three winners were men, some people felt that sexism and classism were a factor in Millay&#x27;s poem coming in fourth place.

Controversy in newspaper columns and editorial pages launched the careers of Millay and Johns. Johns, who was receiving hate mail, conceded that he thought her poem was better. &quot;The award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph,&quot; he said. Johns did not attend the awards banquet. The second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money. In the immediate aftermath of the &quot;Lyric Year&quot; controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in Camden, Maine and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay&#x27;s education at Vassar College.

Millay entered Vassar College in 1913 at age 21. Her attendance at Vassar, which she called a &quot;hell-hole&quot;, became a strain to her due to its strict nature. Before she attended college, Millay had a liberal home life that included smoking, drinking, playing gin rummy, and flirting with men. Vassar, on the other hand, expected its students to be refined and live according to their status as young ladies. Millay often would not be formally reprimanded out of respect of her work. At the end of her senior year in 1917, the faculty voted to suspend Millay indefinitely; however, in response to a petition by her peers, she was allowed to graduate. She was a prominent campus writer, becoming a regular contributor to &quot;The Vassar Miscellany&quot;. She had relationships with many fellow students during her time there and kept scrapbooks including drafts of plays written during the period. While at school, she had several romantic relationships with women, including Edith Wynne Matthison, who would go on to become an actress in silent films.

== Move to Greenwich Village ==

After she graduated from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to New York City. She lived in Greenwich Village just as it was becoming known as a bohemian writers&#x27; haven. She resided in a number of places, including a house owned by the Cherry Lane Theatre and 75½ Bedford Street, renowned for being the narrowest in New York City.

While in New York City, Millay was bisexual, developing passing relationships with men and women. The critic Floyd Dell wrote that Millay was &quot;a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a mouth like a valentine.&quot; She maintained relationships with &quot;The Masses &quot;editor Floyd Dell and critic Edmund Wilson, both of whom proposed marriage to her and were refused. Counted among Millay&#x27;s close friends were the writers Witter Bynner, Arthur Davison Ficke, and Susan Glaspell.

In 1919, she wrote the anti-war play &quot;Aria da Capo&quot;, which starred her sister Norma Millay at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City. In 1921, Millay would write &quot;The Lamp and the Bell,&quot; her first verse drama, at the request of the drama department of Vassar. While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the Provincetown Players on Macdougal Street and the Theatre Guild. In 1923, Millay and others founded the Cherry Lane Theatre &quot;to continue the staging of experimental drama.&quot;

During her stay in Greenwich Village, Millay learned to use her poetry for her feminist activism. She often went into detail about topics others found taboo, such as a wife leaving her husband in the middle of the night. Millay&#x27;s 1920 collection &quot;A Few Figs From Thistles&quot; drew controversy for its exploration of female sexuality and feminism. She engaged in highly successful nationwide tours in which she offered public readings of her poetry.

To support her days in the Village, Millay wrote short stories for &quot;Ainslee&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. As an aesthete and a canny protector of her identity as a poet, she insisted on publishing this more mass-appeal work under the pseudonym Nancy Boyd.

== Pulitzer Prize, marriage, and purchase of Steepletop ==
In January 1921, Millay traveled to Paris, where she met and befriended the sculptors Thelma Wood and Constantin Brâncuși, photographer Man Ray, had affairs with journalists George Slocombe and John Carter, and became pregnant by a man named Daubigny. She secured a marriage license but instead returned to New England where her mother Cora helped induce an abortion with alkanet, as recommended in her old copy of Culpeper&#x27;s &quot;Complete Herbal&quot;. Possibly as a result, Millay was frequently ill and weak for much of the next four years.

Millay won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923 for &quot;The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver.&quot; She was the first woman to win the poetry prize, though two women (Sara Teasdale in 1918 and Margaret Widdemer in 1919) won special prizes for their poetry prior to the establishment of the award. In 1924, literary critic Harriet Monroe labeled Millay “the greatest woman poet since Sappho.&quot;

After experiencing his remarkable attention to her during her illness, she married 43-year-old Eugen Jan Boissevain in 1923. Boissevain was the widower of labor lawyer and war correspondent Inez Milholland, a political icon Millay had met during her time at Vassar. A self-proclaimed feminist, Boissevain supported Millay&#x27;s career and took primary care of domestic responsibilities. Both Millay and Boissevain had other lovers throughout their 26-year marriage. For Millay, one such significant relationship was with the poet George Dillon, a student 14 years her junior, whom she met in 1928 at one of her readings at the University of Chicago. Their relationship inspired the sonnets in the collection &quot;Fatal Interview&quot;, which she published in 1931.
In 1925, Boissevain and Millay bought Steepletop near Austerlitz, New York, which had once been a blueberry farm. They built a barn (from a Sears Roebuck kit), and then a writing cabin and a tennis court. Millay grew her own vegetables in a small garden. Later, they bought Ragged Island in Casco Bay, Maine, as a summer retreat. Frequently having trouble with the servants they employed, Millay wrote, &quot;The only people I really hate are servants. They are not really human beings at all.&quot;

Millay was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera House to write a libretto for an opera composed by Deems Taylor. The result, &quot;The King&#x27;s Henchman&quot;, drew on the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; account of Eadgar, King of Wessex. The opera began its production in 1927 to high praise; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera that has reached the stage.&quot;

In August 1927, Millay, along with a number of other writers, was arrested while protesting the impending executions of the Italian American anarchist duo Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Due to her status, she was able to meet with the governor of Massachusetts, Alvan T. Fuller, to plead for a retrial. Her failure to prevent the executions would be a catalyst for her politicization in her later works, beginning with the poem &quot;Justice Denied In Massachusetts&quot; about the case.

== Accident and war effort ==

Millay was staying at the Sanibel Palms Hotel when, on May 2, 1936, a fire started after a kerosene heater on the second floor exploded. Everything was destroyed, including the only copy of Millay&#x27;s long verse poem, &quot;Conversation at Midnight&quot;, and a 1600s poetry collection written by the Roman poet Catullus of the first century BC. She would go on to rewrite &quot;Conversation at Midnight&quot; from memory and release it the following year.

In the summer of 1936, Millay was riding in a station wagon when the door suddenly swung open, and Millay “was hurled out into the pitch-darkness...and rolled for some distance down a rocky gully.&quot; The accident severely damaged nerves in her spine, requiring frequent surgeries and hospitalizations, and at least daily doses of morphine. Millay lived the rest of her life in &quot;constant pain&quot;.

Despite her accident, Millay was sufficiently alarmed by the rise of fascism to write against it. During World War I, she had been a dedicated and active pacifist; however, in 1940, she advocated for the U.S. to enter the war against the Axis and became an ardent supporter of the war effort. She later worked with the Writers&#x27; War Board to create propaganda, including poetry. Millay&#x27;s reputation in poetry circles was damaged by her war work. Merle Rubin noted, &quot;She seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than Ezra Pound did for championing fascism.&quot;

In 1942 in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Millay mourned the destruction of the Czech village Lidice. Nazi forces had razed Lidice, slaughtered its male inhabitants and scattered its surviving residents in retaliation for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. Millay wrote: &quot;The whole world holds in its arms today / The murdered village of Lidice, / Like the murdered body of a little child.&quot; This article would serve as the basis of her 32-page work &quot;Murder of Lidice,&quot; published by Harper and Brothers in 1942. The poem loosely served as the basis of the 1943 MGM movie &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot;.

Millay was critical of capitalism and sympathetic to socialist ideals, which she labeled as &quot;of a free and equal society&quot;, but she did not identify as a communist. She told Grace Hamilton King in 1941 that she had been &quot;almost a fellow-traveller with the communist idea as far as it went along with the socialist idea.&quot;

Despite the excellent sales of her books in the 1930s, her declining reputation, constant medical bills, and frequent demands from her mentally ill sister Kathleen meant that for most of her last years, Millay was in debt to her own publisher. Author Daniel Mark Epstein also concludes from her correspondence that Millay developed a passion for thoroughbred horse-racing, and spent much of her income investing in a racing stable of which she had quietly become an owner.

== Post-war and death ==
Although her work and reputation declined during the war years, possibly due to a morphine addiction she acquired following her accident, she subsequently sought treatment for it and was successfully rehabilitated. Boissevain died in 1949 of lung cancer, leaving Millay to live alone for the last year of her life. Her final collection of poems was published posthumously as the volume &quot;Mine the Harvest.&quot; The title sonnet recalls her career:

&lt;poem&gt;Those hours when happy hours were my estate, —
Entailed, as proper, for the next in line,
Yet mine the harvest, and the title mine —
Those acres, fertile, and the furrows straight,
From which the lark would rise — all of my late
Enchantments, still, in brilliant colours, shine,&lt;/poem&gt;
Millay died at her home on October 19, 1950, at age 58. She had fallen down the stairs and was found with a broken neck approximately eight hours after her death. Her physician reported that she had suffered a heart attack following a coronary occlusion. She is buried alongside her husband at Steepletop, Austerlitz, New York.

== Legacy ==
After her death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described her as &quot;an idol of the younger generation during the glorious early days of Greenwich Village&quot; and as &quot;one of the greatest American poets of her time.&quot; Thomas Hardy said that America had two great attractions: the skyscraper and the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay. The poet Richard Wilbur asserted that Millay &quot;wrote some of the best sonnets of the century.&quot;

Nancy Milford published a biography of the poet in 2001, &quot;Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay.&quot; Millay&#x27;s sister, Norma Millay (then her only living relative), offered Milford access to the poet&#x27;s papers based on her successful biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s wife, &quot;Zelda&quot;. Milford also edited and wrote an introduction for a collection of Millay&#x27;s poems called &quot;The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.&quot; Milford would label Millay as &quot;the herald of the New Woman.&quot;

A &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Milford noted that &quot;readers of poetry probably dismiss Millay as mediocre,&quot; and noted that within 20 years of Millay&#x27;s death, &quot;the public was impatient with what had come to seem a poised, genteel emotionalism.&quot; However, it concludes that &quot;readers should come away from Milford&#x27;s book with their understanding of Millay deepened and charged.&quot; The New York Review of Books called Milford&#x27;s biography &quot;the story of the life that eclipsed the work,&quot; and dismissed much of Millay&#x27;s work as &quot;soggy&quot; and &quot;doggerel.&quot;

Millay was named by Equality Forum as one of their &quot;31 Icons&quot; of the 2015 LGBT History Month.

=== Properties, conservation, and memorials ===
Millay&#x27;s sister Norma and her husband, the painter and actor Charles Frederick Ellis, moved to Steepletop after Millay&#x27;s death. In 1973, they established the Millay Colony for the Arts on seven acres near the house and barn. After the death of her husband in 1976, Norma continued to run the program until her death in 1986. At 17, the poet Mary Oliver visited Steepletop and became a close friend of Norma. She would later live at Steepletop off-and-on for seven years and helped to organize Millay&#x27;s papers. Mary Oliver herself went on to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, greatly inspired by Millay&#x27;s work. In 2006, the state of New York paid $1.69 million to acquire of Steepletop, to add the land to a nearby state forest preserve. The proceeds of the sale were used by the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society to restore the farmhouse and grounds and turn it into a museum. The museum opened to the public in the summer of 2010. Conservation of the house has been ongoing.

Conservation of Millay&#x27;s birthplace began in 2015 with the purchase of the double-house at 198–200 Broadway, Rockland, Maine. Built in 1891, Henry T. and Cora B. Millay were the first tenants of the north side, where Cora gave birth to her first of three daughters during a February 1892 squall. Identified as the Singhi Double House, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 not as the poet&#x27;s birthplace, but as a &quot;good example&quot; of the &quot;modest double houses&quot; that made up almost 10% of residences in the largely working-class city between 1837 and the early 1900s. When fully restored by 2023, half the house will be dedicated to honoring Millay&#x27;s legacy with workshops and classes, while the other half will be rented for income to sustain conservation and programs. A writer-in-residence will be funded by the Ellis Beauregard Foundation and the Millay House Rockland.Millay is also memorialized in Camden, Maine, where she lived beginning in 1900. A statue of the poet stands in Harbor Park, which shares with Mt. Battie the view of Penobscot Bay that opens &quot;Renascence&quot;, the poem that launched Millay&#x27;s career. Camden Public Library also shares Mt. Battie&#x27;s view. It has the first couplets of &quot;Renascence&quot; inscribed along the perimeter of a large skylight: &quot;All I could see from where I stood / Was three long mountains and a wood; / I turned and looked another way, / And saw three islands in a bay.&quot; The library&#x27;s Walsh History Center collection contains the scrapbooks created by Millay&#x27;s high-school friend, Corinne Sawyer, as well as photos, letters, newspaper clippings, and other ephemera.

=== In popular culture ===

<doc id="9827" wikidata="Q189049" url="?curid=9827" title="Ethnocentrism">
<text>Ethnocentrism in social science and anthropology—as well as in colloquial English discourse—means to apply one&#x27;s own culture or ethnicity as a frame of reference to judge other cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and people, instead of using the standards of the particular culture involved. Since this judgment is often negative, some people also use the term to refer to the belief that one&#x27;s culture is superior to, or more correct or normal than, all others—especially regarding the distinctions that define each ethnicity&#x27;s cultural identity, such as language, behavior, customs, and religion. In common usage, it can also simply mean any culturally biased judgment. For example, ethnocentrism can be seen in the common portrayals of the Global South and the Global North.

Ethnocentrism is sometimes related to racism, stereotyping, discrimination, or xenophobia. However, the term &quot;ethnocentrism&quot; does not necessarily involve a negative view of the others&#x27; race or indicate a negative connotation. The opposite of ethnocentrism is cultural relativism, a guiding philosophy stating that the best way to understand a different culture is through their perspective rather than judging them from the subjective viewpoints shaped by one&#x27;s own cultural standards.

The term &quot;ethnocentrism&quot; was first applied in the social sciences by American sociologist William G. Sumner. In his 1906 book, &quot;Folkways,&quot; Sumner describes ethnocentrism as &quot;the technical name for the view of things in which one&#x27;s own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.&quot; He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, the belief in one&#x27;s own group&#x27;s superiority, and contempt for outsiders.

Over time, ethnocentrism developed alongside the progression of social understandings by people such as social theorist Theodore W. Adorno. In Adorno&#x27;s &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot;, he and his colleagues of the Frankfurt School established a broader definition of the term as a result of &quot;in group-out group differentiation&quot;, stating that ethnocentrism &quot;combines a positive attitude toward one&#x27;s own ethnic/cultural group (the in-group) with a negative attitude toward the other ethnic/cultural group (the out-group).&quot; Both of these juxtaposing attitudes are also a result of a process known as &quot;social identification&quot; and &quot;social counter-identification.&quot;


==Origins and development==
The term ethnocentrism derives from two Greek words: &quot;ethnos&quot;, meaning nation, and &quot;kentron&quot;, meaning center. Scholars believe this term was coined by Polish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz in the 19th century, although alternate theories suggest that he only popularized the concept as opposed to inventing it. He saw ethnocentrism as a phenomenon similar to the delusions of geocentrism and anthropocentrism, defining Ethnocentrism as &quot;the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point, not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations, but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past.&quot;

Subsequently, in the 20th century, American social scientist William G. Sumner proposed two different definitions in his 1906 book &quot;Folkways.&quot; Sumner stated that &quot;Ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one&#x27;s own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.&quot; In the &quot;War and Other Essays (1911)&quot;, he wrote that &quot;the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism.&quot; According to Boris Bizumic, it is a popular misunderstanding that Sumner originated the term ethnocentrism, stating that in actuality, he brought ethnocentrism into the mainstreams of anthropology, social science, and psychology through his English publications.

Several theories have been reinforced through the social and psychological understandings of ethnocentrism including T.W Adorno&#x27;s Authoritarian Personality Theory (1950), Donald T. Campbell&#x27;s Realistic Group Conflict Theory (1972), and Henri Tajfel&#x27;s Social identity theory (1986). These theories have helped to distinguish ethnocentrism as a means to better understand the behaviors caused by in-group and out-group differentiation throughout history and society.

== Ethnocentrism in social sciences ==

In social sciences, ethnocentrism means to judge another culture based on the standard of one&#x27;s own culture instead of the standard of the other particular culture. When people use their own culture as a parameter to measure other cultures, they often tend to think that their culture is superior and see other cultures as inferior and bizarre. Ethnocentrism can be explained at different levels of analysis. For example, at an intergroup level, this term is seen as a consequence of a conflict between groups; while at the individual level, in-group cohesion and out-group hostility can explain personality traits. Also, ethnocentrism can help us to explain the construction of identity. Ethnocentrism can explain the basis of one&#x27;s identity by excluding the outgroup that is the target of ethnocentric sentiments and used as a way of distinguishing oneself from other groups that can be more or less tolerant. This practice in social interactions creates social boundaries, such boundaries define and draw symbolic boundaries of the group that one wants to be associated with or belong to. In this way, ethnocentrism is a term not only limited to anthropology but also can be applied to other fields of social sciences like sociology or psychology. Ethnocentrism may be particularly enhanced in the presence of interethnic competition, hostility and violence. On the other hand, ethnocentrism may negatively influence expatriate worker&#x27;s performance.

A more recent interpretation of ethnocentrism, which expands upon the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, highlights its positive dimension. Political sociologist Audrey Alejandro of the London School of Economics argues that, while ethnocentrism does produce social hierarchies, it also produces diversity by maintaining the different dispositions, practices, and knowledge of identity groups. Diversity is both fostered and undermined by ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism, for Alejandro, is therefore neither something to be suppressed nor celebrated uncritically. Rather, observers can cultivate a &#x27;balanced ethnocentrism&#x27;, (individual self worth) allowing themselves to be challenged and transformed by difference whilst still protecting difference.

== Anthropology ==
The classifications of ethnocentrism originate from the studies of anthropology. With its omnipresence throughout history, ethnocentrism has always been a factor in how different cultures and groups related to one another. Examples including how historically, foreigners would be characterized as &quot;Barbarians&quot;. These trends exist in complex societies, e.g., &quot;the Jews consider themselves to be the &#x27;chosen people&#x27;, and the Greeks defend all foreigners as &#x27;barbarians&#x27;&quot;, and how China believed their country to be &quot;the centre of the world&quot;. However, the anthropocentric interpretations initially took place most notably in the 19th century when anthropologists began to describe and rank various cultures according to the degree to which they had developed significant milestones, such as monotheistic religions, technological advancements, and other historical progressions.

Most rankings were strongly influenced by colonization and the belief to improve societies they colonized, ranking the cultures based on the progression of their western societies and what they classified as milestones. Comparisons were mostly based on what the colonists believed as superior and what their western societies have accomplished. Victorian era politician and historian Thomas Macaulay once claimed that &quot;one shelf of a Western library&quot; had more knowledge than the centuries of text and literature written by Asian cultures. Ideas developed by Western scientists such as Herbert Spencer, including the concept of the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, contained ethnocentric ideals; influencing the belief that societies which were &#x27;superior&#x27; were most likely to survive and prosper. Edward Said&#x27;s concept of Orientalism represented how Western reactions to non-Western societies were based on an &quot;unequal power relationship&quot; that the Western world developed due to its history of colonialism and the influence it held over non-Western societies.

The ethnocentric classification of &quot;primitive&quot; were also used by 19th and 20th century anthropologists and represented how unawareness in cultural and religious understanding changed overall reactions to non-Western societies. 19th-century anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor wrote about &quot;primitive&quot; societies in &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; (1871), creating a &quot;civilization&quot; scale where it was implied that ethnic cultures preceded civilized societies. The use of &quot;savage&quot; as a classification is modernly known as &quot;tribal&quot; or &quot;pre-literate&quot; where it was usually referred as a derogatory term as the &quot;civilization&quot; scale became more common. Examples that demonstrate a lack of understanding include when European travelers judged different languages based on the fact that they could not understand it and displayed a negative reaction, or the intolerance displayed by Westerners when exposed to unknown religions and symbolisms. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German philosopher, justified Western imperialism by reasoning that since the non-Western societies were &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;uncivilized&quot;, their culture and history was not worth conserving and thus should welcome Westernization.

Anthropologist Franz Boas saw the flaws in this formulaic approach to ranking and interpreting cultural development and committed himself to overthrowing this inaccurate reasoning due to many factors involving their individual characteristics. With his methodological innovations, Boas sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. In his 1911 book &quot;The Mind of Primitive Man&quot;, Boas wrote that:It is somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has been controlling all our actions from the time of our birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, which are of no less value than ours, although it may be impossible for us to appreciate their values without having grown up under their influence.Together, Boas and his colleagues propagated the certainty that there are no inferior races or cultures. This egalitarian approach introduced the concept of cultural relativism to anthropology, a methodological principle for investigating and comparing societies in as unprejudiced a way as possible and without using a developmental scale as anthropologists at the time were implementing. Boas and anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski argued that any human science had to transcend the ethnocentric views that could blind any scientist&#x27;s ultimate conclusions.

Both had also urged anthropologists to conduct ethnographic fieldwork to overcome their ethnocentrism. To help, Malinowski would develop the theory of functionalism as guides for producing non-ethnocentric studies of different cultures. Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include Margaret Mead&#x27;s &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (1928), which in time has met with severe criticism for its incorrect data and generalisations, Malinowski&#x27;s &quot;The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia&quot; (1929), and Ruth Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot; (1934). Mead and Benedict were two of Boas&#x27;s students.

Scholars generally agree that Boas developed his ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests. Following Kant, Boas pointed out the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs, would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values.

==Causes==
Ethnocentrism is believed to be a learned behavior embedded into a variety of beliefs and values of an individual or group.

Due to enculturation, individuals in in-groups have a deeper sense of loyalty and are more likely to follow the norms and develop relationships with associated members. Within relation to enculturation, ethnocentrism is said to be a transgenerational problem since stereotypes and similar perspectives can be enforced and encouraged as time progresses. Although loyalty can increase better in-grouper approval, limited interactions with other cultures can prevent individuals to have an understanding and appreciation towards cultural differences resulting in greater ethnocentrism.

The social identity approach suggests that ethnocentric beliefs are caused by a strong identification with one&#x27;s own culture that directly creates a positive view of that culture. It is theorized by Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner that to maintain that positive view, people make social comparisons that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.

Alternative or opposite perspectives could cause individuals to develop naïve realism and be subject to limitations in understandings. These characteristics can also lead to individuals to become subject to ethnocentrism, when referencing out-groups, and black sheep effect, where personal perspectives contradict those from fellow in-groupers.

Realistic conflict theory assumes that ethnocentrism happens due to &quot;real or perceived conflict&quot; between groups. This also happens when a dominant group may perceive the new members as a threat. Scholars have recently demonstrated that individuals are more likely to develop in-group identification and out-group negatively in response to intergroup competition, conflict, or threat.

Although the causes of ethnocentric beliefs and actions can have varying roots of context and reason, the effects of ethnocentrism has had both negative and positive effects throughout history. The most detrimental effects of ethnocentrism resulting into genocide, apartheid, slavery, and many violent conflicts. Historical examples of these negative effects of ethnocentrism are The Holocaust, the Crusades, the Trail of Tears, and the internment of Japanese Americans. These events were a result of cultural differences reinforced inhumanely by a majority group who thought of themselves as superior. In his 1976 book on evolution, &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins writes that &quot;blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretative in terms of Hamilton&#x27;s genetic theory.&quot; Simulation-based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.

The positive examples of ethnocentrism throughout history have aimed to prohibit the callousness of ethnocentrism and reverse the perspectives of living in a single culture. These organizations can include the formation of the United Nations; aimed to maintain international relations, and the Olympic Games; a celebration of sports and friendly competition between cultures.

== Effects ==
A study in New Zealand was used to compare how individuals associate with in-groups and out-groupers and has a connotation to discrimination. Strong in-group favoritism benefits the dominant groups and is different from out-group hostility and/or punishment. A suggested solution is to limit the perceived threat from the out-group that also decreases the likeliness for those supporting the in-groups to negatively react.

Ethnocentrism also influences consumer preference over which goods they purchase. A study that used several in-group and out-group orientations have shown a correlation between national identity, consumer cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and the methods consumers choose their products, whether imported or domestic. Countries with high levels of nationalism and isolationism are more likely to demonstrate consumer ethnocentrism, and have a significant preference for domestically-produced goods.

== Ethnocentrism and racism ==
Ethnocentrism is usually associated with racism. However, as mentioned before, ethnocentrism does not necessarily implicate a negative connotation. In European research, the term racism is not linked to ethnocentrism because Europeans avoid applying the concept of race to humans; meanwhile, using this term is not a problem for American researchers. Since ethnocentrism implicated a strong identification with one&#x27;s in-group, it mostly automatically leads to negative feelings and stereotyping to the members of the outgroup, which can be confused with racism. Finally, scholars agree that avoiding stereotypes is an indispensable prerequisite to overcome ethnocentrism; and mass media play a key role regarding this issue. The differences that each culture possess causes could hinder one another leading to ethnocentrism and racism. A Canadian study established the differences among French Canadian and English Canadian respondents based on products that would be purchased due to ethnocentrism and racism. Due to how diverse the world has become, society has begun to misinterpret the term cultural diversity, by using ethnocentrism to create controversy among all cultures.

== Effects of ethnocentrism in the media ==

=== Film ===
As the United States leads the film industry in worldwide revenue, ethnocentric views can be transmitted through character tropes and underlying themes. The 2003 film &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; was analyzed to have strong ethnocentric themes, such as in-group preference and the tendency to show judgement towards those in the out-group. Similarly, the film received criticism for historical inaccuracies and perpetuating a &quot;white savior narrative,&quot; showing a tendency for ethnocentrism centered around the United States.

=== Social media ===
Approximately 67.1% of the global population use the internet regularly, with 63.7% of the population being social media users. In a 2023 study, researchers found that social media can enable its users to become more tolerant of other people, bridging the gap between cultures, and contributing to global knowledge. In a similar study done regarding social media use by Kenyan teens, researchers found that when social media is limited to a certain group, it can increase ethnocentric views and ideologies.

<text>In computer engineering, an execution unit (E-unit or EU) is a part of a processing unit that performs the operations and calculations forwarded from the instruction unit. It may have its own internal control sequence unit (not to be confused with a CPU&#x27;s main control unit), some registers, and other internal units such as an arithmetic logic unit, address generation unit, floating-point unit, load–store unit, branch execution unit or other smaller and more specific components, and can be tailored to support a certain datatype, such as integers or floating-points.

It is common for modern processing units to have multiple parallel functional units within its execution units, which is referred to as superscalar design. The simplest arrangement is to use a single bus manager unit to manage the memory interface and the others to perform calculations. Additionally, modern execution units are usually pipelined.

<text>Eskilstuna Municipality () is a municipality in Södermanland County in southeast Sweden, between Lake Mälaren and Lake Hjälmaren. The seat of the municipality is in the city of Eskilstuna.

The present municipality was formed in 1971 by the merger of the City of Eskilstuna, the City of Torshälla and five rural municipalities. It is the largest municipality in the Sörmland region in terms of population, having more than 1/3 of the overall county population.

==Geography==
Eskilstuna Municipality is an inland municipality, although the low-lying Mälaren renders the lengthy lakeshore to be at above sea level. The highest point is at &quot;Tyckenhed&quot; in the southwest of the municipality at above sea level.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Eskilstuna Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 78,420 Swedish citizens of voting age resident in the municipality. 47.5% voted for the left coalition and 51.0% for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the Riksdag elections of Eskilstuna Municipality since the 1972 municipality reform. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not published by SCB between 1988 and 1998 at a municipal level to the party&#x27;s small nationwide size at the time. &quot;Votes&quot; denotes valid votes, whereas &quot;Turnout&quot; denotes also blank and invalid votes.

Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985, and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but is still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

==Twin towns - Sister cities==

Eskilstuna is twinned with:

* Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States

<text>The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR; formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international convention to protect human rights and political freedoms in Europe. Drafted in 1950 by the newly formed Council of Europe, the convention entered into force on 3 September 1953. All Council of Europe member states are party to the convention and new members are expected to ratify the convention at the earliest opportunity.

The convention established the European Court of Human Rights (generally referred to by the initials ECtHR). Any person who feels their rights have been violated under the convention by a state party can take a case to the court. Judgments finding violations are binding on the states concerned and they are obliged to execute them. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe monitors the execution of judgments, particularly to ensure payments awarded by the court appropriately compensate applicants for the damage they have sustained.

The convention has sixteen protocols, which amend the convention framework.

The convention has had a significant influence on the law in Council of Europe member countries and is widely considered the most effective international treaty for human rights protection.

==History==
The European Convention on Human Rights has played an important role in the development and awareness of human rights in Europe. The development of a regional system of human rights protections operating across Europe can be seen as a direct response to twin concerns. First, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, can be seen as part of a wider response from the Allied powers in delivering a human rights agenda to prevent the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War from happening again.

Second, the convention was a response to the growth of Stalinism in Central and Eastern Europe and was designed to protect the member states of the Council of Europe from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot; throughout the convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself. Consequently, the convention was principally conceived, at the time of its creation, as an &quot;anti-totalitarian&quot; measure to help stabilise social democracies in Western Europe, rather than as a specific reaction to the legacy of Nazism and the Holocaust. This approach was a continuation of Atlanticist beliefs from World War II and the early Cold War which called for the defence of democracy against all forms of authoritarianism.

From 7 to 10 May 1948, politicians including Winston Churchill, François Mitterrand, and Konrad Adenauer, as well as civil society representatives, academics, business leaders, trade unionists, and religious leaders convened the Congress of Europe in The Hague. At the end of the Congress, a declaration and following pledge to create the convention was issued. The second and third articles of the pledge state: &quot;We desire a Charter of Human Rights guaranteeing liberty of thought, assembly and expression as well as right to form a political opposition. We desire a Court of Justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of this Charter.&quot;

The convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after the Second World War and Hague Congress. Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first-ever meeting of the council&#x27;s Consultative Assembly to draft a &quot;charter of human rights&quot; and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the chair of the Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the convention, based on an earlier draft produced by the European Movement. As a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, he had seen first-hand of a binding international court.

French former minister and French Resistance fighter Pierre-Henri Teitgen submitted a report to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that had recently been agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate. After extensive debates, the Assembly sent its final proposal to the council&#x27;s Committee of Ministers, which convened a group of experts to draft the convention itself.

The convention was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing &quot;effective political democracy&quot;, from the strongest traditions in the United Kingdom, France and other member states of the fledgling Council of Europe, as said by Guido Raimondi, President of the European Court of Human Rights:

The convention was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 in Rome. It was ratified and entered into force on 3 September 1953. It is overseen and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and the Council of Europe. Until procedural reforms in the late 1990s, the convention was also overseen by a European Commission on Human Rights.

Proposals for reform of the convention have been put forward, for example by former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and other UK politicians. Conservative politicians have proposed reform or withdrawal from the convention during the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election.

==Drafting==
The convention is drafted in broad terms, in a similar (albeit more modern) manner to the 1689 Scottish Claim of Right Act 1689, to the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1791 U.S. Bill of Rights, the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, or the first part of the German Basic Law. Statements of principle are, from a juridical point of view, not determinative and require and have given occasion to extensive interpretation by courts to bring out meaning in particular factual situations.

==Convention articles==
As amended by Protocol 11, the convention consists of three parts. The main rights and freedoms are contained in Section I, which consists of Articles 2 to 18. Section II (Articles 19 to 51) sets up the court and its rules of operation. Section III contains various concluding provisions.

Before the entry into force of Protocol 11, Section II (Article 19) set up the commission and the court, Sections III (Articles 20 to 37) and IV (Articles 38 to 59) included the high-level machinery for the operation of, respectively, the commission and the court, and Section V contained various concluding provisions.

Many of the articles in Section I are structured in two paragraphs: the first sets out a basic right or freedom (such as Article 2(1) – the right to life) but the second contains various exclusions, exceptions or limitations on the basic right (such as Article 2(2) – which excepts certain uses of force leading to death).

===Article 1 – respecting rights===
Article 1 simply binds the signatory parties to secure the rights under the other articles of the convention &quot;within their jurisdiction&quot;. In exceptional cases, &quot;jurisdiction&quot; may not be confined to a contracting state&#x27;s own national territory; the obligation to secure convention rights then also extends to foreign territories, such as occupied land in which the state exercises effective control.

In &quot;Loizidou v Turkey&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that jurisdiction of member states to the convention extended to areas under that state&#x27;s effective control as a result of military action.

===Article 2 – life===

Article 2 protects the right of every person to their life. The right to life extends only to human beings, not to animals, nor to &quot;legal persons&quot; such as corporations. In &quot;Evans v United Kingdom&quot;, the court ruled that the question of whether the right to life extends to a human embryo fell within a state&#x27;s margin of appreciation. In &quot;Vo v France&quot;, the court declined to extend the right to life to an unborn child, while stating that &quot;it is neither desirable, nor even possible as matters stand, to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention&quot;.

The court has ruled that states have three main duties under Article 2:

# a duty to refrain from unlawful killing,
# a duty to investigate suspicious deaths, and
# in certain circumstances, a positive duty to prevent foreseeable loss of life.

The first paragraph of the article contains an exception for lawful executions, although this exception has largely been superseded by Protocols 6 and 13. Protocol 6 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in peacetime, while Protocol 13 extends the prohibition to all circumstances. (For more on Protocols 6 and 13, see below).

The second paragraph of Article 2 provides that death resulting from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is &quot;no more than absolutely necessary&quot;.

Signatory states to the convention can only derogate from the rights contained in Article 2 for deaths which result from lawful acts of war.

The European Court of Human Rights did not rule upon the right to life until 1995, when in &quot;McCann and Others v United Kingdom&quot; it ruled that the exception contained in the second paragraph does not constitute situations when it is permitted to kill, but situations where it is permitted to use force which might result in the deprivation of life.

===Article 3 – torture===
Article 3 prohibits torture and &quot;inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;. There are no exceptions or limitations on this right. This provision usually applies, apart from torture, to cases of severe police violence and poor conditions in detention.

The court has emphasised the fundamental nature of Article 3 in holding that the prohibition is made in &quot;absolute terms ... irrespective of the victim&#x27;s conduct&quot;. The court has also held that states cannot deport or extradite individuals who might be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the recipient state.

The first case to examine Article 3 was the Greek case, which set an influential precedent. In &quot;Ireland v. United Kingdom&quot; (1979–1980) the court ruled that the five techniques developed by the United Kingdom (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink), as used against fourteen detainees in Northern Ireland by the United Kingdom were &quot;inhuman and degrading&quot; and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to &quot;torture&quot;.

In &quot;Aksoy v. Turkey&quot; (1997) the court found Turkey guilty of torture in 1996 in the case of a detainee who was suspended by his arms while his hands were tied behind his back.

&quot;Selmouni v. France&quot; (2000) the court has appeared to be more open to finding states guilty of torture ruling that since the convention is a &quot;living instrument&quot;, treatment which it had previously characterized as inhuman or degrading treatment might in future be regarded as torture.

In 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use the five techniques in Northern Ireland in 1971–1972 had been taken by British ministers, the Irish Government asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement. In 2018, by six votes to one, the court declined.

===Article 4 – servitude===
Article 4 prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour but exempts labour:
* done as a normal part of imprisonment,
* in the form of compulsory military service or work done as an alternative by conscientious objectors,
* required to be done during a state of emergency, and
* considered to be a part of a person&#x27;s normal &quot;civic obligations&quot;.

===Article 5 – liberty and security===
Article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. Liberty and security of the person are taken as a &quot;compound&quot; concept – security of the person has not been subject to separate interpretation by the court.

Article 5 provides the right to liberty, subject only to lawful arrest or detention under certain other circumstances, such as arrest on reasonable suspicion of a crime or imprisonment in fulfilment of a sentence. The article also provides those arrested with the right to be informed, in a language they understand, of the reasons for the arrest and any charge they face, the right of prompt access to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of the arrest or detention, to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.
* &quot;Assanidze v. Georgia&quot;, App. No. 71503/01 (Eur. Ct. H.R. 8 April 2004)

===Article 6 – fair trial===
Article 6 provides a detailed right to a fair trial, including the right to a public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the presumption of innocence, and other minimum rights for those charged with a criminal offence (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter).

The majority of convention violations that the court finds today are excessive delays, in violation of the &quot;reasonable time&quot; requirement, in civil and criminal proceedings before national courts, mostly in Italy and France. Under the &quot;independent tribunal&quot; requirement, the court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. In compliance with this Article, Turkey has now adopted a law abolishing these courts.

Another significant set of violations concerns the &quot;confrontation clause&quot; of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined). In this respect, problems of compliance with Article 6 may arise when national laws allow the use in evidence of the testimonies of absent, anonymous and vulnerable witnesses.
* &quot;Steel v. United Kingdom&quot; (1998) 28 EHRR 603
* &quot;Assanidze v. Georgia&quot; [2004] ECHR 140
* &quot;Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom&quot; (2012) – Abu Qatada could not be deported to Jordan as that would be a violation of Article 6 &quot;given the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture&quot;. This was the first time the court ruled that such an expulsion would be a violation of Article 6.

===Article 7 – retroactivity===
Article 7 prohibits the retroactive criminalisation of acts and omissions. No person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by international law. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.

Article 7 incorporates the legal principle &quot;nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege&quot; (no crime, no penalty without law) into the convention.

Relevant cases are:
* &quot;Kokkinakis v. Greece&quot; [1993] ECHR 20
* &quot;S.A.S. v. France&quot; [2014] ECHR 69

===Article 8 – privacy===
Article 8 provides a right to respect for one&#x27;s &quot;private and family life, his home and his correspondence&quot;, subject to restrictions that are &quot;in accordance with law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&quot;. This article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the court has given the protection for &quot;private and family life&quot; that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still allows such familial sexual acts to be criminal.

This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a state from interfering with rights, and thus &quot;not&quot; to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the state to become active, and to &quot;do&quot; something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).

Notable cases:
* &quot;Zakharov v. Russia&quot; [2015] EHCR 47143/06
* &quot;Malone v. United Kingdom&quot; [1984] ECHR 10, (1984) 7 EHRR 14
* &quot;Oliari and Others v. Italy&quot; (2015)
* &quot;Vavřička and Others v. the Czech Republic&quot; (ECtHR April 8, 2021), holding that the nation of the Czech Republic did not violate the convention by imposing a vaccination mandate on children in that country

===Article 9 – conscience and religion===
Article 9 provides a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This includes the freedom to change a religion or belief, and to manifest a religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance, subject to certain restrictions that are &quot;in accordance with law&quot; and &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot;.

Relevant cases are:
* &quot;Kokkinakis v. Greece&quot; [1993] ECHR 20

* &quot;Eweida v. United Kingdom&quot; [2013] ECHR 2013

===Article 10 – expression===
Article 10 provides the right to freedom of expression, subject to certain restrictions that are &quot;in accordance with law&quot; and &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot;. This right includes the freedom to hold opinions, and to receive and impart information and ideas, but allows restrictions for:
* interests of national security
* territorial integrity or public safety
* prevention of disorder or crime
* protection of health or morals
* protection of the reputation or the rights of others
* preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence
* maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary

Relevant cases are:
* &quot;Lingens v. Austria&quot; (1986) 8 EHRR 407
* &quot;The Observer and The Guardian v. United Kingdom&quot; (1991) 14 EHRR 153, the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case.

* &quot;Appleby v. United Kingdom&quot; (2003) 37 EHRR 38, protests in a private shopping centre
* &quot;TV Vest and Rogaland Pensioners Party v. Norway&quot; (2008)

===Article 11 – association===
Article 11 protects the right to freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form trade unions, subject to certain restrictions that are &quot;in accordance with law&quot; and &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot;.
* &quot;Vogt v. Germany&quot; (1995)
* &quot;Yazar, Karatas, Aksoy and Hep v. Turkey&quot; (2003) 36 EHRR 59
* &quot;Bączkowski v. Poland&quot; (2005)

===Article 12 – marriage===
Article 12 provides a right for women and men of marriageable age to marry and establish a family.

Despite a number of invitations, the court has so far refused to apply the protections of this article to same-sex marriage. The court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.

In &quot;Goodwin v. United Kingdom&quot; the court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative transsexual people under their pre-operative sex violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual people were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in &quot;Rees v. United Kingdom&quot;. This did not, however, alter the Court&#x27;s understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in &quot;Schalk and Kopf v. Austria&quot; that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples; however, if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face, in order to prevent a breach of article 14 – the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of &quot;Oliari and Others v. Italy&quot; that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.

===Article 13 – effective remedy===
Article 13 provides for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the convention.

===Article 14 – discrimination===

Article 14 contains a prohibition of discrimination. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on &quot;sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status&quot;, the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person&#x27;s sexual orientation.

At the same time, the article&#x27;s protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex – Article 14 – in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression – Article 10).

Protocol 12 extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right, even when that legal right is not protected under the convention, so long as it is provided for in national law.

===Article 15 – derogations===

Article 15 allows contracting states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the convention in a time of &quot;war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation&quot;. Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:

# there must be a public emergency threatening the life of the nation;
# any measures taken in response must be &quot;strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&quot;; and
# the measures taken in response to it must be in compliance with a state&#x27;s other obligations under international law.

In addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation and any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.

As of 2016, only eight member states had ever invoked derogations. The court is quite permissive in accepting a state&#x27;s derogations from the convention but applies a higher degree of scrutiny in deciding whether measures taken by states under a derogation are, in the words of Article 15, &quot;strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&quot;. Thus in &quot;A v United Kingdom&quot;, the court dismissed a claim that a derogation lodged by the British government in response to the September 11 attacks was invalid, but went on to find that measures taken by the United Kingdom under that derogation were disproportionate.

Examples of such derogations include:
* In the 1969 Greek case, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the derogation was invalid because the alleged Communist subversion did not pose a sufficient threat. This is the only time to date that the convention system has rejected an attempted derogation.
* Operation Demetrius—Internees arrested without trial pursuant to &quot;Operation Demetrius&quot; could not complain to the European Commission of Human Rights about breaches of Article 5 because on 27 June 1957, the UK lodged a notice with the Council of Europe declaring that there was a &quot;public emergency within the meaning of Article 15(1) of the Convention&quot;.

===Article 16 – foreign parties===
Article 16 allows states to restrict the political activity of foreigners. The court has ruled that European Union member states cannot consider the nationals of other member states to be aliens.

===Article 17 – abuse of rights===
Article 17 provides that no one may use the rights guaranteed by the convention to seek the abolition or limitation of rights guaranteed in the convention. This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right in the name of another human right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).
* &quot;Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany&quot; (1957), the Commission refused to consider the appeal by the Communist Party of Germany, stating that the communist doctrine advocated by them is incompatible with the convention, citing article 17&#x27;s limitations on the rights to the extent necessarily to prevent their subversion by adherents of a totalitarian doctrine.

===Article 18 – permitted restrictions===

Article 18 provides that any limitations on the rights provided for in the convention may be used only for the purpose for which they are provided. For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.

==Convention protocols==
, fifteen protocols to the convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected. The former require unanimous ratification by member states before coming into force, while the latter require a certain number of states to sign before coming into force.

===Protocol 1===
This Protocol contains three different rights which the signatories could not agree to place in the convention itself. Monaco and Switzerland have signed but never ratified Protocol 1.

====Article 1 – property====
Article 1 (&quot;A1P1&quot;) provides that &quot;every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions&quot;. The European Court of Human Rights acknowledged a violation of the fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual&#x27;s fundamental rights, also, in the uncertainty – for the owner – about the future of the property, and in the absence of an allowance.

In the case of &quot;Mifsud and others v Malta&quot; (38770/17) the Maltese state was found to have violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the convention. The case involved a plot of land owned by the Mifsud family and their heirs which was expropriated twice (in 1984 and in 2012). The court, in its judgment, stated that &quot;the (Maltese) Constitutional Court had no basis on which to ground its finding. The Court is disconcerted by the circumstances of the present case which led to an expropriation of property being endorsed without anyone being able to assert the reasons behind such an expropriation.&quot;

====Article 2 – education====
Article 2 provides for the right not to be denied an education and the right for parents to have their children educated in accordance with their religious and other views. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.

Although phrased in the Protocol as a negative right, in &quot;Şahin v. Turkey&quot; the court ruled that:
====Article 3 – elections====
Article 3 provides for the right to elections performed by secret ballot, that are also free and that occur at regular intervals.
* &quot;Matthews v. United Kingdom&quot; (1999) 28 EHRR 361

===Protocol 4 – civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion===
Article 1 prohibits the imprisonment of people for inability to fulfil a contract. Article 2 provides for a right to freely move within a country once lawfully there and for a right to leave any country. Article 3 prohibits the expulsion of nationals and provides for the right of an individual to enter a country of their nationality. Article 4 prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners.

Turkey and the United Kingdom have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s failure to ratify this protocol is due to concerns over the interaction of Article 2 and Article 3 with British nationality law. Specifically, several classes of &quot;British national&quot; (such as British National (Overseas)) do not have the right of abode in the United Kingdom and are subject to immigration control there. In 2009, the UK government stated that it had no plans to ratify Protocol 4 because of concerns that those articles could be taken as conferring that right.

===Protocol 6 – restriction of death penalty===
Requires parties to restrict the application of the death penalty except for &quot;acts committed in time of war&quot; or of &quot;imminent threat of war&quot;.

Every Council of Europe member state has signed and ratified Protocol 6.

===Protocol 7 – crime and family===
* Article 1 provides for a right to fair procedures for lawfully resident foreigners facing expulsion.
* Article 2 provides for the right to appeal in criminal matters.
* Article 3 provides for compensation for the victims of miscarriages of justice.
* Article 4 prohibits the re-trial of anyone who has already been finally acquitted or convicted of a particular offence (double jeopardy).
* Article 5 provides for equality between spouses.

Despite having signed the protocol more than thirty years ago Germany and the Netherlands have never ratified it. Turkey, which signed the protocol in 1985, ratified it in 2016, becoming the latest member state to do so. The United Kingdom has neither signed nor ratified the protocol.

===Protocol 12 – discrimination===

Protocol 12 applies the current expansive and indefinite grounds of prohibited discrimination in Article 14 to the exercise of any legal right and to the actions (including the obligations) of public authorities.

The Protocol entered into force on 1 April 2005 and has () been ratified by 20 member states. Several member states—Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Lithuania, Monaco, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom—have not signed the protocol.

The United Kingdom government has declined to sign Protocol 12 on the basis that they believe the wording of protocol is too wide and would result in a flood of new cases testing the extent of the new provision. They believe that the phrase &quot;rights set forth by law&quot; might include international conventions to which the UK is not a party, and would result in incorporation of these instruments by stealth.

It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a catch-22, since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the European Court of Human Rights has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe&#x27;s most populous states—including the UK—not to ratify the protocol. The UK government, nevertheless, stated in 2004 that it &quot;agrees in principle that the ECHR should contain a provision against discrimination that is free-standing and not parasitic on the other Convention rights&quot;. The first judgment that found a violation of Protocol No. 12, &quot;Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;, was delivered in 2009.

===Protocol 13 – complete abolition of death penalty===
Protocol 13 provides for the total abolition of the death penalty. Currently all Council of Europe member states but Azerbaijan have ratified Protocol 13.

===Procedural and institutional protocols===
The convention&#x27;s provisions affecting institutional and procedural matters have been altered several times by means of protocols. These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention. Protocol 2 did not amend the text of the convention as such but stipulated that it was to be treated as an integral part of the text. All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.

====Protocol 11====
Protocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998. It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter&#x27;s structure. Previously states could ratify the convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.

====Protocol 14====

Protocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the court. It seeks to &quot;filter&quot; out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a &quot;significant disadvantage&quot;. This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.

A new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The committee can ask the court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for European Union accession to the convention. The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010. It entered into force on 1 June 2010.

A provisional Protocol 14bis had been opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised to allow the court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.

<text>The Eureka Rebellion was a series of events involving gold miners who revolted against the British administration of the colony of Victoria, Australia, during the Victorian gold rush. It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat between the rebels and the colonial forces of Australia. The fighting resulted in an official total of 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. There was a preceding period beginning in 1851 of peaceful demonstrations and civil disobedience on the Victorian goldfields. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced.

Tensions began in 1851, with the introduction of a tax on gold mines. Miners began to organize and protest the taxes; miners stopped paying the taxes en masse. The October 1854 murder of a gold miner, and the burning of a local hotel (which miners blamed on the government), ended the previously peaceful nature of the miners&#x27; dispute. Open rebellion broke out on 29 November 1854, as a crowd of some 10,000 swore allegiance to the Eureka Flag. Gold miner Peter Lalor became the rebellion&#x27;s de facto leader, as he had initiated the swearing of allegiance. The Battle of Eureka Stockade ended the short-lived rebellion on 3 December. A group of 13 captured rebels (not including Lalor, who was in hiding) was put on trial for high treason in Melbourne, but mass public support led to their acquittal.

The legacy of the Rebellion is contested. Rebel leader Peter Lalor was elected to the parliament in 1856, though he proved to be less of an ally to the common man than expected. Several reforms sought by the rebels were subsequently implemented, including legislation providing for universal adult male suffrage for Legislative Assembly elections and the removal of property qualifications for Legislative Assembly members. The Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by many as a political revolt.

== Origins in the Victorian gold rush ==
The Eureka Rebellion had its origins in the Australian gold rush that began in 1851. Following the separation of Victoria from New South Wales on 1 July 1851, gold prospectors were offered 200 guineas for making discoveries within of Melbourne. In August 1851, the news was received around the world that, on top of several earlier finds, Thomas Hiscock had found still more deposits west of Buninyong.

This led to gold fever taking hold as the colony&#x27;s population increased from 77,000 in 1851 to 198,496 in 1853. In three years, the total number of people living in and around the Victorian goldfields stood at a 12-month average of 100,351. In 1851, the Australian population was 430,000. In 1871, it was 1.7 million. Among this number was &quot;a heavy sprinkling of ex-convicts, gamblers, thieves, rogues and vagabonds of all kinds&quot;. The local authorities soon found themselves with fewer police and lacked the infrastructure needed to support the expansion of the mining industry. The number of public servants, factory and farm workers leaving for the goldfields to seek their fortune made for chronic labour shortages that needed to be resolved.

=== Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854 ===
====La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin====
On 16 August 1851, just days after Hiscock&#x27;s lucky strike, Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe issued two proclamations that reserved to the crown all land rights to the goldfields and introduced a mining licence (tax) of 30 shillings per month, effective 1 September. The universal mining tax was based on time stayed rather than what was seen as the more equitable option, an export duty levied only on gold found, meaning it was always designed to make life unprofitable for most prospectors.

There were several mass public meetings and miners&#x27; delegations in the years leading up to the armed revolt. The earliest rally was held on 26 August 1851 at Hiscock&#x27;s Gully in Buninyong and attracted 40–50 miners protesting the new mining regulations, and four resolutions to this end were passed. From the outset, there was a division between the &quot;moral force&quot; activists who favoured lawful, peaceful and democratic means and those who advocated &quot;physical force&quot;, with some in attendance suggesting that the miners take up arms against the lieutenant governor, who was irreverently viewed as a feather-wearing, effeminate fop. This first meeting was followed by ongoing protests across all the colony&#x27;s mining settlements in the years leading up to the 1854 armed uprising at Ballarat.

====First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat====

In mid-September 1851, D. C. Doveton, the first local gold commissioner appointed by La Trobe, arrived in Ballarat. At the beginning of December, there was discontent when it was announced that the licence fee would be raised to 3 pounds a month, a 200 per cent increase, effective 1 January 1852. In Ballarat, some miners became so agitated that they began to gather arms. On 8 December, the rebellion continued to build momentum with an anti-mining tax banner put on public display at Forrest Creek.

After remonstrations, particularly in Melbourne and Geelong, on 13 December 1851, the previous increase was rescinded. The Forest Creek Monster Meeting took place at Mount Alexander on 15 December 1851. This was the first truly mass demonstration of the Eureka Rebellion. According to high-end estimates, up to 20,000 miners turned out in a massive display of support for repealing the mining tax. The only pictorial evidence concerning the flag on display at the meeting is an engraving of the scene by Thomas Ham and David Tulloch that features only part of the design. 

Based on the research of Doug Ralph, Marjorie Theobald and others have questioned whether there was an iconic Digger&#x27;s flag displayed at Forest Creek that spread to other mining settlements.

Two days later, it was announced that La Trobe had reversed the planned increase in the mining tax. The oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency, causing general dissent among the diggers. There was strong opposition to the strict prohibition of liquor imposed by the government at the goldfields settlements, whereby the sale and consumption of alcohol were restricted to licensed hotels.

Despite the high turnover in population on the goldfields, discontent continued to simmer throughout 1852. La Trobe received a petition from the people of Bendigo on 2 September 1862, drawing attention to the need for improvements in the road from Melbourne. The lack of police protection was also a major issue for the protesting miners. On 14 August 1852, a fight broke out among 150 men over land rights in Bendigo. An inquiry recommended increasing police numbers in the colony&#x27;s mining settlements. Around this time, the first gold deposits at the Eureka lead in Ballarat were found.

In October 1852, at Lever Flat near Bendigo, the miners attempted to respond to rising crime levels by forming a &quot;Mutual Protection Association&quot;. They pledged to withhold the licence fee, build detention centres, and begin nightly armed patrols, with vigilantes dispensing summary justice to those suspected of criminal activities. That month, Government House received a petition from Lever Flat, Forrest Creek and Mount Alexander about policing levels as the colony continued to strain due to the gold rush. On 25 November 1852, a police patrol was attacked by a mob of miners who wrongly believed they were obliged to take out a whole month&#x27;s subscription for seven days at Oven&#x27;s goldfield in Bendigo.

In 1852, it was decided by the UK government that the Australian colonies should each draft their own constitutions, pending final approval by the Imperial parliament in London.

====Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement====

The disquiet on the goldfields continued in 1853, with public meetings held in Castlemaine, Heathcote and Bendigo. On 3 February 1853, a policeman accidentally caused the death of William Guest at Reid&#x27;s Creek. Assistant Commissioner James Clow had to defuse a difficult situation with a promise to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances. A group of one thousand angry miners overran the government camp and relieved the police of their sidearms and weapons, destroying a cache of weapons. George Black assisted Dr John Owens in chairing a public meeting held at Ovens field on 11 February 1853 that called for the death of Guest to be fully investigated.

The Anti-Gold Licence Association was formed in June at a meeting in Bendigo, where 23,000 signatures were collected for a mass petition, including 8,000 from the mining settlement at McIvor.

There was an incident on 2 July 1853 in which police were assaulted in the vicinity of an anti-licence meeting at the Sandhurst goldfield in Bendigo, with rocks being thrown as they escorted an intoxicated miner to the holding cells. On 16 July 1853, an anti-licence demonstration in Sandhurst attracted 6,000 people, who also raised the issue of lack of electoral rights. The high commissioner of the goldfields, William Wright, advised La Trobe of his support for an export duty on gold found rather than the existing universal tax on all prospectors based on time stayed.

On 3 August, the Bendigo petition was placed before La Trobe, who refused to act on a request to suspend the mining tax again and give the miners the right to vote. The next day, there was a meeting held at Protestant Hall in Melbourne where the delegation reported on the exchange with La Trobe. The crowd reacted with &quot;loud disapprobation and showers of hisses&quot; when the lieutenant governor was mentioned. Manning Clark speaks of one of the leaders of the &quot;moral force&quot; faction, George Thompson, who returned to Bendigo, where he attended another meeting on 28 July. Formerly, there was talk of &quot;moral suasion&quot; and &quot;the genius of the English people to compose their differences without resort to violence&quot;. Thompson pointed to the Union Jack and jokingly said that &quot;if the flag went, it would be replaced by a diggers&#x27; flag&quot;.

The Bendigo &quot;diggers flag&quot; was unfurled at a rally at View Point, Sandhurst, on 12 August 1853 to hear from delegates who had returned from Melbourne with news of the failure of the Bendigo petition. The miners paraded under the flags of several nations, including the Irish tricolour, the saltire of Scotland, the Union Jack, revolutionary French and German flags, and the Stars and Stripes. The &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; reported that:

The design of the Digger&#x27;s flag was along the same lines as the flag flown at Forrest Creek in 1851. It has four quarters that feature a pick, shovel and cradle, symbolising the mining industry; a bundle of sticks tied together, symbolising unity; the scales of justice, symbolising the remedies the miners sought; and a Kangaroo and Emu, symbolising Australia.

On 20 August 1853, just as an angry mob of 500–600 miners went to assemble outside the government camp at Waranga, the authorities used a legal technicality to release some mining tax evaders. A meeting in Beechworth called for reducing the licence fee to ten shillings and voting rights for the mining settlements. A larger rally attended by 20,000 people was held at Hospital Hill in Bendigo on 23 August 1853, which resolved to support a mining tariff fixed at 10 shillings a month.

There was a second multinational-style assembly at View Point on 27 August 1853. The next day a procession of miners passed by the government camp with the sounds of bands and shouting and fifty pistol rounds as an assembly of about 2,000 miners took place. On 29 August 1853, assistant commissioner Robert William Rede at Jones Creek counselled that a peaceful, political solution could still be found. In Ballarat, miners offered to surround the guard tent to protect gold reserves amid rumours of a planned robbery.

A sitting of the goldfields committee of the Legislative Council in Melbourne on 6 September 1853 heard from goldfields activists Dr William Carr, W Fraser and William Jones. &quot;An Act for the Better Management of the Goldfields&quot; was passed, which, upon receiving royal assent on 1 December, reduced the licence fee to 40 shillings for every three months. The act featured increasing fines in the order of 5, 10 and 15 pounds for repeat offenders, with goldfields residents required to carry their permits, which had to be available for inspection at all times. This temporarily relieved tensions in the colony. In November, the select committee bill proposed a licence fee of 1 pound for one month, 2 pounds for three months, 3 for six months and 5 pounds for 12 months, along with extending the voting franchise and land rights to the miners. La Trobe amended the scheme by increasing the six-month licence to 4 pounds, with a fee of 8 pounds for 12 months.

On 3 December 1853, a crowd of 2,000–3,000 attended an anti-licence rally at View Point. Then, on 31 December 1854, about 500 people gathered there to elect a so-called &quot;Diggers Congress&quot;.

====Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry====

La Trobe decided to cancel the September 1853 mining tax collections. The Legislative Council supported a Commission of Inquiry into goldfields grievances. It also considered a proposal to abolish the licence fee in return for a royalty on the gold and a nominal charge for maintaining the police service. In November, it was resolved by the Legislative Council that the licence fee be reinstated on a sliding scale of 1 pound per month, 2 pounds per three months, 4 pounds for six months, and 8 pounds for 12 months. License evasion was punishable by increasing fines of 5, 15 and 30 pounds, with serial offenders liable to be sentenced to imprisonment. Licence inspections, treated as a great sport and &quot;carried out in the style of an English fox-hunt&quot; by mounted officials, known to the miners by the warning call &quot;Traps&quot; or &quot;Joes&quot;, were henceforth able to take place at any time without notice.

The latter sobriquet was a reference to La Trobe, whose proclamations posted around the goldfields were signed and sealed &quot;Walter Joseph Latrobe&quot;. Many of the police were former convicts from Tasmania. They would get a fifty per cent commission from all fines imposed on unlicensed miners and grog sellers. Plainclothes officers enforced prohibition, and those involved in the illegal sale of alcohol were initially handed 50-pound fines. Subsequent offences were punishable by months of hard labour. This led to the corrupt practice of police demanding blackmail of 5 pounds from repeat offenders.

Miners were arrested for not carrying licences on their person, as they often left them in their tents due to the typically wet and dirty conditions in the mines, then subjected to such indignities as being chained to trees and logs overnight. The impost was most felt by a greater number of miners, who were finding the mining tax untenable without any more significant gold discoveries.

In March 1854, La Trobe sent a reform package to the Legislative Council, which was adopted and sent to London for the approval of the Imperial parliament. The voting franchise would be extended to all miners upon purchasing a 12-month permit.

====Hotham replaces La Trobe====

La Trobe&#x27;s successor as lieutenant-governor, Sir Charles Hotham, who took up his commission in Victoria on 22 June 1854. He instructed Rede to introduce a strict enforcement system and conduct a weekly cycle of licence hunts, which it was hoped would cause the exodus to the goldfields to be reversed. In August 1854, Hotham and his wife were received in Ballarat during a tour of the Victorian goldfields. In September, Hotham imposed more frequent twice-weekly licence hunts, with more than half of the prospectors on the goldfields remaining non-compliant with the regulations.

The miners in Bendigo responded to the increase in the frequency of licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.

== Tensions escalate ==

=== Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel ===
In October 1854 James Scobie was murdered outside the Eureka Hotel. Johannes Gregorius was prosecuted for the murder. A colonial inquest found no evidence of culpability by the Bentley Hotel owners for the fatal injuries amid allegations that Magistrate D&#x27;Ewes had a conflict of interest presiding over a case involving the prosecution of Bentley, said to be a friend and indebted business partner.

Gregorius, a physically disabled servant who worked for Father Smyth of St Alipius chapel, had been in the past subjected to police brutality and false arrest for licence evasion, even though he was exempt from the requirement. On 15 October, a mass meeting of predominantly Catholic miners took place on Bakery Hill in protest over the treatment of Gregorius. Two days later, responding to the acquittal, a meeting of approximately 10,000 men occurred near the Eureka Hotel in protest. The hotel was set alight as Rede was pelted with eggs. The available security forces were unable to restore order.

On 21 October, Andrew McIntyre and Thomas Fletcher were arrested for the arson attack on the Eureka Hotel. A third man, John Westerby, was also indicted. A committee meeting of miners on Bakery Hill agreed to indemnify the bail sureties for McIntyre and Fletcher. As a large mob approached the government camp, the two men were hurriedly released under their own recognisance.

Around this time two reward notices were distributed around Ballarat. One offered a 500-pound reward for information leading to an arrest in the Scobie murder case. The other announced the reward for more information about the Bank of Victoria heist in Ballarat that was carried out by robbers wearing black crepe-paper masks, and which was increased from 500 to 1,600 pounds. Rede received a miner&#x27;s delegation on 23 October which had heard that the police officers involved in the arrest of Gregorius would be dismissed. Two days later, a meeting led by Timothy Hayes and John Manning heard reports from the deputies sent to negotiate with Rede. The meeting resolved to petition Hotham for a retrial of Gregorius and to the reassignment of the assistant commissioner Johnston away from Ballarat.

On 27 October, Captain John Wellesley Thomas laid contingency plans for the defence of the government outpost. In the weeks leading up to the battle, men had already been aiming musket balls at the barely fortified barracks during the night. On 30 October, Hotham appointed a board of enquiry into the murder of James Scobie to sit in Ballarat on 2 and 10 November. The panel included Melbourne magistrate Evelyn Sturt, assisted by his local magistrate Charles Hackett and William McCrea. After receiving representations from the US consul, Hotham released James Tarleton from custody.

The inquiry into the Ballarat rioting concluded with a statement made on 10 November in the name of the Ballarat Reform League that was signed by John Basson Humffray, Fredrick Vern, Henry Ross and Samuel Irwin of the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot;. The final report agreed with the League&#x27;s submission, blaming the government camp for the unsatisfactory state of affairs. The recommendation that Magistrate Dewes and Sergeant Major-Milne of the constabulary should be dismissed was acted upon.

On 1 November, around 5,000 miners gathered in Bendigo, as a plan was drawn up to organise the diggers at all the mining settlements, with speakers openly advocating physical force addressing the crowd.

=== Ballarat Reform League meetings ===

On 11 November 1854, a crowd of more than 10,000 gathered at Bakery Hill, directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was formally established under the chairmanship of Chartist John Humffray. (Several other reform league leaders, including George Black, Henry Holyoake, and Tom Kennedy, are also believed to have been Chartists.) It was reported by the &quot;Ballarat Times&quot; that at the appointed hour, the &quot;Union Jack and the American ensign were hoisted as signals for the people to assemble&quot;. It was at this time the Union Jack became a national flag while being &quot;inscribed with slogans as a protest flag of the Chartist movement in the nineteenth century&quot;.

The Ballarat Reform League charter was inspired by the charter ratified at the 1839 Chartist National Convention held in London. The Ballarat charter contains five of the same demands as the London one. The Ballarat league did not adopt the Chartist&#x27;s sixth demand: secret ballots. The meeting passed a resolution &quot;that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey, that taxation without representation is tyranny&quot;. The meeting resolved to secede from the United Kingdom if the situation did not improve.

Throughout the following weeks, the league sought to negotiate with Rede and Hotham on the specific matters relating to Bentley and the death of James Scobie, the men being tried for the burning of the Eureka Hotel, the broader issues of the abolition of the licence, suffrage and democratic representation of the goldfields, and the disbanding of the gold commission.

Hotham sent a message to England on 16 November which revealed his intention to establish an inquiry into goldfields grievances. Notes to the royal commissioners had already been made on 6 November, where Hotham stated his opposition to an export duty on gold replacing the universal mining tax. W. C. Haines MLC was to be the chairman, serving alongside lawmakers John Fawkner, John O&#x27;Shanassy, William Westgarth, as well as chief gold commissioner William Wright. These men were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.

Rather than hear the Ballarat Reform League&#x27;s grievances, Rede increased the police presence on the Ballarat goldfields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne. Rede told one deputation that their campaign against &quot;The licence is a mere cloak to cover a democratic revolution&quot;, and the day before the battle reported to the chief gold commissioner that the government forces stood ready to &quot;crush them and the democratic agitation at one blow&quot;.

The James Scobie murder trial ended on 18 November 1854, with the accused, James Bentley, Thomas Farrell and William Hance, being convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to three years of hard labour on a road crew. Catherine Bentley was acquitted. Two days later, the miners Westerby, Fletcher and McIntyre were convicted for burning the Eureka Hotel and were sentenced to jail terms of six, four and three months.

The jury recommended the prerogative of mercy be evoked and noted that they held the local authorities in Ballarat responsible for the loss of property. One week later, a reform league delegation, including Humffray, met with Hotham, Stawell and Foster to negotiate the release of the three Eureka Hotel rioters. Hotham declared that he would take a stand on the word &quot;demand&quot;, satisfied that due process had been observed. Father Smyth informed Rede in confidence that he believed the miners might be about to march on the government outpost.

=== Escalating violence as military convoy looted ===
Foot police reinforcements arrived in Ballarat on 19 October 1854. A further detachment of the 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot arrived a few days behind. On 28 November, the 12th (East Suffolk) Regiment of Foot arrived to reinforce the government camp in Ballarat. As they moved alongside where the Eureka Stockade was about to be erected, members of the convoy were attacked by a mob looking to loot the wagons.

By the beginning of December, the police contingent at Ballarat had been surpassed by the number of soldiers from the 12th and 40th regiments. The strength of the various units in the government camp was: 40th regiment (infantry): 87 men; 40th regiment (mounted): 30 men; 12th regiment (infantry): 65 men; mounted police: 70 men; and the foot police: 24 men.

== Open rebellion ==

=== Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross ===
On 29 November, a meeting involving a crowd of around 10,000 was held at Bakery Hill. The miners heard from their deputies news of the unsuccessful outcome of their meeting with Hotham demanding the release of Westerby, Fletcher and McIntyre.

The Eureka Flag was flown there for the first time. The crowd was incited by Timothy Hayes shouting, &quot;Are you ready to die?&quot; and Fredrick Vern, who was accused of abandoning the garrison four days later as soon as the danger arrived, with suspicions of being a double agent.

Rede responded by ordering police to conduct a licence search on 30 November. There was further rioting where objects were thrown at military and law enforcement by the protesting miners who had refused to cooperate with licence inspections &quot;en masse&quot;. Eight licence defaulters were arrested, and most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the angry mob that had assembled.

There was another gathering on Bakery Hill where a militant leader, Peter Lalor, moved that a central rebel executive be formed. He proclaimed &quot;liberty&quot; and called for volunteers to step forward and be sworn into companies and captains to be appointed.

Lalor knelt, pointed to the Eureka Flag, and swore to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators: &quot;We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties&quot;.

In a dispatch dated 20 December 1854, Hotham reported: &quot;The disaffected miners ... held a meeting whereat the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows offered for its defence&quot;.

==== Fortification of the Eureka lead ====

After the oath swearing ceremony, about 1,000 rebels marched in double file from Bakery Hill to the Eureka lead behind the Eureka Flag being carried by Henry Ross, where construction of the stockade took place between 30 November and 2 December. There were existing mines within the stockade. The stockade consisted of diagonal wooden spikes made from materials including pit props and overturned horse carts. It encompassed an area said to be one acre. Other estimates give the dimensions of the stockade as x . Contemporaneous descriptions and representations vary and have the stockade as either rectangular or semi-circular.

Lalor later said the stockade &quot;was nothing more than an enclosure to keep our own men together, and was never erected with an eye to military defence&quot;. Peter FitzSimons asserts that Lalor may have downplayed the fact that the Eureka Stockade was intended as something of a fortress at a time when &quot;it was very much in his interests&quot; to do so. The construction work was overseen by Vern, who had apparently received instruction in military methods. John Lynch wrote that his &quot;military learning comprehended the whole system of warfare ... fortification was his strong point&quot;.

Other descriptions of the stockade contradicted Lalor&#x27;s recollection of it being a simple fence after the fall of the stockade. Testimony was heard at the high treason trials for the Eureka rebels that the stockade was four to seven feet high in places and was unable to be negotiated on horseback without being reduced.

Hotham feared that the &quot;network of rabbit burrows&quot; on the goldfields would prove readily defensible as his forces &quot;on the rough pot-holed ground would be unable to advance in regular formation and would be picked off easily by snipers&quot;. These considerations were part of the reasoning behind the decision to move into position in the early morning for a surprise attack. Carboni details the rebel dispositions:

The location of the stockade has been described as &quot;appalling from a defensive point of view&quot;, as it was situated on &quot;a gentle slope, which exposed a sizeable portion of its interior to fire from nearby high ground&quot;. A detachment of 800 men, which included &quot;two field pieces and two howitzers&quot; was under the commander in chief of the British forces in Australia, Major General Sir Robert Nickle. Nickle himself, who had seen action during the 1798 Irish rebellion, arrived after the insurgency had been put down. In 1860, Withers stated in a lecture that &quot;The site was most injudicious for any purpose of defence as it was easily commanded from adjacent spots, and the ease with which the place could be taken was apparent to the most unprofessional eye&quot;.

At 4 am on the morning of 1 December, the rebels were observed to be massing on Bakery Hill, but a government raiding party found the area vacated. Again, Rede ordered the riot act read to a mob that had gathered around Bath&#x27;s Hotel, with mounted police breaking up the unlawful assembly. Raffaello Carboni, George Black and Father Smyth met with Rede to present a peace proposal. Rede was suspicious of the Chartist undercurrent of the anti-mining tax movement and he rejected the proposals.

The rebels sent out scouts and established picket lines in order to have advance warning of Rede&#x27;s movements. Messengers were dispatched to other mining settlements, including Bendigo and Creswick, requesting reinforcements for the Eureka Stockade. The &quot;moral force&quot; faction, led by Humffray, had withdrawn from the protest movement the previous day, as the men advocating violence moved into the ascendancy. The rebels continued to fortify their position as 300–400 men arrived from Creswick&#x27;s Creek to join the struggle. Carboni recalls they were: &quot;dirty and ragged, and proved the greatest nuisance...&quot;. The arrival of these reinforcements required the dispatch of foraging parties, leaving a garrison of around 200 men behind. Teddy Shanahan, a merchant whose store on the Eureka lead had been engulfed by the stockade, said the rebels immediately became very short on food, drink.

===== Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade =====

&quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper of 4 December 1854 reported that the Union Jack &quot;had&quot; to be hoisted underneath the Eureka Flag at the stockade and that both flags were in possession of the foot police. Peter FitzSimons has questioned whether this contemporaneous report of the otherwise unaccounted-for Union Jack known as the Eureka Jack being present is accurate. Among those willing to credit the first report of the battle as being true and correct it has been theorised that the hoisting of a Union Jack at the stockade was possibly an 11th-hour response to the divided loyalties among the heterogeneous rebel force which was in the process of dissipating.

At one point up to 1,500 of 17,280 men in Ballarat were garrisoning the stockade, with as few as 120 taking part in the battle. Lalor&#x27;s choice of password for the night of 2 December—&quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;—caused support for the rebellion to fall away among those who were otherwise disposed to resist the military, as word spread that the question of Irish home rule had become involved. One survivor of the battle stated that &quot;the collapse of the rising at Ballarat may be regarded as mainly attributable to the password given by Lalor on the night before the assault&quot;. Asked by one of his subordinates for the &quot;night pass&quot;, he gave &quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;, the site of a battle during the 1798 Irish rebellion. The 1804 Castle Hill uprising, also known as the second battle of Vinegar Hill, was the site of a convict rebellion in the colony of New South Wales, involving mainly Irish transportees, some of whom were at Vinegar Hill.

William Craig recalled that &quot;Many at Ballaarat, who were disposed before that to resist the military, now quietly withdrew from the movement&quot;. In his memoirs, Lynch states: &quot;On the afternoon of Saturday we had a force of seven hundred men on whom we thought we could rely&quot;. There was a false alarm from the picket line during the night. The subsequent roll call revealed there had been a sizable desertion that Lynch says &quot;ought to have been seriously considered, but it was not&quot;.

There were rebellious miners converging on Ballarat from Bendigo, Forrest Creek, and Creswick to take part in the armed struggle. The latter contingent was said to number a thousand men, &quot;but when the news circulated that Irish independence had crept into the movement, almost all turned back&quot;. FitzSimons points out that although the number of reinforcements converging on Ballarat was probably closer to 500, there is no doubt that as a result of the choice of password &quot;the Stockade is denied many strong-armed men because of the feeling that the Irish have taken over&quot;. Withers states that:

It is certain that Irish-born people were strongly represented at the Eureka Stockade. Most of the rebels inside the stockade at the time of the battle were Irish, and the area where the defensive position was established was overwhelmingly populated by Irish miners. Blainey has advanced the view that the white cross of the Eureka Flag is &quot;really an Irish cross rather than being [a] configuration of the Southern Cross&quot;.

There is another theory advanced by Gregory Blake, military historian and author of &quot;Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle&quot;, who concedes that two flags may have been flown on the day of the battle, as the miners were claiming to be defending their British rights.

In a signed contemporaneous affidavit dated 7 December 1854, Private Hugh King, who was at the battle serving with the 40th regiment, recalled that:

There was a further report in &quot;The Argus&quot;, 9 December 1854 edition, stating that Hugh King had given live testimony at the committal hearings for the Eureka rebels where he stated that the flag was found:

Blake leaves open the possibility that the flag being carried by the prisoner had been souvenired from the flag pole as the routed garrison was fleeing the stockade.

===== Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind =====

Amid the rising number of rebels absent without leave throughout 2 December, a contingent of 200 Americans under James McGill arrived at 4 pm. Styled as &quot;The Independent Californian Rangers&#x27; Revolver Brigade&quot;, they had horses and were equipped with sidearms and Mexican knives. In a fateful decision, McGill took most of his two hundred Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements from Melbourne. Many Saturday night revellers within the rebel garrison returned to their own tents, assuming that the government camp would not attack on the Sabbath day. A small contingent of miners remained at the stockade overnight, which the spies reported to Rede. Common estimates for the size of the garrison at the time of the attack on 3 December range from 120 to 150 men.

According to Lalor&#x27;s reckoning: &quot;There were about 70 men possessing guns, 30 with pikes and 30 with pistols, but many had no more than one or two rounds of ammunition. Their coolness and bravery were admirable when it is considered that the odds were 3 to 1 against&quot;. Lalor&#x27;s command was riddled with informants, and Rede was kept well advised of his movements, particularly through the work of government agents Henry Goodenough and Andrew Peters, who were embedded within the rebel garrison.

Initially outnumbering the government camp considerably, Lalor had already devised a strategy where &quot;if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the heights to the old Canadian Gully, and there we shall make our final stand&quot;. On being brought to battle that day, Lalor stated: &quot;we would have retreated, but it was then too late&quot;.

On the eve of the battle, Father Smyth issued a plea for Catholics to down their arms and attend mass the following day.

=== Battle of the Eureka Stockade ===


Rede planned to send the combined military police formation of 276 men under the command of Captain Thomas to attack the Eureka Stockade when the rebel garrison was observed to be at a low watermark. The police and military had the element of surprise and timed their assault on the stockade for dawn on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath day of rest. The soldiers and police marched off in silence at around 3:30 am Sunday morning after the troopers had drunk the traditional tot of rum.

The British commander used bugle calls to coordinate his forces. The 40th regiment provided covering fire from one end, with mounted police covering the flanks. Enemy contact began at approximately 150 yards as the two columns of regular infantry and the contingent of foot police moved into position. Although Lalor claimed that the government forces fired the first shot, it appears from all the other remaining accounts as if it came from the rebel garrison.

According to Gregory Blake, the fighting in Ballarat on 3 December 1854 was not one-sided and full of indiscriminate murder by the colonial forces. In his memoirs, one of Lalor&#x27;s captains, John Lynch, mentions &quot;some sharp shooting&quot;. For at least 10 minutes, the rebels offered stiff resistance, with ranged fire coming from the Eureka Stockade garrison such that Thomas&#x27;s best formation, the 40th regiment, wavered and had to be rallied. Blake says this is &quot;stark evidence of the effectiveness of the defender&#x27;s fire&quot;.

Eventually, the rebels started to run short of ammunition, and the government advance resumed. The Victorian police contingent led the way over the top as the forlorn hope in a bayonet charge. Lalor had his arm shattered by a musket ball and was secreted away by supporters, with his arm later requiring amputation. The Eureka flag was captured by Constable John King, who volunteered to scale the flagpole, which then snapped. The exact number of casualties cannot be determined. After the battle, the registrar of Ballarat entered the names of 27 people into the Victorian death register. Lalor lists 34 rebel casualties, of which 22 died. In his report, Captain Thomas states that one soldier was killed in action, two died of wounds, and fourteen were wounded.

== Aftermath ==
Blainey has commented that &quot;Every government in the world would probably have counter-attacked in the face of the building of the stockade&quot;. Hotham would receive the news that the government forces had been victorious the same day, with Stawell waiting outside Saint James church, where Hotham was attending a service with Foster. He immediately set about firing up the government printing press to put out placards calling for support from among the colonists.

A state of martial law was proclaimed with no lights allowed in any tent after 8 pm &quot;even though the legal basis for it was dubious&quot;. It was around this time that a number of unprovoked shots were fired from the government camp toward the diggings. Unrelated first-hand accounts variously state that a woman, her infant child and several men were killed or wounded in an episode of indiscriminate shooting.

News of the battle spread quickly to Melbourne and across the goldfields, turning a perceived government military victory in repressing a minor insurrection into a public relations disaster. On 5 December, reinforcements under Major General Nickle arrived at the government camp in Ballarat. Reverend Taylor expected further repression, stating that:

As it happened, Nickle proved to be a wise, considered and even-handed military commander who calmed the tensions and Taylor &quot;found him to be a very affable and kind gentleman&quot;. Evans&#x27; diary records the effect of his conduct as follows:

The same day several thousand people attended a public meeting held in Swanston Street, Melbourne. There were howls of anger when several pro-government motions were proposed. When the seconder of one motion, which called for the maintenance of law and order, framed the issue as &quot;would they support the flag of old England...or the new flag of the Southern Cross&quot;, the speaker was drowned out by groans from the crowd. In response, it was then proposed that restoring order required removing the government that caused the disorder in the first place. Amid cheers from the crowd, the mayor of Melbourne as chairman declared the pro-government motions carried and hastily adjourned the meeting. However, a new chairman was elected, and motions condemning the government and calling for the resignation of Foster were passed.

Foster had acted as the temporary administrator of Victoria during the transition from La Trobe to Hotham. As colonial secretary to the lieutenant governor, he rigorously enforced the mining licence requirement amid the colony&#x27;s budget and labour crisis. Foster had already offered his resignation on 4 December as the protests began, which Hotham accepted a week later.

On 6 December 1854, a 6,000-strong crowd gathered at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral protesting against the government&#x27;s response to the Eureka Rebellion, as a group of 13 rebel prisoners were indicted for treason. Newspapers in the colony characterised it as a brutal overuse of force, in a situation brought about by the actions of government officials, and public condemnation became insurmountable. Letters Patent formally appointing the members of the Royal Commission were signed and sealed on 7 December 1854.

Hotham managed to have an auxiliary force of 1,500 special constables from Melbourne sworn in along with others from Geelong, with his resolve that further &quot;rioting and sedition would be speedily put down&quot;, undeterred by the rebuff his policies had received from the general public. In Ballarat, only one man stepped forward and answered the call to enlist. By the beginning of 1855, normalcy had returned to the streets of Ballarat, with mounted patrols no longer being a feature of daily life.

Among the government officials, although Foster was made a scapegoat for the affair at Eureka, he remained a member of the Legislative Council. He briefly served on the parliamentary executive as treasurer before returning to England in 1857, where he published his speeches on the Eureka Rebellion. Rede was recalled from Ballarat and kept on full pay until 1855. He served as the sheriff at Geelong (1857), Ballarat (1868), and Melbourne (1877) and was the Commandant of the Volunteer Rifles, being the second-in-command at Port Phillip.

In 1880, Rede was sheriff at the trial of Ned Kelly and an official witness to his execution. Hotham was promoted on 22 May 1855 when the title of the colony&#x27;s chief executive was changed from lieutenant governor to governor. He died in Melbourne on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1855 while in a coma after suffering from a severe cold.

=== Trials for sedition and high treason ===
The first trial relating to the rebellion was a charge of sedition against Henry Seekamp of the &quot;Ballarat Times&quot;. Seekamp was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, three months early. During Seekamp&#x27;s absence, Clara served as editor of the &quot;Ballarat Times&quot;.

Of the approximately 120 individuals detained after the battle, thirteen were put on trial for high treason. There were Timothy Hayes, Raffaello Carboni, John Manning, John Joseph, Jan Vennick, James Beattie, Henry Reid, Michael Tuohy, James Macfie Campbell, William Molloy, Jacob Sorenson, Thomas Dignum, and John Phelan.

The African American John Joseph was the first rebel put on trial. Matters of fact were decided by a lay juries drawn from a general public that was largely sympathetic to the rebel cause. One of the junior counsels for Joseph was Butler Cole Aspinall, who appeared pro bono. Formerly chief of parliamentary reporting for &quot;The Argus&quot; before returning to practice, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the wake of the Eureka trials. He received many other criminal briefs later in his legal career, including that of Henry James O&#x27;Farrell, who was indicted for an 1868 assassination attempt on the Duke of Edinburgh in Sydney. Gavan Duffy said of Aspinall that he was: &quot;one of the half-dozen men whose undoubted genius gave the Parliament of Victoria a first place among colonial legislatures&quot;.

The jury&#x27;s verdict of not guilty was greeted by applause, with two men being sentenced to a week in prison for contempt of court. Over 10,000 people had come to hear the jury&#x27;s verdict. Joseph was carried around the streets of Melbourne in a chair in triumph, according to &quot;The Ballarat Star&quot;.

Manning&#x27;s case was heard next. The indicted rebels were acquitted in quick succession, with the last five all being tried together on 27 March. The lead defence counsel Archibald Michie observed that the proceedings had become &quot;weary, stale, flat, dull and unprofitable&quot;. The trials have, on several occasions, been described as a farce.

As Molony points out, the legality of putting a foreign national on trial for treason had been settled as far back as 1649. A difficulty the Crown prosecutor faced regarding the mens rea was that:

The Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell rebuked Hotham over the decision to prosecute the captured rebels, saying in a despatch:

=== Commission of Inquiry report ===
On 14 December 1854, the goldfields commission sat for the first time. The first Ballarat session was held four days later at Bath&#x27;s Hotel. In a meeting with Hotham on 8 January 1855, the goldfields commissioners made an interim recommendation that the mining tax be scrapped, and two days later made a submission advising a general amnesty be granted for all those rebels on the run from the Eureka Stockade.

The commission&#x27;s final report into the Victorian goldfields was presented to Hotham on 27 March 1855. It was scathing in its assessment of the administration of the goldfields, particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. Within 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League were implemented. The changes included the abolition of gold licences to be replaced with an export duty. An annual 1-pound miner&#x27;s right that entitles the holder to voting rights for the lower house and a land deed was introduced. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and there was a reduction in police numbers. The Legislative Council was reconstituted to provide representation for the major gold field settlements.

Concerning the tensions caused by the Chinese presence on the goldfields, the report states inter alia:

The legislative remedy came in the form of a poll tax, assented to on 12 June 1855, made payable by Chinese immigrants.

Humffray commended the report in a letter to the editor, saying:
=== Peter Lalor enters parliament ===
Lalor, in his letter to the colonists of Victoria, lamented that:

In July 1855, the Victorian Constitution received royal assent, which provided for a fully elected bicameral parliament, with a new Legislative Assembly of 60 seats and a reformed Legislative Council of 30 seats. The franchise was available to all holders of the miner&#x27;s right for the inaugural Legislative Assembly election, with members of parliament themselves subject to property qualifications. In the interim, five representatives from the mining settlements were appointed to the old part elected Legislative Council, including Lalor and Hummfray in Ballarat.

Lalor is said to have &quot;aroused hostility among his digger constituents&quot; by not supporting the principle of one vote, one value. He instead preferred the existing property-based franchise and plural voting, where ownership of a certain number of holdings conferred the right to cast multiple ballots. In the event when the &quot;Electoral Act of 1856&quot; (Vic) was enacted, these provisions were not carried forward. Universal adult male suffrage was then introduced in 1857 for Legislative Assembly elections. (That said, property and later ratepaying franchises and hence &#x27;plural voting&#x27; for some persisted: one-person-one-vote was not achieved until 1938 and property qualifications remained until 1950 for the Legislative Council.)

On another occasion, there were 17,745 signatures from Ballarat residents on a petition against a regressive land ownership bill Lalor supported that favoured the &quot;squattocracy&quot;, who came from pioneering families who had acquired their prime agricultural land through occupation and were not of a mind to give up their monopoly on the countryside, nor political representation. He is on record as having been opposed to payment for members of the Legislative Council, which had been another key demand of the Ballarat Reform League. In November 1855, under the new constitutional arrangements, Lalor was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of North Grenville, which he held from 1856 to 1859.

Withers and others have noted that those who considered Lalor a legendary folk hero were surprised that he was more concerned with accumulating styles and estates than securing any gains from the Eureka Rebellion. Lalor was found wanting by a critical mass of his supporters, who had hitherto sustained his political career. Lynch recalls that:

Under pressure from constituents to clarify his position, in a letter dated 1 January 1857 published in the &quot;Ballarat Star&quot;, Lalor described his political ideology in the following terms:

From there on, he never represented a Ballarat-based constituency again. He successfully contested the Melbourne seat of South Grant in the Legislative Assembly in 1859, until being twice defeated at the polls in 1871, on the second occasion contesting the seat of North Melbourne. In 1874, he was again elected as the member for South Grant, which he represented in parliament until he died in 1889.

Lalor served as chairman of committees from 1859 to 1868 before being sworn into the ministry. He was first appointed as Commissioner of Trade and Customs in 1875, an office he held throughout 1877-1880, riding the fortunes of his parliamentary faction. He was briefly Postmaster-General of Victoria from May to July 1877. Lalor served as the speaker from 1880 and 1887. When his health situation forced him to step down, parliament awarded him a sum of 4,000 pounds. Lalor twice refused to accept the highest Imperial honour of a British knighthood.

==Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade==

In 1931, R. S. Reed claimed that &quot;an old tree stump on the south side of Victoria Street, near Humffray Street, is the historic tree at which the pioneer diggers gathered in the days before the Eureka Stockade to discuss their grievances against the officialdom of the time&quot;. Reed called for the formation of a committee of citizens to &quot;beautify the spot, and to preserve the tree stump&quot; upon which Lalor addressed the assembled rebels during the oath swearing ceremony. It was also reported the stump &quot;has been securely fenced in, and the enclosed area is to be planted with floriferous trees. The spot is adjacent to Eureka, which is famed alike for the stockade fight and for the fact that the Welcome Nugget. (sold for £10,500) was discovered in 1858 within a stone&#x27;s throw of it&quot;.

A 2015 report commissioned by the City of Ballarat found that given documentary evidence and its elevation, the most likely location of the oath swearing ceremony is 29 St. Paul&#x27;s Way, Bakery Hill. As of 2016, the area was a car park awaiting residential development.

As the materials used by the rebels to fortify the Eureka lead were quickly removed and the landscape altered by mining, the exact location of the Eureka Stockade is unknown. Various studies have been undertaken that have arrived at different conclusions. In 1994, Jack Harvey conducted an exhaustive survey and concluded that the Eureka Stockade Memorial is situated within the confines of the historical Eureka Stockade.

== Political legacy ==
The actual political significance of the Eureka Rebellion is contested. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of republicanism. Some historians believe that the prominence of the event in the public record has come about because Australian history does not include a major armed rebellion phase equivalent to the French Revolution, the English Civil War, or the American War of Independence, making the Eureka story inflated well beyond its real importance. Others maintain that Eureka was a seminal event and that it marked a major change in the course of Australian history.

In modern times, there have been calls for the official Australian national flag to be replaced by the Eureka Flag.

In his eyewitness account, Carboni stated that &quot;amongst the foreigners ... there was no democratic feeling, but merely a spirit of resistance to the licence fee&quot;. He also disputes the accusations &quot;that have branded the miners of Ballarat as disloyal to their QUEEN&quot;.

American author Mark Twain, who journeyed to Ballarat, noted how the Eureka Rebellion was well remembered by locals, likening it to the battles of Concord and Battle of Lexington in his 1897 travel book &quot;Following the Equator&quot;. Concerning the legacy of the battle, he stated: 

H. V. Evatt, leader of the ALP, wrote that &quot;Australian democracy was born at Eureka&quot;. Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies said, &quot;the Eureka revolution was an earnest attempt at democratic government&quot;. Ben Chifley, former ALP Prime Minister, believed the Eureka Rebellion was not just a &quot;short-lived revolt against tyrannical authority&quot; and expressed the view that it was consequential in terms of Australia&#x27;s development as a nation in that &quot;it was the first real affirmation of our determination to be masters of our own political destiny&quot;.

Blainey has described Evatt&#x27;s view as &quot;slightly inflammatory&quot; for such reasons as the first parliamentary elections in Australian history actually took place in South Australia, albeit according to a more limited property-based franchise, observing that it had been a battle cry for nationalists, republicans, liberals, radicals, and communists with &quot;each creed finding in the rebellion the lessons they liked to see&quot;. He acknowledged that the inaugural parliament that convened under Victoria&#x27;s revised constitution &quot;was alert to the democratic spirit of the goldfields&quot;. The parliament eventually passed laws that enabled all adult males to vote by secret ballot and contest Legislative Assembly elections. He points out that many miners were temporary migrants from Britain and the United States who did not intend to settle permanently in Australia, saying:

In 1999, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, dismissed the Eureka Stockade as a &quot;protest without consequence&quot;. Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson made the Eureka Flag a federal election campaign issue in 2004 saying &quot;I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade ... trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn&#x27;t enjoy&quot;. In the opening address of the Eureka 150 Democracy Conference in 2004, the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, said &quot;that Eureka was about the struggle for basic democratic rights. It was not about a riot—it was about rights&quot;.

==Commemoration==

===19th century===
Following an earlier meeting on 22 November 1855 held at the location of the stockade where calls for compensation were made, Carboni returned to the rebel burial ground for the first anniversary of the battle and remained for the day selling copies of his self-published memoirs. In 1856, for the second anniversary, veteran John Lynch gave a speech as several hundred people gathered at the Eureka lead before a march to the local cemetery to remember the fall of the Eureka Stockade. There was a collection to building railings around the Eureka burial ground.

On 22 March 1856, a diggers&#x27; memorial was erected in the Ballaarat Old Cemetery near marked graves. Sculpted in stone from the Barrabool Hills by James Leggatt in Geelong, it features a pillar with the names of the deceased miners and the inscription &quot;Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3 December 1854 in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government&quot;.

In 1857, the anniversary was much more low-key and was marked by &quot;some of the friends of those who fell to decorate their tombs with flowers ... the occasion will be passed over without any public demonstrations...&quot;. In 1858, at the appointed time, there was only a crowd of seven people at the cemetery, two of whom were journalists. The &quot;Ballarat Star&quot; report &quot;deplored the general lack of interest and neglected condition of the graves&quot;.

The soldiers were buried in the same cemetery as the rebels. In August 1872, the area surrounding the soldiers&#x27; graves was enclosed with a fence. A soldiers&#x27; memorial was constructed in 1879, an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from Waurn Ponds with the words &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Duty&quot; carved in its north and south faces, respectively.

In the 1860s and 1870s, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, with the anniversary rating the occasional reference in the &quot;Courier&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;. Eureka was kept alive at the campfires, pubs, and at memorial events in Ballarat. Key living figures such as Lalor and Humffray were still in the public eye.

The Eureka Stockade Monument located within the Eureka Stockade Gardens dates from 1884 and has been added to the Australian National Heritage List. A meeting was held at the partially completed monument on 3 December 1884. It appears there were no further gatherings at the Eureka Stockade Monument until the 50th-anniversary commemorations in 1904.

For at least ten years, beginning in 1884, the Old Colonists&#x27; Association held a service on or around the anniversary at Ballarat&#x27;s Eastern Oval in conjunction with its annual charity appeal. There was some reference made to the Eureka Stockade. It was sometimes preceded by a march from the Old Colonists&#x27; Hall in Lydiard Street.

Some of the earliest recorded examples of the Eureka Flag being used as a symbol of white nationalism and trade unionism are from the late 19th century. According to an oral tradition, the Eureka Flag was displayed at a seaman&#x27;s union protest against using cheap Asian labour on ships at Circular Quay in 1878. In August 1890, the Eureka Flag was draped from a platform in front of a crowd of 30,000 protesters assembled at the Yarra Bank in Melbourne in a show of solidarity with maritime workers. There was a similar flag flown prominently above the camp at Barcaldine during the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike.

In 1889, Melbourne businessmen employed renowned American cyclorama artist Thaddeus Welch, who teamed up with local artist Izett Watson to paint a canvas of the Eureka Stockade, wrapped around a wooden structure. When it opened in Melbourne, the exhibition was an instant hit. &quot;The Age&quot; reported in 1891 that &quot;it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what it might have been like at Eureka&quot;. &quot;The Australasian&quot; stated, &quot;that many persons familiar with the incidents depicted, were able to testify to the fidelity of the painted scene&quot;. The people of Melbourne flocked to the cyclorama, paid up and had their picture taken before it. Eventually, it was dismantled and disappeared from sight.

===20th century===

For the 50th anniversary in 1904, around sixty veterans gathered for a reunion at the Eureka Stockade memorial with large crowds in attendance. According to one report, there was a procession and &quot;much cheering and enthusiasm along the line of route, and the old pioneers received a very hearty greeting&quot;. The crowd heard from several speakers, including Ballarat-born Richard Crouch MP, who &quot;was not at all satisfied that the necessity for revolt had at all ended; in fact, he rather advocated a revolt against conventionalism and political cant&quot;.

In 1954, a committee of Ballarat locals was formed to coordinate events to mark the centenary of the Eureka Stockade. Historian Geoffrey Blainey, who was in Ballarat, recalls attending one function and finding that no one apart from a small group of communists was there. There was an oration at the Peter Lalor statue, a procession, a pageant at Sovereign Hill, a concert and dance, a dawn service, and a pilgrimage to the Eureka graves. The procession was headed by mounted police and servicemen from the Royal Australian Airforce base at Ballarat dressed in 1850s soldiers&#x27; uniforms. There were centenary commemoration events around Australia held under the auspices of the Communist Party of Australia, which in the 1940s named their youth organisation the Eureka Youth League. Catholic Church affiliates also endorsed a Eureka centenary supplement with commemorative events.

Ballarat&#x27;s best-known tourist destination, Sovereign Hill, was opened in November 1970 as an open-air museum set in the gold rush period. Since 1992, in commemoration of the Eureka Stockade, Sovereign Hill has featured a 90-minute son et lumière &quot;Blood Under the Southern Cross&quot;, a sound and light show attraction played under the night skies. It was revised and expanded in 2003. The Eureka Flag was temporarily on display at Sovereign Hill during 1987, while renovation work was being carried out at the Art Gallery of Ballarat.

In 1973, Gough Whitlam gave a speech, to mark the largest and most celebrated fragments of the Eureka Flag donated by the descendants of John King going on permanent display at the Art Gallery of Ballarat. He predicted that: &quot;an event like Eureka, with all its associations, with all its potent symbolism, will acquire an aura of excitement and romance, and stir the imagination of the Australian people&quot;.

A purpose-built interpretation centre was erected at the cost of $4 million in March 1998 in the suburb of Eureka near the Eureka Stockade memorial. Designed to be a new landmark for Ballarat, it was known as the Eureka Stockade Centre and then the Eureka Centre. The building originally featured an enormous sail emblazoned with the Eureka Flag. Before its development there was considerable debate over whether a replica or reconstruction of wooden structures was appropriate. It was eventually decided against, and this is seen by many as a reason for the apparent failure of the centre to draw significant tourist numbers. Due primarily to falling visitor numbers the &quot;controversial&quot; Eureka Centre was redeveloped between 2009 and 2011.

A life-size bronze sculpture of the Pikeman&#x27;s dog was unveiled in the courtyard of the interpretative centre at Eureka Stockade Memorial Park on 5 December 1999 in a ceremony that was attended by the Victorian premier Steve Bracks, former prime minister Gough Whitlam, and the Irish ambassador Richard O&#x27;Brien.

In 2013 it was relaunched as the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka with the aid of a further $5 million in funding from both the Australian and Victorian governments and $1.1 million from the City of Ballarat. The centrepiece of MADE&#x27;s collection was the &quot;King&quot; fragments of the Eureka Flag made available on loan from the Art Gallery of Ballarat, that represent 69.01% of the original specimen. In 2018, the City of Ballarat council resolved to assume responsibility for managing the facility. MADE was closed and since being reopened has been called the Eureka Centre Ballarat.

===21st century===
In 2004, the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade was commemorated. In November, the Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks announced that the Ballarat V/Line rail service would be renamed the &quot;Eureka Line&quot; to mark the 150th anniversary, taking effect from late 2005 at the same time as the renaming of Spencer Street railway station to Southern Cross. The proposal was criticised by community groups including the Public Transport Users Association.

Renaming of the line did not go ahead. The Spencer Street Station redesignation was announced in December 2005. Bracks stated that the change would resonate with Victorians because the Southern Cross &quot;stands for democracy and freedom because it flew over the Eureka Stockade&quot;.

An Australian postage stamp featuring the Eureka Flag was released along with a set of commemorative coins. A ceremony in Ballarat known as the lantern walk was held at dawn. Prime Minister John Howard did not attend any commemorative events and refused to allow the Eureka Flag to fly over Parliament House.

The Eureka Tower in Melbourne, completed in 2006, is named in honour of the rebellion and features symbolic aspects such as blue glass and white stripes in reference to both the Eureka Flag and a surveyor&#x27;s measuring staff and a crown of gold glass with a red stripe to represent the blood spilled on the goldfields.

In 2014, to mark the 160th anniversary of the Eureka Rebellion, the Australian Flag Society released a commemorative folk cartoon entitled &quot;Fall Back with the Eureka Jack&quot; that was inspired by the Eureka Jack mystery.

In June 2022, the City of Ballarat, in conjunction with Eureka Australia, unveiled a new Pathway of Remembrance at the Eureka Stockade Memorial Park commemorating the &quot;35 men who lost their lives during the Eureka Stockade in 1854&quot;.

==Popular culture==
The Eureka Rebellion has been the inspiration for numerous novels, poems, films, songs, plays and artworks. Much of the Eureka folklore relies heavily on Raffaello Carboni&#x27;s 1855 book, &quot;The Eureka Stockade&quot;, which was the first and only comprehensive eyewitness account of the rebellion. Henry Lawson wrote a number of poems about Eureka, as have many novelists. There have been four motion pictures based on the uprising at Ballarat. The first was &quot;Eureka Stockade&quot;, a 1907 silent film, the second feature film produced in Australia.

There have been a number of plays and songs about the rebellion. The folk song &quot;German Teddy&quot; concerns Edward Thonen, one of the rebels who dies defending the Eureka Stockade.

<doc id="9835" wikidata="Q403033" url="?curid=9835" title="Escape from New York">
<text>Escape from New York is a 1981 American independent science fiction action film co-written, co-scored and directed by John Carpenter, and starring Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau and Harry Dean Stanton.

The film, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden United States, which has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country&#x27;s sole maximum security prison. Air Force One is hijacked by anti-government insurgents who deliberately crash it into the walled borough. Former Special Forces and current federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the President of the United States, after which, if successful, he will be pardoned.

Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the Watergate scandal. After the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri, on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who played Michael Myers in &quot;Halloween&quot;.

Released in the United States on July 10, 1981, the film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $50 million at the box office. The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell.

==Plot==
In 1988, amidst war between the United States and an alliance of China and the Soviet Union, Manhattan has been converted into a maximum security prison to address a 400% increase in crime. The island is walled off from the outside world and under heavy police surveillance.

In 1997, while flying President John Harker to a peace summit in Hartford, Air Force One is hijacked by a terrorist. The President is handcuffed with a briefcase and put into an escape pod that drops into Manhattan as the aircraft crashes.

Police are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, a subordinate of the Duke of New York (a powerful crime boss), warns the President has been captured and will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Meanwhile, former Special Forces soldier Snake Plissken is about to be imprisoned in Manhattan after being convicted of robbing the Federal Reserve. Snake accepts a deal from Police Commissioner Bob Hauk in which he will be pardoned in exchange for rescuing the President in time for the summit. To ensure his cooperation, Hauk has Snake injected with micro-explosives that will sever his carotid arteries in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.

Snake uses a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, then follows the signal of the President&#x27;s tracking device to a vaudeville theater, only to find the tracker on the arm of a deluded vagrant. Snake is convinced the President is dead, but Hauk warns Snake he will be killed if he returns without the President. Inspecting the escape pod, Snake is ambushed by dozens of starving &quot;crazies&quot; and his radio is destroyed. He is rescued by &quot;Cabbie&quot;, a jovial character who drives a taxi.

Cabbie takes Snake to Harold &quot;Brain&quot; Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake&#x27;s. An engineer, Brain has established a small gasoline refinery fueling the city&#x27;s remaining cars; he tells Snake the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the 69th Street Bridge, using the President as a human shield. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke&#x27;s hideout at Grand Central Terminal. Snake finds the President but gets shot in the leg with a crossbow bolt and is overpowered by the Duke&#x27;s men.

While Snake is forced to fight against Duke&#x27;s champion Slag in a deathmatch, Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag and finds the trio trying to escape in the glider. Inmates drop the glider off the roof, forcing the group back down to street level where they are confronted by the Duke and his followers. Cabbie arrives and offers to take them across the bridge. Cabbie reveals he bartered with Romero for a cassette tape that contains information about nuclear fusion, intended to be an international peace offering. The President demands the cassette, but Snake retains it.

The Duke gives chase, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake, but they hit a mine and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain accidentally stumbles onto another mine. A distraught Maggie sacrifices herself to slow down the Duke. Snake and the President reach the containment wall and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards before Snake subdues him. As Snake is being lifted up by the rope, the Duke attempts to shoot him, but the President takes up a dead guard&#x27;s rifle and kills the Duke. Snake is hoisted to safety and Hauk&#x27;s doctor removes the explosives in his neck with seconds to spare.

As the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake for saving him but offers only half-hearted regret for the deaths of his colleagues; Snake walks away in disgust. Hauk offers Snake a job as his deputy but he keeps walking. The President&#x27;s speech commences and he plays the cassette. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie&#x27;s favorite song, &quot;Bandstand Boogie&quot;. As Snake walks away a free man, he pulls the real cassette from his pocket and destroys it.

==Cast==

In addition, frequent Carpenter collaborators Nancy Stephens appeared as the &quot;Hijacker&quot; and Buck Flower appeared as the &quot;Drunk with the president&#x27;s tracker&quot;, respectively, while then-active professional wrestler 
Ox Baker played &quot;Slag&quot;. The narrator was voiced by Kathleen Blanchard. Actor Joe Unger filmed scenes as Snake&#x27;s partner-in-crime Bill Taylor, but they were cut from the final film.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Carpenter originally wrote the screenplay for &quot;Escape from New York&quot; in 1976, in the aftermath of Nixon&#x27;s Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, &quot;The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the president.&quot; He wrote the screenplay, but no studio wanted to make it because, according to Carpenter, &quot;[i]t was too violent, too scary, [and] too weird&quot;. He had been inspired by the film &quot;Death Wish&quot;, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film&#x27;s philosophy, but liked how it conveyed &quot;the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science-fiction film along these lines&quot;.

International Film Investors agreed to provide 50% of the budget, and Goldcrest Films signed a co-financing deal with them. They ended up providing £720,000 of the budget and making a profit of £672,000 from their investment after earning £1,392,000.

===Casting===
AVCO Embassy Pictures, the film&#x27;s financial backer, preferred Charles Bronson, Tommy Lee Jones or Chuck Norris to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter&#x27;s choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the &quot;lightweight&quot; screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the film with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as &quot;a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood&#x27;s vocal-ness.&quot; Russell suggested that the character should wear an eyepatch. All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is &quot;the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.&quot; Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.

===Pre-production===
Carpenter had just made &quot;Dark Star&quot;, but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making &quot;Escape&quot; later. After the success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, Avco-Embassy signed producer Debra Hill and him to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was &quot;The Fog&quot;. Initially, the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot;, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, &quot;This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn&#x27;t have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.&quot; He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at University of Southern California, who played &quot;The Shape&quot; in &quot;Halloween&quot;. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film&#x27;s ending.

The film&#x27;s setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoestring budget. The film&#x27;s production designer Joe Alves and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea &quot;because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.&quot; They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), &quot;on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,&quot; producer Debra Hill remembers.

Bernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois, because it was filled with old buildings &quot;that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality&quot; that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, &quot;block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.&quot; Also, Alves found an old bridge to serve as the &quot;69th St. Bridge&quot;. The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, &quot;so that they wouldn&#x27;t have any liability,&quot; Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated, as well as the building that would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.

===Filming===
Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. &quot;We&#x27;d finish shooting at about 6 am and I&#x27;d just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I&#x27;d wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.&quot; The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, &quot;That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.&quot; In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system (the latter scenes were cut from the final film). In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. &quot;We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn&#x27;t easy to get that initial permission. They&#x27;d had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble&quot;.
Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. &quot;One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England&quot;. Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special-effects artist with Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter initially wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional wireframe animation.

====LaserDisc releases====
&quot;Escape from New York&quot; was released on LaserDisc 10 times between 1983 and 1998. A 1994 Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell that is still included on more recent DVD releases of the film.

====DVD releases====
&quot;Escape from New York&quot; was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector&#x27;s Edition, a two-disc set featuring a high definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot;, and the 10-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.

MGM&#x27;s special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had gone missing. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the Hutchinson, Kansas, salt-mine film depository. The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: &quot;After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn&#x27;t really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn&#x27;t necessary to show what sent him there.&quot; The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable.

====Blu-ray release====
On August 3, 2010, MGM Home Entertainment released &quot;Escape From New York&quot; as a bare-bones Blu-ray. Scream Factory, in association with Shout! Factory, released the film on a special edition Blu-ray on April 21, 2015.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Escape from New York&quot; opened in New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981. The film grossed $26 million in American theaters in summer 1981. Worldwide it grossed over $50 million.

===Critical response===
The film received generally positive reviews. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine wrote of Carpenter: &quot;[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility – which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however&quot;. In &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;John Carpenter is offering this summer&#x27;s moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It&#x27;s a trip worth taking&quot;. Vincent Canby, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;[The film] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It&#x27;s a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season&quot;. On the other hand, in his negative review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, critic Dave Kehr, wrote &quot;it fails to satisfy – it gives us too little of too much&quot;.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Escape from New York&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #10 and commented that &quot;It is solid summer entertainment of unusually high caliber. By not pretending to be more than it is, but by also not settling for any &quot;less&quot; than it could be, &quot;Escape&quot; becomes an exciting, fast-moving drama, the likes of which we haven&#x27;t seen in years.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 72 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, Escape from New York is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness.&quot; 

===Legacy===
Cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his 1984 science fiction novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. &quot;I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake &#x27;You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn&#x27;t you?&#x27; It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot&quot;. Popular video game director Hideo Kojima copied aspects of the film for his &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. Solid Snake heavily resembles the character Snake Plissken. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, Snake even uses the alias &quot;Pliskin&quot; to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked Snake Plissken number 29 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll.

==Other media==
===Sequels===

A sequel, &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also a producer and co-writer.

A remake for &quot;Escape from New York&quot; began development in 2007, when New Line Cinema won the rights to remake in a bidding war. Gerard Butler was attached to play Snake Plissken, Neal H. Moritz would produce through his Original Film company, and Ken Nolan would be in charge of the screenplay. Len Wiseman was announced to direct, but was later replaced by Brett Ratner, who also stepped down from the project. In April 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Breck Eisner was being looked at to direct a remake of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, with David Kajganich and Allan Loeb providing revisions to the script. It was later announced in 2011 that New Line had dropped the remake completely. In January 2015, 20th Century Fox purchased the remake rights, with The Picture Company producing. In March 2017, it was announced that Robert Rodriguez would direct a remake of the film with Carpenter producing it. In February 2019, it was reported that Leigh Whannell would be writing the script after &quot;Luther&quot; creator Neil Cross completed a recent iteration of the project. Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt, was considered to portray Snake Plissken, but he expressed no interest in playing the role, considering it &quot;career suicide.&quot; In November 2022, it was revealed that Radio Silence would be directing the film, with Andrew Rona, Alex Heineman, and Radio Silence producing, and Carpenter serving as an executive producer. They are currently searching for a writer. The next month, the film was confirmed to be a sequel, rather than a remake.

===Novelization===
In 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel includes significant scenes that were cut from the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake&#x27;s incarceration. The novel provides background on the relationship between Snake and Hauk—presenting the characters as disillusioned war veterans, and deepening the relationship that was only hinted in the film. The novel also explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk&#x27;s quest to find his crazed son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel gives greater detail on the world in which these characters live, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. It explains that the West Coast is a no-man&#x27;s land, and the nation&#x27;s population is gradually being driven insane by nerve gas as a result of World War III. The novel also clarifies that the president&#x27;s plan for the cassette tape is not benevolent. Rather than presenting to the world a new energy source in the form of nuclear fusion (as claimed in the film), the tape actually reveals the successful development of a &quot;fallout-free thermonuclear weapon, which would grant the US supremacy in the global conflict.

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics released the one-shot &quot;The Adventures of Snake Plissken&quot; in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; Snake has robbed Atlanta&#x27;s Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal&#x27;s every move. The robot&#x27;s first test subject is America&#x27;s public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, &quot;Why?&quot; Snake just walks off, answering, &quot;I don&#x27;t need the competition&quot;.

In 2003, CrossGen and Hurricane Entertainment published &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot;, a four-part comic book miniseries. The story takes place a day or so after the events of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Escape from New York&quot; shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double-crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell&#x27;s 1992 comedy, &quot;Captain Ron&quot;). When Ron denies Snake&#x27;s request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer&#x27;s yacht, using Ron&#x27;s boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job. The series was written by William O&#x27;Neill and penciled by Tone Rodriguez with Jan Utstein as editor.

In 2014, BOOM! Studios began publishing an &quot;Escape from New York&quot; comic book by writer, Christopher Sebela. The first issue of the series was released on December 3, 2014, and the story picks up moments after the end of the film.

BOOM! released a crossover comics miniseries between Snake and Jack Burton titled &quot;Big Trouble in Little China/Escape from New York&quot; in October 2016.

===Board games===
An &quot;Escape from New York&quot; board game was released in 1981 by TSR, Inc. Another board game was crowd-funded in 2022.

===Cancelled anime===
In 2003, Carpenter was planning an anime spin-off of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, with &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;″s Mitsuru Hongo slated to direct.

===Cancelled video game===
A video game adaptation was in development in 2004–2005.

<doc id="9837" wikidata="Q151313" url="?curid=9837" title="Ethylene">
<text>Ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is a hydrocarbon which has the formula or . It is a colourless, flammable gas with a faint &quot;sweet and musky&quot; odour when pure. It is the simplest alkene (a hydrocarbon with carbon–carbon double bonds). 

Ethylene is widely used in the chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 150 million tonnes in 2016) exceeds that of any other organic compound. Much of this production goes toward creating polythene, which is a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. Production emits greenhouse gases, including methane from feedstock production and carbon dioxide from any non-sustainable energy used.

Ethylene is also an important natural plant hormone and is used in agriculture to induce ripening of fruits. The hydrate of ethylene is ethanol.

==Structure and properties==

This hydrocarbon has four hydrogen atoms bound to a pair of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are coplanar. The H-C-H angle is 117.4°, close to the 120° for ideal sp² hybridized carbon. The molecule is also relatively weak: rotation about the C-C bond is a very low energy process that requires breaking the π-bond by supplying heat at 50 °C.

The π-bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high electron density, thus it is susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind transiently to the ethylene using both the π and π* orbitals.

Being a simple molecule, ethylene is spectroscopically simple. Its UV-vis spectrum is still used as a test of theoretical methods.

==Uses==

Major industrial reactions of ethylene include in order of scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene. Most of the reactions with ethylene are electrophilic addition.


===Polymerization===

Polyethylene production uses more than half of the world&#x27;s ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called &quot;polyethene&quot; and &quot;polythene&quot;, is the world&#x27;s most widely used plastic. It is primarily used to make films in packaging, carrier bags and trash liners. Linear alpha-olefins, produced by oligomerization (formation of short-chain molecules) are used as precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic lubricants, additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.

===Oxidation===
Ethylene is oxidized to produce ethylene oxide, a key raw material in the production of surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce ethylene glycol, widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, glycol ethers, and polyethylene terephthalate.
Ethylene oxidation in the presence of a palladium catalyst can form acetaldehyde. This conversion remains a major industrial process (10M kg/y). The process proceeds via the initial complexation of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.

===Halogenation and hydrohalogenation===
Major intermediates from the halogenation and hydrohalogenation of ethylene include ethylene dichloride, ethyl chloride, and ethylene dibromide. The addition of chlorine entails &quot;oxychlorination&quot;, i.e. chlorine itself is not used. Some products derived from this group are polyvinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methyl chloroform, polyvinylidene chloride and copolymers, and ethyl bromide.

===Alkylation===
Major chemical intermediates from the alkylation with ethylene is ethylbenzene, precursor to styrene. Styrene is used principally in polystyrene for packaging and insulation, as well as in styrene-butadiene rubber for tires and footwear. On a smaller scale, ethyltoluene, ethylanilines, 1,4-hexadiene, and aluminium alkyls. Products of these intermediates include polystyrene, unsaturated polyesters and ethylene-propylene terpolymers.

===Oxo reaction===
The hydroformylation (oxo reaction) of ethylene results in propionaldehyde, a precursor to propionic acid and n-propyl alcohol.

===Hydration===
Ethylene has long represented the major nonfermentative precursor to ethanol. The original method entailed its conversion to diethyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis. The main method practiced since the mid-1990s is the direct hydration of ethylene catalyzed by solid acid catalysts:
:C2H4 + H2O → CH3CH2OH

===Dimerization to butenes===
Ethylene is dimerized by hydrovinylation to give &quot;n&quot;-butenes using processes licensed by Lummus or IFP. The Lummus process produces mixed &quot;n&quot;-butenes (primarily 2-butenes) while the IFP process produces 1-butene. 1-Butene is used as a comonomer in the production of certain kinds of polyethylene.

===Fruit and flowering===

Ethylene is a hormone that affects the ripening and flowering of many plants. It is widely used to control freshness in horticulture and fruits. The scrubbing of naturally occurring ethylene delays ripening. Adsorption of ethylene by nets coated in titanium dioxide gel has also been shown to be effective.

===Niche uses===
An example of a niche use is as an anesthetic agent (in an 85% ethylene/15% oxygen ratio). It is also used as a refrigerant gas for low temperature applications under the name R-1150.

==Production==
Global ethylene production was 107 million tonnes in 2005, 109 million tonnes in 2006, 138 million tonnes in 2010, and 141 million tonnes in 2011. By 2013, ethylene was produced by at least 117 companies in 32 countries. To meet the ever-increasing demand for ethylene, sharp increases in production facilities are added globally, particularly in the Mideast and in China. Production emits greenhouse gas, namely significant amounts of carbon dioxide.

===Industrial process===
Ethylene is produced by several methods in the petrochemical industry. A primary method is steam cracking (SC) where hydrocarbons and steam are heated to 750–950 °C. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. When ethane is the feedstock, ethylene is the product. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking naphtha, gasoil and condensates with the coproduction of propylene, C4 olefins and aromatics (pyrolysis gasoline). Other procedures employed for the production of ethylene include Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol-to-olefins (MTO).

===Laboratory synthesis===
Although of great value industrially, ethylene is rarely synthesized in the laboratory and is ordinarily purchased. It can be produced via dehydration of ethanol with sulfuric acid or in the gas phase with aluminium oxide or activated alumina.

===Biosynthesis===
Ethylene is produced from methionine in nature. The immediate precursor is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.

==Ligand==

Ethylene is a fundamental ligand in transition metal alkene complexes. One of the first organometallic compounds, Zeise&#x27;s salt is a complex of ethylene. Useful reagents containing ethylene include Pt(PPh3)2(C2H4) and Rh2Cl2(C2H4)4. The Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of ethylene is conducted on an industrial scale to provide propionaldehyde.

==History==
Some geologists and scholars believe that the famous Greek Oracle at Delphi (the Pythia) went into her trance-like state as an effect of ethylene rising from ground faults.

Ethylene appears to have been discovered by Johann Joachim Becher, who obtained it by heating ethanol with sulfuric acid; he mentioned the gas in his &quot;Physica Subterranea&quot; (1669). Joseph Priestley also mentions the gas in his &quot;Experiments and observations relating to the various branches of natural philosophy: with a continuation of the observations on air&quot; (1779), where he reports that Jan Ingenhousz saw ethylene synthesized in the same way by a Mr. Enée in Amsterdam in 1777 and that Ingenhousz subsequently produced the gas himself. The properties of ethylene were studied in 1795 by four Dutch chemists, Johann Rudolph Deimann, Adrien Paets van Troostwyck, Anthoni Lauwerenburgh and Nicolas Bondt, who found that it differed from hydrogen gas and that it contained both carbon and hydrogen. This group also discovered that ethylene could be combined with chlorine to produce the &quot;Dutch oil&quot;, 1,2-dichloroethane; this discovery gave ethylene the name used for it at that time, &quot;olefiant gas&quot; (oil-making gas.) The term olefiant gas is in turn the etymological origin of the modern word &quot;olefin&quot;, the class of hydrocarbons in which ethylene is the first member.

In the mid-19th century, the suffix &quot;-ene&quot; (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;) was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, &quot;ethylene&quot; () was the &quot;daughter of ethyl&quot; (). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.

In 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent alkane. In this system, ethylene became &quot;ethene&quot;. Hofmann&#x27;s system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the IUPAC nomenclature. However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.

Following experimentation by Luckhardt, Crocker, and Carter at the University of Chicago, ethylene was used as an anesthetic. It remained in use through the 1940s, even while chloroform was being phased out. Its pungent odor and its explosive nature limit its use today.

===Nomenclature===
The 1979 IUPAC nomenclature rules made an exception for retaining the non-systematic name &quot;ethylene&quot;; however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rules, and it remains unchanged in the newest 2013 recommendations, so the IUPAC name is now &quot;ethene&quot;. In the IUPAC system, the name &quot;ethylene&quot; is reserved for the divalent group -CH2CH2-. Hence, names like &quot;ethylene oxide&quot; and &quot;ethylene dibromide&quot; are permitted, but the use of the name &quot;ethylene&quot; for the two-carbon alkene is not. Nevertheless, use of the name &quot;ethylene&quot; for H2C=CH2 (and propylene for H2C=CHCH3) is still prevalent among chemists in North America.

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
&quot;A key factor affecting petrochemicals life-cycle emissions is the methane intensity of feedstocks, especially in the production segment.&quot; Emissions from cracking of naptha and natural gas (common in the US as gas is cheap there) depend a lot on the source of energy (for example gas burnt to provide high temperatures) but that from naptha is certainly more per kg of feedstock. Both steam cracking and production from natural gas via ethane are estimated to emit 1.8 to 2kg of CO2 per kg ethylene produced, totalling over 260 million tonnes a year. This is more than all other manufactured chemicals except cement and ammonia. According to a 2022 report using renewable or nuclear energy could cut emissions by almost half.

==Safety==
Like all hydrocarbons, ethylene is a combustible asphyxiant. It is listed as an IARC group 3 agent, since there is no current evidence that it causes cancer in humans.

<doc id="9838" wikidata="Q732089" url="?curid=9838" title="Eiffel (programming language)">
<text>Eiffel is an object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer (an object-orientation proponent and author of &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot;) and Eiffel Software. Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development. The first version was released in 1986. In 2005, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released a technical standard for Eiffel.

The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command–query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open–closed principle, and option–operand separation.

Many concepts initially introduced by Eiffel were later added into Java, C#, and other languages. New language design ideas, particularly through the Ecma/ISO standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language.

==Characteristics==
The key characteristics of the Eiffel language include:

* An object-oriented program structure in which a class serves as the basic unit of decomposition.
* Design by contract tightly integrated with other language constructs.
* Automatic memory management, typically implemented by garbage collection.
* Inheritance, including multiple inheritance, , redefinition, &quot;select&quot;, non-conforming inheritance, and other mechanisms intended to make inheritance safe.
* Constrained and unconstrained generic programming
* A uniform type system handling both value and reference semantics in which all types, including basic types such as INTEGER, are class-based.
* Static typing
* Void safety, or static protection against calls on null references, through the attached-types mechanism.
* Agents, or objects that wrap computations, closely connected with closures and lambda calculus.
* &quot;Once&quot; routines, or routines evaluated only once, for object sharing and decentralized initialization.
* Keyword-based syntax in the ALGOL/Pascal tradition but separator-free, insofar as semicolons are optional, with operator syntax available for routines.
* Case insensitivity
* Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming (SCOOP) facilitates creation of multiple, concurrently active execution vehicles at a level of abstraction above the specific details of these vehicles (e.g. multiple threads without specific mutex management).

==Design goals==
Eiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.

Eiffel shuns coding tricks or techniques intended as program optimization hints to a compiler. The goals are to make the code more readable, and to facilitate concentrating on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. Eiffel&#x27;s simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. Compilers for computer programs written in Eiffel provide extensive optimizing techniques, such as automatic inline expansion (inlining), that eliminate part of the optimizing burden.

===Background===
Eiffel was originally developed by Eiffel Software, a company founded by Bertrand Meyer. &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot; contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to Eiffel&#x27;s design.

The design goal behind the Eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. Eiffel supports multiple inheritance, genericity, polymorphism, encapsulation, type-safe conversions, and parameter covariance. Eiffel&#x27;s most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract (DbC), in which assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.

Eiffel&#x27;s design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other programming paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. Eiffel formally supports abstract data types. Under Eiffel&#x27;s design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the &quot;Abstract Data Type&quot;.

===Implementations and environments===
EiffelStudio is an integrated development environment available under either an open source or a commercial license. It offers an object-oriented environment for software engineering. EiffelEnvision is a plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that allows users to edit, compile, and debug Eiffel projects from within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Five other open source implementations are available: &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp; Gobo Eiffel; SmartEiffel, the GNU implementation, based on an older version of the language; LibertyEiffel, based on the SmartEiffel compiler; and Visual Eiffel.

Several other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in Eiffel. Sather, for example, was originally based on Eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. The interactive-teaching language Blue, forerunner of BlueJ, is also Eiffel-based. The Apple Media Tool includes an Eiffel-based Apple Media Language.

===Specifications and standards===
The Eiffel language definition is an international standard of the ISO. The standard was developed by ECMA International, which first approved the standard on 21 June 2005 as Standard ECMA-367, Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language. In June 2006, ECMA and ISO adopted the second version. In November 2006, ISO first published that version. The standard can be found and used free of charge on the ECMA site. The ISO version is identical in all respects except formatting.

Eiffel Software, &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp and Eiffel-library-developer Gobo have committed to implementing the standard; Eiffel Software&#x27;s EiffelStudio 6.1 and &quot;The Eiffel Compiler&quot; tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms—in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. The SmartEiffel team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of Eiffel. Object Tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its Eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. LibertyEiffel implements a dialect somewhere in between the SmartEiffel language and the standard.

The standard cites the following, predecessor Eiffel-language specifications:

* Bertrand Meyer: &quot;Eiffel: The Language&quot;, Prentice Hall, second printing, 1992 (first printing: 1991)
* Bertrand Meyer: &quot;Standard Eiffel&quot; (revision of preceding entry), ongoing, 1997–present, at Bertrand Meyer&#x27;s ETL3 page, and
* Bertrand Meyer: &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot;, Prentice Hall: first edition, 1988; second edition, 1997.
* Bertrand Meyer: &quot;Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts&quot;, Springer-Verlag, 2009 lxiv + 876 pages Full-color printing, numerous color photographs

The current version of the standard from June 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions). The ECMA committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.

==Syntax and semantics==

===Overall structure===
An Eiffel &quot;system&quot; or &quot;program&quot; is a collection of &quot;classes&quot;. Above the level of classes, Eiffel defines &quot;cluster&quot;, which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of &quot;subclusters&quot; (nested clusters). Clusters are not a syntactic language construct, but rather a standard organizational convention. Typically an Eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. In this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. For example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, codice_1 might be the name of a file that defines a class called X.

A class contains &quot;features&quot;, which are similar to &quot;routines&quot;, &quot;members&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot; or &quot;methods&quot; in other object-oriented programming languages. A class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a &quot;notes&quot; section for documentation and metadata. Eiffel&#x27;s standard data types, such as codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, are all themselves classes.

Every system must have a class designated as &quot;root&quot;, with one of its creation procedures designated as &quot;root procedure&quot;. Executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. Generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.

Eiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. Eiffel&#x27;s control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.

====Scoping====
Unlike many object-oriented languages, but like Smalltalk, Eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of information hiding or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. To put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all Eiffel attributes are &quot;protected&quot;, and &quot;setters&quot; are needed for client objects to modify values. An upshot of this is that &quot;setters&quot; can and normally do, implement the invariants for which Eiffel provides syntax.

While Eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an &quot;assigner command&quot;, such as:
 some_attribute: SOME_TYPE assign set_some_attribute
 set_some_attribute (v: VALUE_TYPE)
 -- Set value of some_attribute to `v&#x27;.
 do
 some_attribute := v
 end
While a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the Information Hiding Principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a &quot;setter&quot; being used. In practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like codice_5 as in the example code above.

Unlike other languages, having notions of &quot;public&quot;, &quot;protected&quot;, &quot;private&quot; and so on, Eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. Feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. For example, (below), the &quot;{NONE}&quot; is similar to &quot;protected&quot; in other languages. Scope applied this way to a &quot;feature set&quot; (e.g. everything below the &#x27;feature&#x27; keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the &quot;export&quot; keyword.
feature {NONE} -- Initialization
 default_create
 -- Initialize a new `zero&#x27; decimal instance.
 do
 make_zero
 end
Alternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {ANY} and is similar to the &quot;public&quot; scoping of other languages.
feature -- Constants
Finally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the Eiffel project universe, such as:
feature {DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER} -- Access
Here, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. ).

====&quot;Hello, world!&quot;====
A programming language&#x27;s look and feel is often conveyed using a &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program. Such a program written in Eiffel might be:
class
 HELLO_WORLD
create
 make
feature
 make
 do
 print (&quot;Hello, world!%N&quot;)
 end
end 
This program contains the class codice_6. The constructor (create routine) for the class, named codice_7, invokes the codice_8 system library routine to write a codice_9 codice_10 message to the output.

===Design by contract===

The concept of Design by Contract is central to Eiffel. The contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). Class Invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). Moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.

The Eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. EiffelStudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the &quot;Workbench mode.&quot; When an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ECF file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. Thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. Moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the Auto-Test feature found in EiffelStudio.

The Design by Contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:

* Routine precondition: The precondition may only be weakened by inheritance; any call that meets the requirements of the ancestor meets those of the descendant.
* Routine postcondition: The postcondition can only be strengthened by inheritance; any result guaranteed by the ancestor is still provided by the descendant.
* Class invariant: Conditions that must hold true after the object&#x27;s creation and after any call to an exported class routine. Because the invariant is checked so often, it makes it simultaneously the most expensive and most powerful form of condition or contract.

In addition, the language supports a &quot;check instruction&quot; (a kind of &quot;assert&quot;), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).

===Void-safe capability===
Void-safe ability, like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. Void-safe software is protected from runtime errors caused by calls to void references, and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. The analogy to static typing is a useful one. Void-safe ability can be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void safety is integrated into the type system.

The guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). The void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:
 some_attribute: detachable SOME_TYPE
 use_some_attribute
 -- Set value of some_attribute to `v&#x27;.
 do
 if attached some_attribute as l_attribute then
 do_something (l_attribute)
 end
 end
 do_something (a_value: SOME_TYPE)
 -- Do something with `a_value&#x27;.
 do
 ... doing something with `a_value&#x27; ...
 end
The code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether codice_5 will be attached or detached at the point it is used. Notably, the codice_12 keyword allows for an &quot;attachment local&quot; (e.g. codice_13), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. Thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. codice_13) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void safe).

===Features: commands and queries===
The primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or &quot;instances&quot;, a feature is an operation on these objects. There are two kinds of features: queries and commands. A query provides information about an instance. A command modifies an instance.

The command-query distinction is important to the Eiffel method. In particular:

* Uniform-Access Principle: from the point of view of a software client making a call to a class feature, whether a query is an attribute (field value) or a function (computed value) should not make any difference. For example, codice_15 could be an attribute accessed on the object codice_16, or it could be computed by a function that divides distance by time. The notation is the same in both cases, so that it is easy to change the class&#x27;s implementation without affecting client software.
* Command-Query Separation Principle: Queries must not modify the instance. This is not a language rule but a methodological principle. So in good Eiffel style, one does not find &quot;get&quot; functions that change something and return a result; instead there are commands (procedures) to change objects, and queries to obtain information about the object, resulting from preceding changes.

===Overloading===
Eiffel does not allow argument overloading. Each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. One name, within one class, means one thing. This design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. It also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes Eiffel&#x27;s multiple inheritance mechanism possible.

Names can, of course, be reused in different classes. For example, the feature (along with its infix alias ) is defined in several classes: , , , etc.

===Genericity===
A generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. LIST [PHONE], a list of phone numbers; ACCOUNT [G-&gt;ACCOUNT_TYPE], allowing for ACCOUNT [SAVINGS] and ACCOUNT [CHECKING], etc.). Classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. Generic parameters appear in square brackets:
class LIST [G] ...
G is known as a &quot;formal generic parameter&quot;. (Eiffel reserves &quot;argument&quot; for routines, and uses &quot;parameter&quot; only for generic classes.) With such a declaration G represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type G, and a routine can take an argument of that type:
item: G do ... end
put (x: G) do ... end
The codice_17 and codice_18 are &quot;generic derivations&quot; of this class. Permitted combinations (with codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22) are:
n := il.item
wl.put (w)
codice_2 and codice_24 are the &quot;actual generic parameters&quot; in these generic derivations.

It is also possible to have &#x27;constrained&#x27; formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the &quot;constraint&quot;. For example, in
 class HASH_TABLE [G, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE]
a derivation codice_25 is valid only if codice_3 inherits from codice_27 (as it indeed does in typical Eiffel libraries). Within the class, having codice_28 constrained by codice_27 means that for codice_30 it is possible to apply to codice_31 all the features of codice_27, as in codice_33.

===Inheritance basics===
To inherit from one or more others, a class will include an codice_34 clause at the beginning:
class C inherit
 A
 B

-- ... Rest of class declaration ...
The class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. This must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a codice_35 subclause of the inheritance clause, as in
class C inherit
 A
 redefine f, g, h end
 B
 redefine u, v end
See for a complete discussion of Eiffel inheritance.

===Deferred classes and features===
Classes may be defined with codice_36 rather than with codice_37 to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. Non-instantiatable classes are called abstract classes in some other object-oriented programming languages. In Eiffel parlance, only an &quot;effective&quot; class can be instantiated (it may be a descendant of a deferred class). A feature can also be deferred by using the codice_38 keyword in place of a codice_39 clause. If a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.

Deferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as Java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to Java&#x27;s lack of multiple inheritance (which Eiffel has).

===Renaming===
A class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. It may, however, change their names through codice_40 clauses. This is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.

===Tuples===
Tuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding &quot;setter&quot; procedure. A typical tuple type reads
 TUPLE [name: STRING; weight: REAL; date: DATE]
and could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. An instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as
 [&quot;Brigitte&quot;, 3.5, Last_night]
Components of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if codice_41 has been assigned the above tuple then codice_42 has value 3.5.

Thanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in
 t.weight := t.weight + 0.5
The tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as codice_43. (In some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ECMA standard.)

The precise specification of e.g. codice_44 is that it describes sequences of &quot;at least&quot; three elements, the first three being of types codice_45, codice_46, codice_47 respectively. As a result, codice_44 conforms to (may be assigned to) codice_49, to codice_50 and to codice_51 (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.

===Agents===
Eiffel&#x27;s &quot;agent&quot; mechanism wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be used for iteration, event-driven programming, and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize functional programming, allow a similar pattern using continuations, closures, or generators; Eiffel&#x27;s agents emphasize the language&#x27;s object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in Smalltalk and Ruby.

For example, to execute the codice_52 block for each element of codice_53, one would write:
 my_list.do_all (agent my_action)
To execute codice_52 only on elements satisfying codice_55, a limitation/filter can be added:
 my_list.do_if (agent my_action, agent my_condition)
In these examples, codice_52 and codice_55 are routines. Prefixing them with codice_58 yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. So if codice_59 represents that object (for example because codice_59 is the argument to codice_61), the instruction
 a.call ([x])
will call the original routine with the argument codice_31, as if we had directly called the original routine: codice_63. Arguments to codice_64 are passed as a tuple, here codice_65.

It is possible to keep some arguments to an agent open and make others closed. The open arguments are passed as arguments to codice_64: they are provided at the time of &quot;agent use&quot;. The closed arguments are provided at the time of agent &quot;definition&quot;. For example, if codice_67 has two arguments, the iteration
 my_list.do_all (agent action2 (?, y))
iterates codice_68 for successive values of codice_31, where the second argument remains set to codice_70. The question mark codice_71 indicates an open argument; codice_70 is a closed argument of the agent. Note that the basic syntax codice_73 is a shorthand for codice_74 with all arguments open. It is also possible to make the &quot;target&quot; of an agent open through the notation codice_75 where codice_76 is the type of the target.

The distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in lambda calculus. An agent expression such as codice_77 with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation &quot;curried&quot; on the closed operands.

The agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as codice_52, codice_55, codice_67), through inline agents as in
my_list.do_all (agent (s: STRING)
 require
 not_void: s /= Void
 do
 s.append_character (&#x27;,&#x27;)
 ensure
 appended: s.count = old s.count + 1
 end)
The inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. This avoids defining routines when all that&#x27;s needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. This is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:
 my_list.for_all (agent (x: INTEGER): BOOLEAN do Result := (x &gt; 0) end)
The current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with &quot;n&quot; arguments is passed to an agent expecting &quot;m&quot; arguments with &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;). This can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition codice_81 of codice_64. Several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by Ribet et al.

===Once routines===
A routine&#x27;s result can be cached using the codice_83 keyword in place of codice_39. Non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. A common pattern for &quot;once functions&quot; is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. The typical scheme is:
shared_object: SOME_TYPE
 once
 create Result.make (args)
 -- This creates the object and returns a reference to it through `Result&#x27;.
 end
The returned object—codice_85 in the example—can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.

Often &quot;once routines&quot; perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. Using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. &quot;Once routines&quot; are similar in purpose and effect to the singleton pattern in many programming languages, and to the used in Python.

By default, a &quot;once routine&quot; is called &quot;once per thread&quot;. The semantics can be adjusted to &quot;once per process&quot; or &quot;once per object&quot; by qualifying it with a &quot;once key&quot;, e.g. codice_86.

===Conversions===
Eiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. The mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. To avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:

: (Conversion principle) A type may not both conform and convert to another.

For example, codice_87 may conform to codice_88, but codice_2 converts to codice_90 (and does not inherit from it).

The conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between codice_2 and codice_90) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. For example, a codice_93 class may be declared to convert to codice_3; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through
 my_string := my_date
as a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:
 create my_string.make_from_date (my_date)
To make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) codice_95 in a codice_96 clause at the beginning of the class.

As another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from codice_97, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in
 Bastille_day := [14, &quot;July&quot;, 1789]
===Exception handling===
Exception handling in Eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. For example, an exception occurs when a routine&#x27;s caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. In Eiffel, exception handling is not used for control flow or to correct data-input mistakes.

An Eiffel exception handler is defined using the keyword. Within the section, the keyword executes the routine again. For example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:
connect_to_server (server: SOCKET)
 -- Connect to a server or give up after 10 attempts.
 require
 server /= Void and then server.address /= Void
 local
 attempts: INTEGER
 do
 server.connect
 ensure
 connected: server.is_connected
 rescue
 if attempts &lt; 10 then
 attempts := attempts + 1
 retry
 end
 end
This example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. For most programs a routine name like would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.

===Concurrency===
A number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as EiffelNet and EiffelThreads. A concurrency model for Eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is SCOOP, or &quot;Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming&quot;, not yet part of the official language definition but available in EiffelStudio. CAMEO is an (unimplemented) variation of SCOOP for Eiffel. Concurrency also interacts with exceptions. Asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).

===Operator and bracket syntax, assigner commands===
Eiffel&#x27;s view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the &quot;target&quot;. So for example an addition such as
a + b
is conceptually understood as if it were the method call
a.plus (b)
with target codice_59, feature codice_99 and argument codice_100.

Of course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. Operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in codice_2, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):
plus alias &quot;+&quot; (other: INTEGER): INTEGER
 -- ... Normal function declaration...
 end
The range of operators that can be used as &quot;alias&quot; is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as &quot;+&quot; but also &quot;free operators&quot; made of non-alphanumeric symbols. This makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.

Every class may in addition have &quot;one&quot; function aliased to &quot;[]&quot;, the &quot;bracket&quot; operator, allowing the notation codice_102 as a synonym for codice_103 where codice_104 is the chosen function. This is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. For example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written
 number := phone_book [&quot;JILL SMITH&quot;]
&quot;Assigner commands&quot; are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. Assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call &quot;setter&quot; procedures. An assignment proper can never be of the form codice_105 as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). For example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure
item alias &quot;[]&quot; (key: STRING): ELEMENT [3]
 -- The element of key `key&#x27;.
 -- (&quot;Getter&quot; query)
 do
 end

put (e: ELEMENT; key: STRING)
 -- Insert the element `e&#x27;, associating it with the key `key&#x27;.
 -- (&quot;Setter&quot; command)
 do
 end
Then to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:
 [4] phone_book.put (New_person, &quot;JILL SMITH&quot;)
It is possible to write this equivalently as
 [5] phone_book [&quot;JILL SMITH&quot;] := New_person
(in the same way that codice_106 is a synonym for codice_107), provided the declaration of codice_108 now starts (replacement for [3]) with
 item alias &quot;[]&quot; (key: STRING): ELEMENT assign put
This declares codice_109 as the assigner command associated with codice_108 and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (It could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as codice_111.

Note: The argument list of a&#x27;s assigner is constrained to be: (a&#x27;s return type;all of a&#x27;s argument list...)

===Lexical and syntax properties===
Eiffel is not case-sensitive. The tokens codice_7, codice_113 and codice_114 all denote the same identifier. See, however, the &quot;style rules&quot; below.

Comments are introduced by codice_115 (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.

The semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. Most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. This results in less clutter on the program page.

There is no nesting of feature and class declarations. As a result, the structure of an Eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.

It is customary to group features into separate &quot;feature clauses&quot; for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:
class HASH_TABLE [ELEMENT, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE] inherit TABLE [ELEMENT]

 feature -- Initialization
 -- ... Declarations of initialization commands (creation procedures/constructors) ...

 feature -- Access
 -- ... Declarations of non-Boolean queries on the object state, e.g. item ...

 feature -- Status report
 -- ... Declarations of Boolean queries on the object state, e.g. is_empty ...

 feature -- Element change
 -- ... Declarations of commands that change the structure, e.g. put ...

 -- etc.
end
In contrast to most curly bracket programming languages, Eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. This is in line with the Command-Query Separation principle of the Eiffel method.

===Style conventions===
Much of the documentation of Eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. Some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of Eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.

While the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (codice_116), all-lower-case for feature names (codice_7), and initial capitals for constants (codice_118). The recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in codice_119.

The specification of Eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in &quot;codice_120&quot;, comments, operators, and punctuation marks in codice_121, with program text in codice_122 as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. For example, the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program given above would be rendered as below in Eiffel documentation:
class
 HELLO_WORLD
create
 make
feature
 make
 do
 print (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
 end
end
===Interfaces to other tools and languages===
Eiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an open architecture for interfacing with &quot;external&quot; software in any other programming language.

It is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in C. Eiffel provides a straightforward interface to C routines, including support for &quot;inline C&quot; (writing the body of an Eiffel routine in C, typically for short machine-level operations).

There is no direct connection between Eiffel and C. However, many Eiffel compilers (Visual Eiffel is one exception) emit C source code as an intermediate language, to submit to a C compiler, for optimizing or porting. As such, they are examples of transcompilers. The Eiffel Compiler tecomp can execute Eiffel code directly (like an interpreter) without going via an intermediate C code or emit C code which will be passed to a C compiler to obtain optimized native code. On .NET, the EiffelStudio compiler directly generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code. The SmartEiffel compiler can also emit Java bytecode.

<doc id="9839" wikidata="Q191787" url="?curid=9839" title="Ezra">
<text>Ezra (fl. fifth or fourth century BCE) is the main character of the Book of Ezra. According to the Hebrew Bible, he was an important Jewish scribe (&quot;sofer&quot;) and priest (&quot;kohen&quot;) in the early Second Temple period. In the Greek Septuagint, the name is rendered as &#x27; (), from which the Latin name [[Esdras]] comes. His name is probably a shortened Aramaic translation of the Hebrew name (&#x27;), meaning &quot;Yah helps&quot;.

In the Hebrew Bible, or the Christian Old Testament, Ezra is an important figure in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which he is traditionally held to have written and edited, respectively. According to tradition, Ezra was also the author of the Books of Chronicles and the Book of Malachi. He is depicted as instrumental in restoring the Jewish scriptures and religion to the people after the return from the Babylonian Captivity and is a highly respected figure in Judaism. He is regarded as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, which sets his feast day as July 13, the same as that of his contemporary, Nehemiah. He is also venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which sets his feast day on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers.

There is no historical consensus on Ezra’s existence or mission due to a lack of extrabiblical evidence and conflicting scholarly interpretations, ranging from viewing him as a historical Aramean official to a literary figure, with debates hinging on the authenticity of the Artaxerxes rescript and its dating.

==Life==
===In the Hebrew Bible===

The canonical Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah are the oldest sources for the activity of Ezra, whereas many of the other books ascribed to Ezra (First Esdras, 3–6 Ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The book of Ezra–Nehemiah was always written as one scroll. In late medieval Christian bibles, the single book was divided in two, as First and Second Ezra; and this division became Jewish practice in the first printed Hebrew bibles. Modern Hebrew Bibles call the two books Ezra and Nehemiah, as do other modern Bible translations. A few parts of the Book of Ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12–26) were written in Aramaic, and the majority in Hebrew, Ezra himself being skilled in both languages.

According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah, the last High Priest to serve in Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and a close relative of Joshua, the first High Priest of the Second Temple. He returned from Babylonian captivity and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem. According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodox Church, he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic tradition supports the positions that Ezra was an ordinary member of the priesthood, and that he actually served as a Kohen Gadol. Ezra was living in Babylon when in the seventh year of Artaxerxes I, the Achaemenid emperor (), the emperor sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. The Book of Ezra describes how he led a group of Judean exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah.

When Ezra discovered that Jewish men had been marrying foreign pagan women, he tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of foreign blood, a set of commandments described in the Torah. Some years later, Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah, a Jewish noble in his service, as governor in Jerusalem with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed, Nehemiah had Ezra read the Torah to the assembled Israelites and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.

===Burial place===

Several traditions have developed over his place of burial. One tradition says that he is buried in Ezra&#x27;s Tomb near Basra, Iraq while another tradition alleges that he is buried in Tadef near Aleppo in northern Syria.

According to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried &quot;in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem.&quot; If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the pen name &quot;Malachi&quot; is correct, then he was probably buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi, along with two other prophets from Ezra&#x27;s lifetime, Haggai and Zechariah. However, according to archeological research, these tombs date from the 1 century BC.

==In later Second Temple period literature==
===1 Esdras===
1 Esdras, probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a Greek text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra–Nehemiah – in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra–Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.

===Josephus===
The first-century Jewish historian Josephus deals with Ezra in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. He uses the name Xerxes for Artaxerxes I reserving the name Artaxerxes for the later Artaxerxes II whom he identifies as the Ahasuerus of Esther, thus placing Ezra before the events of the book of Esther. Josephus&#x27; account of the deeds of Ezra derives entirely from 1 Esdras, which he cites as the &#x27;Book of Ezra&#x27; in his numeration of the Hebrew bible. Contrariwise, Josephus does not appear to recognise Ezra-Nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of Nehemiah.

===The apocalyptic Ezra traditions===
The apocalyptic fourth book of Ezra (also sometimes called the &#x27;second book of Esdras&#x27; or the &#x27;third book of Esdras&#x27;) was written c. CE 100, probably in Judeo-Aramaic, but now survives in Latin, Slavonic and Ethiopic. In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an angel of God three times and has four visions. Ezra, thirty years into the Babylonian Exile (4 Ezra 3:1 / 2 Esdras 1:1), recounts the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The central theological themes are &quot;the question of theodicy, God&#x27;s justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms, the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on Earth of the heavenly Jerusalem, the Messianic Period, at the end of which the Messiah will die, the end of this world and the coming of the next, and the Last Judgment.&quot; Ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the Temple in Jerusalem. He dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works). At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.

There is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the &quot;Greek Apocalypse of Ezra&quot;.

==In rabbinic literature==
Traditionally Judaism credits Ezra with establishing the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the Sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism in something like their present form, including Torah reading, the Amidah, and celebration of the feast of Purim.

In Rabbinic traditions, Ezra is metaphorically referred to as the &quot;flowers that appear on the earth&quot; signifying the springtime in the national history of Judaism. A disciple of Baruch ben Neriah, he favored study of the Law over the reconstruction of the Temple and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to Jerusalem in the reign of Cyrus. According to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with Joshua ben Jozadak for the office of High Priest of Israel.

According to Jewish tradition, Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles, and is the same prophet known also as Malachi. There is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not Ezra had served as High Priest of Israel.

According to the Babylonian Talmud, Ezra the Scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders, which are as follows:
# That the public come together to read from the sefer Torah on Shabbatot during the time of the afternoon oblation (Minchah), because of those travelling merchants who loiter in the closed shops in the street corners, and who may have missed the biblical lections that were read during the weekdays.
# That the courts be opened throughout the Jewish townships on Mondays and Thursdays.
# That women would not wait beyond Thursday to launder their clothes, because of the honor due to the Sabbath day.
# That men would accustom themselves to eat [cooked] garlic on the eve of the Sabbath (believed to enhance love between a man and his wife).
# That women would rise up early on Friday mornings to bake bread, so that a piece of bread would be available for the poor.
# That Jewish women in every place be girded with a wide belt (waist band), whether from the front or from behind, out of modesty.
# That Jewish women, during their menses, wash and comb their hair three days prior to their purification in a ritual bath.
# That the traveling merchants make regular rounds into the Jewish villages and townships because of the honor due to the daughters of Israel (&quot;viz&quot;., so that jewelry can be purchased by the daughters of Israel).
# That Jewish women and/or girls, as a precautionary measure, be accustomed to conversing with one another while one of their party goes out to relieve herself in the outhouse.
# That men who may have suffered a seminal emission (especially after accompanying with their wives) be required to immerse themselves in a mikveh before being permitted to read from the scroll of the Law.

In the Syrian village of Tedef, a synagogue said to be the place where Ezra stopped over has been venerated by Jews for centuries. Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.

==In Christian traditions==
In Christian tradition, Ezra is considered to be the author of the book of Ezra and 1 and 2 Chronicles. Due to the strong similarity between the books of Malachi and Ezra, some Christian traditions adopt the Jewish view that Ezra was Malachi; Jerome was one prominent Christian who held this view.

Early Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. Clement of Alexandria in his &quot;Stromata&quot; referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 Esdras. Where early Christian writers refer to the &#x27;Book of Ezra&#x27; it is always the text of 1 Esdras that is being cited.

==In Islam==

In Islam, he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. Although he was not mentioned as one of the Prophets of Islam, he is considered one of them by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. His tomb at Al-ʻUzer on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs. Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzer as &quot;Ezra&quot;; for example, Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates ‘Uzayr with Enoch and Metatron.

==Academic view==
===Timeline===
Scholars debate the dating of Ezra’s mission due to textual emendations and lack of extrabiblical evidence, with proposed timelines placing his activity either during the reign of Artaxerxes I or Artaxerxes II, complicating the historical context and relationship with Nehemiah. Ezra came to Jerusalem &quot;in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the King&quot;. The text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465–424 BCE) or to Artaxerxes II (404–359 BCE). Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra &quot;seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions seem to have no overlap&quot;. These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard &quot;the seventh year&quot; as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.
However, in Nehemiah 8, Nehemiah has Ezra read the Torah to the people. So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem were rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint. There is a much clearer problem with the timeline in a story from Ezra 4, that tells of a letter that was sent to Artaxerxes asking to stop the rebuilding of the temple (which started during the reign of Cyrus and then restarted in the second year of Darius, in 521 BCE). Clearly no such letter could have been sent to Artaxerxes, as he only became king in 465 BCE, so apparently some events detailing the resistance of leaders of nearby peoples against the works of Nehemiah must have been confused with events during the days of Zerubbabel.

===Historicity===
There is no historical consensus on Ezra’s existence or mission due to a lack of extrabiblical evidence and conflicting scholarly interpretations, ranging from viewing him as a historical Aramean official to a literary figure, with debates hinging on the authenticity of the Artaxerxes rescript and its dating.

Mary Joan Winn Leith in &quot;The Oxford History of the Biblical World&quot; believes that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture and given a theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the &#x27;father of Judaism&#x27; in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.

Richard Friedman argues in his book &quot;Who Wrote the Bible?&quot; that Ezra is the one who redacted the Torah, and in fact effectively produced the first Torah. It has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, Ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the Torah together.

One particular aspect of Ezra&#x27;s story considered dubious historically is the account in Ezra 7 of his commission. According to it, Ezra was given truly exalted status by the king: he was seemingly put in charge of the entire western half of the Persian Empire, a position apparently above even the level of the satraps (regional governors). Ezra was given vast hoards of treasure to take with him to Jerusalem as well as a letter where the king seemingly acknowledges the sovereignty of the God of Israel. Yet, his actions in the story do not appear to be that of someone with near unlimited government power, and the alleged letter from a Persian king is written with Hebraisms and Jewish idiom.

Biblical scholar Tova Ganzel has recently argued that Ezra&#x27;s status as both priest and scribe fits well in its fifth century BCE historical context in light of parallels with the Babylonian temple scribes of the Neo-Babylonian and Persian Periods.

<text>Elijah ( ) or Elias was a prophet and miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible. 

In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Hebrew deity Yahweh over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection, bringing fire down from the sky, and ascending to heaven alive. He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as &quot;the sons of the prophets.&quot; Following Elijah&#x27;s ascension, his disciple and devoted assistant Elisha took over as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah&#x27;s return &quot;before the coming of the great and terrible day of the ,&quot; making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Sirach, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, and Baháʼí writings. Scholars generally agree that a historical figure named Elijah existed in ancient Israel, though the biblical accounts of his life are considered more legendary and theologically reflective than historically accurate.

In Judaism, Elijah&#x27;s name is invoked at the weekly Havdalah rite that marks the end of Shabbat, and Elijah is invoked in other Jewish customs, among them the Passover Seder and the brit milah (ritual circumcision). He appears in numerous stories and references in the Haggadah and rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. According to some Jewish interpretations, Elijah will return during the End of Times.

The Christian New Testament notes that some people thought that Jesus was, in some sense, Elijah, but it also makes clear that John the Baptist is &quot;the Elijah&quot; who was promised to come in Malachi 3:1; 4:5. According to accounts in all three of the Synoptic Gospels, Elijah appeared with Moses during the Transfiguration of Jesus.

Elijah in Islam appears in the Quran as a prophet and messenger of God, where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of Baal is recounted in a concise form.

Due to his importance to Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, Elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1752.

== Biblical accounts ==
According to the Bible, by the 9th century BC, the Kingdom of Israel, once united under Solomon, had been divided into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah (which retained the historical capital of Jerusalem along with its Temple). Omri, King of Israel, continued policies dating from the reign of Jeroboam, contrary to religious law, that were intended to reorient religious focus away from Jerusalem: encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices, appointing priests from outside the family of the Levites, and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to Baal, an important deity in ancient Canaanite religion. Omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son Ahab and princess Jezebel, a worshipper of Baal and the daughter of the king of Sidon in Phoenicia. These solutions brought security and economic prosperity to Israel for a time, but did not bring peace with the Israelite prophets, who advocated a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law.

Under Ahab&#x27;s kingship tensions exacerbated. Ahab built a temple for Baal, and his wife Jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of Baal and Asherah into the country. In this context Elijah is introduced in 1 Kings 17:1 as Elijah &quot;the Tishbite.&quot; He warns Ahab that there will be years of catastrophic drought so severe that not even dew will form, because Ahab and his queen stand at the end of a line of kings of Israel who are said to have &quot;done evil in the sight of the Lord.&quot;

=== Books of Kings ===
No background for the person of Elijah is given except for his brief characterization as a Tishbite. His name in Hebrew means &quot;My God is Jah,&quot; and may be a title applied to him because of his challenge to worship of Baal.

As told in the Hebrew Bible, Elijah&#x27;s challenge is bold and direct. Baal was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.
Elijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.
==== Widow of Zarephath ====

After Elijah&#x27;s confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of Zarephath in Phoenicia.

When Elijah finds her, he asks her for some water and a piece of bread, but she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, &quot;Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of flour will not be used up, and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.&quot; She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah&#x27;s promise miraculously comes true.
Some time later the widow&#x27;s son dies and the widow cries, &quot;You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!&quot; Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God&#x27;s word might be demonstrated, and &quot;[God] listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.&quot; This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. The widow cried, &quot;the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.&quot;

After more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought. While on his way, Elijah meets Obadiah, the head of Ahab&#x27;s household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel&#x27;s violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah&#x27;s whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.

==== Challenge to Baal ====
When Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the &quot;troubler of Israel&quot; but Elijah retorts that Ahab himself is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of false gods.

At Elijah&#x27;s instruction, Ahab summons the people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah to Mount Carmel. Elijah then berates the people for their acquiescence in Baal worship: &quot;How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.&quot;

Elijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and Yahweh (both Asherah and her prophets disappear from the story entirely): he and Baal&#x27;s prophets will each take one of two bulls, prepare it for sacrifice and lay it on wood, but put no fire to it. The prophets of Baal choose and prepare a bull accordingly. Elijah then invites them to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. &quot;At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, &#x27;Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&#x27;&quot; They respond by shouting louder and slashing themselves with swords and spears. They continue praying until evening without success.

Elijah then repairs Yahweh&#x27;s altar with twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Elijah digs a trench around it and prepares the other bull for sacrifice as before. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from &quot;four large jars&quot; poured three times, filling also the trench. He asks Yahweh to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. When the people see this, they declare, &quot;The he is God; the he is God.&quot; Elijah then orders them to seize the prophets of Baal, which they do, and Elijah brings them down to the River Kishon and slays them, at which the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.

==== Mount Horeb ====
Jezebel, enraged that Elijah has killed the prophets of Baal, threatens to kill him. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death and eventually falling asleep. At length an angel of the Lord rouses him gently, telling him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water, eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel then comes to him a second time, telling him to eat and drink afresh, because he has a long journey ahead of him.

Elijah travels for forty days and forty nights to Mount Horeb, where Moses had received the Ten Commandments. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a cave. Elijah is told to &quot;Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the , for the is about to pass by.&quot; There comes a mighty wind, then an earthquake and then fire, but Yahweh is not in any of these, choosing to come instead as a still, small voice, which bids Elijah go forth again - this time to Damascus to anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as the old prophet&#x27;s successor.

==== Vineyard of Naboth ====
Elijah encounters Ahab again in 1 Kings 21, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters in Ahab&#x27;s name to the elders and nobles who live near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.

God again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: &quot;Have you killed, and also taken possession?&quot; and, &quot;In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.&quot; Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents so sincerely that God stays his hand in punishing Ahab, choosing instead to vent his wrath upon Jezebel and her son by Ahab, Ahaziah.

==== Ahaziah ====

Elijah&#x27;s story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with Ahaziah (2 Kings 1). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of Baalzebub in Ekron, outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message &quot;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?&quot; Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.

Ahaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah&#x27;s word.

==== Departure ====
According to 2 Kings 2:3–9, Elisha (Eliseus) and &quot;the sons of the prophets&quot; knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to &quot;let a double portion&quot; of Elijah&#x27;s &quot;spirit&quot; be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be &quot;taken&quot;.

Elijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water. The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.

=== Books of Chronicles ===

Elijah is mentioned once more in 2 Chronicles 21:12, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet&#x27;s name to Jehoram of Judah. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death.

This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with &quot;Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...&quot; rather than the more usual &quot;...in the name of YHVH the God of Israel.&quot; Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah&#x27;s ascension into the whirlwind.

Michael Wilcock, formerly of Trinity College, Bristol, suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet&#x27;s name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet. John Van Seters, however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition. However, Wilcock argues that Elijah&#x27;s letter &quot;does address a very &#x27;northern&#x27; situation in the southern kingdom&quot;, and thus is authentic.

=== In Malachi ===
While the final mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible is in the Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible&#x27;s reordering places the Book of Malachi (which prophesies a messiah) as the final book of the Old Testament, before the New Testament gospels. Thus, Elijah&#x27;s final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, &quot;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.&quot;

== Historicity ==
Scholars generally agree that a prophet named Elijah existed in the Kingdom of Israel during the reigns of Kings Ahab and Ahaziah, that he was a religious figure of great personal dynamism and conservative zeal and the leader of resistance to the rise of Baal worship in Israel in the ninth century BC.

However, the biblical presentation of the prophet cannot be taken as historical documentation of his activity. The biblical texts present his career through the eyes of popular legend and subsequent theological reflection, which consider him a personality of heroic proportions. In this process his actions and relations to the people and the King became stereotyped, and the presentation of his behavior paradigmatic.

== In the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books ==
Jewish legends about Elijah abound in the Aggadah, which is found throughout various collections of rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his deathor &quot;translation&quot;ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.

From the time of Malachi, who says of Elijah that God will send him before &quot;the great and dreadful day&quot;, down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.

=== Origin ===
Three different theories regarding Elijah&#x27;s origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:
(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,
(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in 1 Chronicles 8:27, and
(3) he was a priest.

Many Christian Church fathers also have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with Phinehas.

According to later Kabbalistic literature, Elijah was really an angel in human form, so that he had neither parents nor offspring.

The Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states &quot;Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite&quot; indicating he surely had parents.

The Talmud states &quot;Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?&quot;

=== Zeal for God ===
A midrash tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel&#x27;s accuser before God.

In the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God&#x27;s mercy, instead of becoming Israel&#x27;s accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.

The vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through &quot;four worlds.&quot; This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.

Three years after this vision, Elijah was &quot;translated.&quot; Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.

But as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper. In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah, but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.

=== Ecclesiasticus ===

Elijah&#x27;s glory is honoured in the Book of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus). His designated tasks are altered to:
*calming God&#x27;s fury,
*restoring familial peace, and
*restoring the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

== In Judaism ==
=== Elijah&#x27;s chair ===

At Jewish circumcision ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at Mount Horeb: Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God&#x27;s presence and power on Mount Carmel. God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: &quot;I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away&quot;. According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah&#x27;s words were patently untrue, and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.

=== Elijah&#x27;s cup ===

In the Talmudic literature, Elijah would visit rabbis to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the eschaton. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision &quot;until Elijah comes&quot;.

One such decision was whether the Passover Seder required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the &quot;four expressions of redemption&quot; in the Book of Exodus:
I am the Lord, and &quot;I will bring you out&quot; from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and &quot;I will deliver you&quot; from their bondage, and &quot;I will redeem you&quot; with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and &quot;I will take you&quot; for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.&quot;

The next verse, &quot;And &quot;I will bring you&quot; into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.&quot; was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.

In practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah&#x27;s and is used for no other purpose.

=== Havdalah ===

Havdalah is the ceremony that concludes the Sabbath Day (Saturday evening in Jewish tradition). As part of the concluding hymn, an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. &quot;Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.&quot;

== In Jewish folklore ==
The volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah&#x27;s miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron. Because of Phinehas&#x27; zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, &quot;a covenant of lasting priesthood.&quot; Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel Sandalphon, whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him. Yet another name for Elijah is &quot;Angel of the Covenant&quot;

=== Rabbi Joshua ben Levi ===
References to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood) to lengthy parables on the nature of God&#x27;s justice.

One such story is that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah&#x27;s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet&#x27;s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man&#x27;s wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.

Finally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. &quot;Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.&quot;

=== Rabbi Eliezer ===
The Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, &quot;Peace be with thee, Rabbi.&quot; Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, &quot;How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?&quot; Elijah responded with, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.&quot; The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.

=== Lilith ===
Elijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of Lilith. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.

Elijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, &quot;Unclean one, where are you going?&quot; Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.

Elijah pronounced his malediction, &quot;I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!&quot; But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to &quot;forsake my evil ways&quot; if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, &quot;where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.&quot;

== In Christianity ==
=== New Testament ===
In the New Testament, Jesus would say for those who believed, John the Baptist was Elijah, who would come before the &quot;great and terrible day&quot; as predicted by Malachi.

Some English translations of the New Testament use Elias, a Greek form of the name. In the King James Version, &quot;Elias&quot; appears only in the texts translated from Greek.

==== John the Baptist ====
John the Baptist preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel&#x27;s hair secured with a leather girdle. He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.

In the Gospel of John, when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) &quot;Art thou Elias&quot;, he replied &quot;I am not&quot;. Matthew 11:14 and Matthew 17:10–13 however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in Luke, Gabriel appears to Zechariah, John&#x27;s father, and told him that John &quot;will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,&quot; and that he will go forth &quot;in the spirit and power of Elijah.&quot;

==== Transfiguration ====
Elijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the Transfiguration.

At the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus&#x27; face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is &quot;My beloved Son.&quot; The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three &quot;tabernacles&quot;: one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.

There is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus &quot;I perceive thou art a prophet.&quot; Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced Son of God.

==== Other references ====
Elijah is mentioned four more times in the New Testament: in Luke, Romans, Hebrews, and James. In Luke 4:24–27, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets. Jesus says, &quot;No prophet is accepted in his own country,&quot; and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In Romans 11:1–6, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God&#x27;s never forsaking his people (the Israelites). Hebrews 11:35 (&quot;Women received their dead raised to life again...&quot;) refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha raising the son of the woman of Shunem, citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith. In James 5:16–18, James says, &quot;The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,&quot; and then cites Elijah&#x27;s prayers which started and ended the famine in Israel as examples.

=== Prophet saint ===
In Western Christianity, Elijah is commemorated as a saint with a feast day on 20 July by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Catholics believe that he was unmarried and celibate.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is commemorated on the same date (in the 21st century, Julian Calendar 20 July corresponds to Gregorian Calendar 2 August). He is greatly revered among the Orthodox as a model of the contemplative life. He is also commemorated on the Orthodox liturgical calendar on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).

Elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 26 August 1752, replacing George of Lydda at the request of Bishop Pavao Dragičević. The reasons for the replacement are unclear. It has been suggested that Elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina—Catholics, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. Pope Benedict XIV is said to have approved Bishop Dragičević&#x27;s request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron.

Prophet Elias is commemorated by the Catholic Church on 17 June. He is also commemorated by Eastern Orthodox Church on April 14 with all saint Sinai monks.

==== Carmelite tradition ====

Elijah is revered as the spiritual Father and traditional founder of the Catholic religious Order of Carmelites. In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and Discalced Carmelite traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet&#x27;s withdrawal from public life. The medieval Carmelite Book of the First Monks offers some insight into the heart of the Orders&#x27; contemplative vocation and reverence for the prophet. In 1725, the Holy See of the Catholic Church, during the reign of Pope Benedict XIII, allowed the Carmelites to place a statue of the Prophet Elias in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, denoting him as their founder.

In the 17th century the Bollandist Society, whose declared aim was to search out and classify materials concerning the saints venerated by the Church, and to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information entered into controversy with the Carmelites on this point. In writing of St. Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist Daniel Papebroch stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly. From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of Jean de Launoy and the Sorbonne. In November 1698, Pope Innocent XII ordered an end to the controversy.

==== Liturgical commemorations ====
Since most Eastern Churches either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, &quot;Elias&quot; (or its modern iotacized form &quot;Ilias&quot;) is the form of the prophet&#x27;s name used among most members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite.

The feast day of Saint Elias falls on 20 July of the Orthodox liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 20 July currently falls on 2 August of the modern Gregorian Calendar). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.

Elias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).

The Apolytikion in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:

The incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.

The Kontakion in the Second Tone for St. Elias:

O Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.

==== Pagan associations and mountaintops ====
Starting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with Helios, the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the holocaust sacrifice offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven corresponds to the sun warming the earth.

Sedulius writes poetically in the fifth century that the &quot;bright path to glittering heaven&quot; suits Elias both &quot;in merits and name&quot;, as changing one letter makes his name &quot;Helios&quot;; but he does not identify the two. A homily entitled &quot;De ascensione Heliae&quot;, misattributed to Chrysostom, claims that poets and painters use the ascension of Elijah as a model for their depictions of the sun, and says that &quot;Elijah is really Helios&quot;. Saint Patrick appears to conflate Helios and Elias. In modern times, much Greek folklore also connects Elias with the sun.

In Greece, chapels and monasteries dedicated to Prophet Elias (Προφήτης Ηλίας) are often found on mountaintops, which themselves are often named after him. Since Wachsmuth (1864), the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias. The modern folklore is not good evidence for the &quot;origin&quot; of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops. Perhaps Elias is simply a &quot;natural patron of high places&quot;.

The association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with Zeus, especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lightning, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of Baal, it was on Mount Carmel which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on Mount Horeb. When Elias confronted Ahab, he stopped the rains for three years.

A map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including Mount Olympus, Mount Lykaion, Mount Arachnaion, and Mount Taleton on the mainland, and Mount Kenaion, Mount Oche, and Mount Kynados in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.

Elias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.

Among Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to Ljuboten on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as &quot;Aligjyn&quot; (&quot;Ali Day&quot;), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.
As Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted Slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for Perun, the supreme Slavic god of storms, thunder and lightning bolts. In many Slavic countries Elijah is known as Elijah the Thunderer (&quot;Ilija Gromovnik&quot;), who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow, thus actually taking the place of Perun in popular beliefs. Perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero Elijah of Murom. The feast of St. Elias is known as &quot;Ilinden&quot; in South Slavic, and was chosen as the day of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903; it is now the holiday of Republic Day in North Macedonia.

In Estonian folklore Elijah is considered to be the successor of Ukko, the lightning spirit.

In Georgian mythology, he replaces Elwa. A Georgian story about Elijah:
Once Jesus, the prophet Elijah, and St. George were going through Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (After Elijah, Jesus and St. George attempt to get help and eventually succeed).
Among other peoples of the Caucasus, including the Ossetians and Kabardians, Elijah is understood as a kind of thunder-divinity named Uac-illa, Ilia, or Yeli, and was traditionally invoked in &quot;choppa&quot; ritual associated with lightning strikes and certain mental illnesses. If a person or animal was struck by lightning, a circle dance was performed immediately around the site, even if the storm was still ongoing, and Elijah&#x27;s name was invoked alongside a nonsense word &quot;choppa&quot; or &quot;coppay&quot;. If the victim had died, their family were forbidden from grieving and were required to bury them where they fell instead of in the village cemetery. If the victim survived, their lives were dedicated to Elijah: human survivors were prophets, while animals were released with a mark so that others would know not to take them home. In other versions of this tradition, the one venerated was not Elijah, but other traditional thunder-divinities like Shyble (Щыблэ), Afy (Афы), or Antswa (Анцуа).

Elias has other pagan associations: a modern legend about Elias mirrors precisely the legend of Odysseus seeking a place where the locals would not recognize an oar—hence the mountaintops.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acknowledges Elijah as a prophet. The Church teaches that the Malachi prophecy of the return of Elijah was fulfilled on 3 April 1836, when Elijah visited the prophet and founder of the church, Joseph Smith, along with Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland Temple as a resurrected being. This event is chronicled in . This experience forms the basis for the church&#x27;s focus on genealogy and family history and belief in the eternal nature of marriage and families.

In Latter-day Saint theology, the name-title Elias is not always synonymous with Elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet. According to Joseph Smith,

The spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second, and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after, holding the keys of power, building the Temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the Melchizedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all things ready; then Messiah comes to His Temple, which is last of all.

People to whom the title Elias is applied in Mormonism include Noah, the angel Gabriel (who is considered to be the same person as Noah in Mormon doctrine), Elijah, John the Baptist, John the Apostle, and an unspecified man who was a contemporary of Abraham.

Detractors of Mormonism have often alleged that Smith, in whose time and place the King James Version was the only available English translation of the Bible, simply failed to grasp the fact that the Elijah of the Old Testament and the Elias of the New Testament are the same person. Latter-day Saints deny this and say that the difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic. The names Elias and Elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the Lord. This is applicable to John the Baptist coming to prepare the way for the Lord and His baptism; it also refers to Elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for Jesus by restoring keys of sealing power. Jesus then gave this power to the Twelve saying, &quot;Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;

== In Islam ==

Elijah () is mentioned as a prophet in . Elijah&#x27;s narrative in the Quran and later Muslim tradition resembles closely that in the Hebrew Bible and Muslim literature records Elijah&#x27;s primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of Ahab and Jezebel as well as Ahaziah. He is seen by Muslims to be the prophetic predecessor to Elisha. While neither the Bible nor the Quran mentions the genealogy of Elijah, some scholars of Islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet Aaron. While Elijah is associated with Islamic eschatology, Islam views Jesus as the Messiah. However, Elijah is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure known as Khidr during the Last Judgment. Elijah&#x27;s figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints, including Idris, which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for Elijah, and Khidr. Islamic legend later developed the figure of Elijah, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave Elijah the status of a half-human, half-angel. Elijah also appears in later works of literature, including the &quot;Hamzanama&quot;.

=== Quran ===
Elijah is mentioned in the Quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of Baal, the primary idol of the area. The Quran states, &quot;And Elias was indeed one of the messengers. ˹Remember˺ when he said to his people, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺? Do you call upon ˹the idol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators— Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?” &quot; 

The Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah&#x27;s people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of God among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, &quot;But they rejected him, so they will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺. But not the chosen servants of Allah. We blessed him ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations: &quot;

In the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:

Numerous commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, have offered commentary on Al-An’am 6: 85 saying that Elijah, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus were all spiritually connected. Abdullah Yusuf Ali says, &quot;The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: &quot;the Righteous.&quot; They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as &quot;Elias, which was for to come&quot; (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3).&quot;

=== Literature and tradition ===
Muslim literature and tradition recounts that Elijah preached to the Kingdom of Israel, ruled over by Ahab and later his son Ahaziah. He is believed to have been a &quot;prophet of the desert—like John the Baptist&quot;. Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of God to Israel after him.

Elijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with Muhammad himself. In Islamic mysticism, Elijah is associated closely with the sage Khidr. One hadith reported that Elijah and Khidr met together every year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca. Elijah appears also in the &quot;Hamzanama&quot; numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drank from the Fountain of Youth.

Further, It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: 
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?&quot; To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, &quot;Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you&quot;.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Although most Muslim scholars believed that Elijah preached in Israel, some early commentators on the Quran stated that Elijah was sent to Baalbek, in Lebanon. Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city&#x27;s name, that of &quot;Baal&quot;, which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. Scholars who reject identification of Elijah&#x27;s town with Baalbek further argue that the town of Baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of Elijah in either the Quran or the Hebrew Bible.

== In Druze religion ==

Druze tradition honors several “mentors” and “prophets”, and Elijah is honored as a prophet. Elijah is considered a central figure in Druze. And due to his importance in the religion, the settlement of Druzes on Mount Carmel had partly to do with Elijah&#x27;s story and devotion. There are two large Druze towns on the eastern slopes of Mount Carmel: Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya. The Druze regard the Cave of Elijah as holy, and they identify Elijah as &quot;al-Khidr&quot;, the green prophet who symbolizes water and life, a miracle who cures the sick. He and Jethro (Shuaib) are considered patron saints of the Druze people.
Druze, like some Christians, believe that Elijah came back as John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul, Druze believe that El Khidr and John the Baptist are one and the same; along with Saint George.

Due to the Christian influence on the Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze&#x27;s favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druze and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druze appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and Saint Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.

== In Baháʼí Faith ==
In the Baháʼí Faith, the Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith, is believed to be the return of Elijah and John the Baptist. Both Elijah and John the Baptist are considered to be Lesser Prophets, whose stations are below that of a Manifestation of God like Jesus Christ, Buddha, the Báb or Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. The Báb is buried on Mount Carmel, where Elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of Baal.

== Controversies ==
=== Miracle of the ravens ===
That ravens fed Elijah by the brook Chorath has been questioned. The Hebrew text at 1 Kings 17:4–6 uses the word &quot;`ōrvīm&quot;, which means &quot;ravens&quot;, but with a different vocalization might equally mean &quot;Arabs&quot;. The Septuagint has , &quot;ravens&quot;, and other traditional translations followed.

Alternatives have been proposed for many years; for example Adam Clarke (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing. Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.

Prof. John Gray chooses &quot;Arabs&quot;, saying &quot;We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.&quot; His translation of the verses in question is:

And the word of YHWH came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of YHWH and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.

===Fire on Mount Carmel===
The challenge to the priests of Baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the God of Israel was greater than Baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain. According to J. Robinson, &quot;Some scholars have suggested that the pouring of water was a piece of sympathetic magic.&quot;

Hugo Gressmann suggested that the fire that destroyed the offering and altar was lightning, while Ferdinand Hitzig and others thought the water poured on the sacrifice and into the ditch might have been flammable naphtha. Baptist scholar H. H. Rowley rejects both views. Robinson dismisses the suggestion of naphtha with the view that the priests of Baal would have been aware of the properties of naphtha. Julian Morgenstern rejects the idea of sympathetic magic, but supports the interpretation of white naphtha possibly ignited by a glass or mirror to focus the sun&#x27;s rays, citing other mentions of sacred fire, as in 2 Maccabees 1:18–22.

=== Ascension into the heavens ===
Elijah&#x27;s name typically occurs in Jewish lists of those who have entered heaven alive.

In the Gospel of John, Jesus says: &quot;And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [&quot;even&quot;] the Son of man which is in heaven.&quot; Traditionally Christianity interprets the &quot;Son of Man&quot; as a title of Jesus, but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations. Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven or with King Jehoram of Judah.

The question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21:12 after Elijah had ascended. Some have suggested that the letter was written before Elijah ascended, but only delivered later. The rabbinical Seder Olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension. This is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; when dealing with this issue. Others have argued that Elijah was only &quot;caught away&quot; such as Philip in Acts 8 John Lightfoot reasoned that it must have been a different Elijah.

=== Return ===
The Jewish nation awaits the coming of Elijah to precede the coming of the Messiah. 

For Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospel. After Elijah appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses, Jesus explains to his disciples that John the Baptist, recently beheaded by Herod Antipas, had been Elijah reincarnate. Commentators have said that Moses&#x27; appearance represented the law, while Elijah&#x27;s appearance represented the prophets. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Elijah returned on 3 April 1836 in an appearance to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, fulfilling the prophecy in Malachi.

The Baháʼí Faith believes Elijah returned as the biblical prophet John the Baptist and as the Báb who founded the Bábí Faith in 1844. Druze, like Baháʼí Faith believes, believe that Elijah came back as John the Baptist,

The American founded Nation of Islam believes Elijah returned as Elijah Muhammad, black separatist religious leader (who claimed to be a &quot;messenger&quot;, not a prophet). This is considered less important than their belief that Allah himself showed up in the person of Fard Muhammad, the founder of the group. It differs notably from most beliefs about Elijah, in that his re-appearance is usually the precursor to a greater one&#x27;s appearance, rather than an afterthought.

== In arts and literature ==
* Perhaps the best-known representation of the story of Elijah is Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot;. The oratorio chronicles many episodes of Elijah&#x27;s life, including his challenge to Ahab and the contest of the gods, the miracle of raising the dead, and his ascension into heaven. Composed and premiered in 1846, the oratorio was criticized by members of the New German School but nonetheless remains one of the most popular Romantic choral-orchestral works in the repertoire.
* In his ethnography &quot;Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape&quot;, anthropologist Safet HadžiMuhamedović discusses the syncretic harvest feast of Elijah&#x27;s Day (&quot;Ilindan/Aliđun&quot;), shared by Christians and Muslims throughout Bosnia. He focuses on the Field of Gacko in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. Starting with a well-known Bosnian proverb about Elijah&#x27;s two names &quot;Ilija until noon - Alija after noon&quot; (&quot;Do podne Ilija, od podne Alija&quot;), HadžiMuhamedović discusses the traditional and postwar waiting for Elijah, as well as the plethora of other characters he merges with (e.g. Slavic deity Perun and prophet Khidr). As the central trope in the book, the waiting for Elijah becomes the waiting for the restoration of home and cosmology after nationalist violence. The absence of Elijah is reminiscent of the one in Jewish rituals and HadžiMuhamedović discovers an imaginative form of political resistance in the waiting for Elijah&#x27;s return.

<doc id="9841" wikidata="Q923164" url="?curid=9841" title="Expressive aphasia">
<text>Expressive aphasia (also known as Broca&#x27;s aphasia) is a type of aphasia characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual, or written), although comprehension generally remains intact. A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words but leaves out function words that have more grammatical significance than physical meaning, such as prepositions and articles. This is known as &quot;telegraphic speech&quot;. The person&#x27;s intended message may still be understood, but their sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances. Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.

It is caused by acquired damage to the frontal regions of the brain, such as Broca&#x27;s area. Expressive aphasia contrasts with receptive aphasia, in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance and generally also have trouble with comprehension. Expressive aphasia differs from dysarthria, which is typified by a patient&#x27;s inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. Expressive aphasia also differs from apraxia of speech, which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for conscious speech.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Broca&#x27;s (expressive) aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia in which an individual&#x27;s speech is halting and effortful. Misarticulations or distortions of consonants and vowels, namely phonetic dissolution, are common. Individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three. Long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable. The prosody of a person with Broca&#x27;s aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies. Intonation and stress patterns are also deficient.

For example, in the following passage, a patient with Broca&#x27;s aphasia is trying to explain how he came to the hospital for dental surgery:The speech of a person with expressive aphasia contains mostly content words such as nouns, verbs, and some adjectives. However, function words like conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are rarely used except for &quot;and&quot; which is prevalent in the speech of most patients with aphasia. The omission of function words makes the person&#x27;s speech agrammatic. A communication partner of a person with aphasia may say that the person&#x27;s speech sounds telegraphic due to poor sentence construction and disjointed words. For example, a person with expressive aphasia might say &quot;Smart... university... smart... good... good...&quot;

Self-monitoring is typically well preserved in patients with Broca&#x27;s aphasia. They are usually aware of their communication deficits, and are more prone to depression and outbursts from frustration than are patients with other forms of aphasia.

In general, word comprehension is preserved, allowing patients to have functional receptive language skills. Individuals with Broca&#x27;s aphasia understand most of the everyday conversation around them, but higher-level deficits in receptive language can occur. Because comprehension is substantially impaired for more complex sentences, it is better to use simple language when speaking with an individual with expressive aphasia. This is exemplified by the difficulty to understand phrases or sentences with unusual structure. A typical patient with Broca&#x27;s aphasia will misinterpret &quot;the man is bitten by the dog&quot; by switching the subject and object to &quot;the dog is bitten by the man.&quot;

Typically, people with expressive aphasia can understand speech and read better than they can produce speech and write. The person&#x27;s writing will resemble their speech and will be effortful, lacking cohesion, and containing mostly content words. Letters will likely be formed clumsily and distorted and some may even be omitted. Although listening and reading are generally intact, subtle deficits in both reading and listening comprehension are almost always present during assessment of aphasia.

Because Broca&#x27;s area is anterior to the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for movement of the face, hands, and arms, a lesion affecting Broca&#x27;s areas may also result in hemiparesis (weakness of both limbs on the same side of the body) or hemiplegia (paralysis of both limbs on the same side of the body). The brain is wired contralaterally, which means the limbs on right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere and vice versa. Therefore, when Broca&#x27;s area or surrounding areas in the left hemisphere are damaged, hemiplegia or hemiparesis often occurs on the right side of the body in individuals with Broca&#x27;s aphasia.

Severity of expressive aphasia varies among patients. Some people may only have mild deficits and detecting problems with their language may be difficult. In the most extreme cases, patients may be able to produce only a single word. Even in such cases, over-learned and rote-learned speech patterns may be retained– for instance, some patients can count from one to ten, but cannot produce the same numbers in novel conversation.

===Manual language and aphasia===
In deaf patients who use manual language (such as American Sign Language), damage to the left hemisphere of the brain leads to disruptions in their signing ability. Paraphasic errors similar to spoken language have been observed; whereas in spoken language a phonemic substitution would occur (e.g. &quot;tagle&quot; instead of &quot;table&quot;), in ASL case studies errors in movement, hand position, and morphology have been noted. Agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of ASL who have left hemisphere damage. The lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather area manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain. Similar symptoms have been seen in a patient with left hemisphere damage whose first language was British Sign Language, further showing that damage to the left hemisphere primarily hinders linguistic ability, not motor ability. In contrast, patients who have damage to non-linguistic areas on the left hemisphere have been shown to be fluent in signing, but are unable to comprehend written language.

===Overlap with receptive aphasia===
In addition to difficulty expressing oneself, individuals with expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly have trouble with comprehension in certain linguistic areas. This agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia. The most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object Wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic at the beginning of the sentence). These three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence. This is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many people with aphasia rely heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.

==Causes==

=== More common ===
* Stroke or brain anoxia.
* Brain tumor
* Brain trauma

=== Less common ===
* Autoimmune disease
* Paraneoplastic syndrome
* Micrometastasis
* neurodegenerative disorders
* Certain infections (e.g., &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;)
* Metabolic disease (e.g., hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state)

==== Common causes ====
The most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke. A stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by thrombosis or embolism. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients. Expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.

In most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in Broca&#x27;s area or the surrounding vicinity. Broca&#x27;s area is in the lower part of the premotor cortex in the language dominant hemisphere and is responsible for planning motor speech movements. However, cases of expressive aphasia have been seen in patients with strokes in other areas of the brain. Patients with classic symptoms of expressive aphasia in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as global aphasia or left unclassified.

Expressive aphasia can also be caused by trauma to the brain, tumor, cerebral hemorrhage and by extradural abscess.

Understanding lateralization of brain function is important for understanding which areas of the brain cause expressive aphasia when damaged. In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca&#x27;s area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.

==== Uncommon causes ====
Less common causes of expressive aphasia include primary autoimmune phenomenon and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a paraneoplastic syndrome) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits. Many case reports exist describing paraneoplastic aphasia, and the reports that are specific tend to describe expressive aphasia. Although most cases attempt to exclude micro-metastasis, it is likely that some cases of paraneoplastic aphasia are actually extremely small metastasis to the vocal motor regions.

Neurodegenerative disorders may present with aphasia. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease may present with either fluent aphasia or expressive aphasia. There are case reports of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with expressive aphasia.

==Diagnosis==
Expressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia. Diagnosis is done on a case-by-case basis, as lesions often affect the surrounding cortex and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.

A physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. Routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. The physician will complete a brief assessment of the patient&#x27;s ability to understand and produce language. For further diagnostic testing, the physician will refer the patient to a speech-language pathologist, who will complete a comprehensive evaluation.

In order to diagnose a patient with Broca&#x27;s aphasia, there are certain commonly used tests and procedures. The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) classifies individuals based on their scores on the subtests; spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) can inform users what specific type of aphasia they may have, infer the location of lesion, and assess current language abilities. The Porch Index of Communication Ability (PICA) can predict potential recovery outcomes of the patients with aphasia. Quality of life measurement is also an important assessment tool. Tests such as the Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) allow for therapists to target skills that are important and meaningful for the individual.

In addition to formal assessments, patient and family interviews are valid and important sources of information. The patient&#x27;s previous hobbies, interests, personality, and occupation are all factors that will not only impact therapy but may motivate them throughout the recovery process. Patient interviews and observations allow professionals to learn the priorities of the patient and family and determine what the patient hopes to regain in therapy. Observations of the patient may also be beneficial to determine where to begin treatment. The current behaviors and interactions of the patient will provide the therapist with more insight about the client and their individual needs. Other information about the patient can be retrieved from medical records, patient referrals from physicians, and the nursing staff.

In non-speaking patients who use manual languages, diagnosis is often based on interviews from the patient&#x27;s acquaintances, noting the differences in sign production pre- and post-damage to the brain. Many of these patients will also begin to rely on non-linguistic gestures to communicate, rather than signing since their language production is hindered.

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no standard treatment for expressive aphasia. Most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient&#x27;s condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. Patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.

In the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. Among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases. Mechanisms are also taught in traditional treatment to compensate for lost language function such as drawing and using phrases that are easier to pronounce.

Emphasis is placed on establishing a basis for communication with family and caregivers in everyday life. Treatment is individualized based on the patient&#x27;s own priorities, along with the family&#x27;s input.

A patient may have the option of individual or group treatment. Although less common, group treatment has been shown to have advantageous outcomes. Some types of group treatments include family counseling, maintenance groups, support groups and treatment groups.

===Augmentative and Alternative Communication===

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to a set of tools and strategies that support or replace verbal communication for individuals with communication disorders, such as Broca&#x27;s aphasia or other conditions that affect speech and language abilities. AAC is designed to enhance communication and may be used as a temporary or permanent solution, depending on the individual&#x27;s needs. Here are some key aspects of AAC:

# Communication Aids:
#* Low-Tech AAC: This includes simple, non-electronic communication aids such as communication boards, picture books, or communication charts. Users can point to or select symbols or pictures to convey their messages
#* High-Tech AAC: Involves electronic devices such as speech-generating devices (SGDs) or tablet-based communication apps. These devices use synthesized speech or recorded messages to facilitate communication. Users can select words, phrases, or symbols on a screen to express themselves.
# Symbols and Representations:
#* Symbols used in AAC can vary and may include pictures, icons, words, or a combination of these. Symbols are chosen based on the individual&#x27;s cognitive and language abilities.
# Types of AAC Systems:
#* Unaided AAC: Relies on the user&#x27;s body to convey messages without external tools, such as using gestures, facial expressions, or sign language.
#* Aided AAC: Involves external tools or devices, such as communication boards, speech-generating devices, or computer-based systems.
# Vocabulary and Language Systems:
#* Core Vocabulary: Focuses on essential words that are frequently used across various contexts. Core vocabulary systems aim to provide users with a versatile set of words to express a wide range of messages.
#* Fringe Vocabulary: Includes specific words related to an individual&#x27;s unique needs, interests, or daily activities. Fringe vocabulary supplements core vocabulary to make communication more personalized.
# Customization and Individualization:
#* AAC systems are highly customizable to meet the unique needs of each user. Therapists work with individuals and their families to tailor the system to the user&#x27;s abilities, preferences, and communication goals.
# Training and Support:
#* Users of AAC systems, as well as their caregivers and support networks, receive training to effectively use the communication tools. Training may involve learning how to navigate electronic devices, program personalized messages, or understand the meaning of symbols.
# Integration with Therapy:
#* AAC is often integrated into speech and language therapy sessions. Therapists use AAC tools to facilitate communication practice and help individuals with communication disorders improve their language skills.
# Social and Emotional Aspects:
#* AAC not only addresses the functional aspects of communication but also considers the social and emotional dimensions. It plays a crucial role in helping individuals with communication disorders participate more fully in social interactions and express their thoughts and feelings.

AAC is a dynamic and evolving field, and advancements in technology continue to enhance the range and effectiveness of communication tools available for individuals with speech and language challenges. The selection of AAC strategies depends on factors such as the individual&#x27;s abilities, preferences, and the specific nature of their communication disorder.

===Melodic intonation therapy===
Melodic intonation therapy was inspired by the observation that individuals with non-fluent aphasia sometimes can sing words or phrases that they normally cannot speak. &quot;Melodic Intonation Therapy was begun as an attempt to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere in those with aphasia to help cue retrieval words and expressive language.&quot; It is believed that this is because singing capabilities are stored in the right hemisphere of the brain, which is likely to remain unaffected after a stroke in the left hemisphere. However, recent evidence demonstrates that the capability of individuals with aphasia to sing entire pieces of text may actually result from rhythmic features and the familiarity with the lyrics.

The goal of Melodic Intonation Therapy is to utilize singing to access the language-capable regions in the right hemisphere and use these regions to compensate for lost function in the left hemisphere. The natural musical component of speech was used to engage the patients&#x27; ability to produce phrases. A clinical study revealed that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech. Moreover, evidence from randomized controlled trials is still needed to confirm that Melodic Intonation Therapy is suitable to improve propositional utterances and speech intelligibility in individuals with (chronic) non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.

Melodic Intonation Therapy appears to work particularly well in patients who have had a unilateral, left hemisphere stroke, show poor articulation, are non-fluent or have severely restricted speech output, have moderately preserved auditory comprehension, and show good motivation. MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as &quot;water&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot;) are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.

FMRI studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere. The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as &quot;thank you&quot;, &quot;how are you?&quot; or &quot;I am fine.&quot; This type of phrases falls into the category of formulaic language and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.

A pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted and the study reported benefits of utilizing modified MIT treatment early in the recovery phase for people with nonfluent aphasia.

Melodic Intonation Therapy is used by music therapists, board-certified professionals that use music as a therapeutic tool to effect certain non-musical outcomes in their patients. Speech language pathologists can also use this therapy for individuals who have had a left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasias such as Broca&#x27;s or even apraxia of speech.

===Constraint-induced therapy===
Constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) is based on similar principles as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by Dr. Edward Taub at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Constraint-induced movement therapy is based on the idea that a person with an impairment (physical or communicative) develops a &quot;learned nonuse&quot; by compensating for the lost function with other means such as using an unaffected limb by a paralyzed individual or drawing by a patient with aphasia. In constraint-induced movement therapy, the alternative limb is constrained with a glove or sling and the patient is forced to use the affected limb. In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players&#x27; cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (&quot;constrained&quot;) to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.

Two important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions. These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain. Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.

It is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased neuroplasticity. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.

The strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a &quot;plateau&quot; period of recovery. It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term. However, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy. Recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.

===Medication===
In addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia. This area of study is relatively new and much research continues to be conducted.

The following drugs have been suggested for use in treating aphasia and their efficacy has been studied in control studies.
* Bromocriptine – acts on Catecholamine Systems
* Piracetam – mechanism not fully understood, but most likely interacts with cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors, among others
* Cholinergic drugs (Donepezil, Aniracetam, Bifemelane) – acts on acetylcholine systems
* Dopaminergic psychostimulants: (Dexamphetamine, Methylphenidate)

The most effect has been shown by piracetam and amphetamine, which may increase cerebral plasticity and result in an increased capability to improve language function. It has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.

Bromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone. Furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.

Donepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.

No study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy. Furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery. Comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.

===Transcranial magnetic stimulation===
In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified cortical regions. The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. TMS works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain. By suppressing the inhibition of neurons by external factors, the targeted area of the brain may be reactivated and thereby recruited to compensate for lost function. Research has shown that patients can demonstrate increased object naming ability with regular transcranial magnetic stimulation than patients not receiving TMS. Furthermore, research suggests this improvement is sustained upon the completion of TMS therapy. However, some patients fail to show any significant improvement from TMS which indicates the need for further research of this treatment.

===Treatment of underlying forms===
Described as the linguistic approach to the treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences. Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. &quot;What&quot; and &quot;who&quot; questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. For instance, therapists have used sentences like, &quot;Who is the boy helping?&quot; and &quot;What is the boy fixing?&quot; because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training &quot;who&quot; sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained &quot;who&quot; sentences as well as untrained &quot;what&quot; sentences, and vice versa. Likewise, &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; question types are very closely linked. &quot;What&quot; and &quot;who&quot; questions alter placement of arguments, and &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; sentences move adjunct phrases. Training is in the style of: &quot;The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?&quot; Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.

Results: Patients&#x27; use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others. Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings. Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced. Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy. In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.

===Mechanisms of recovery===
Mechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy. FMRI studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area. It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation. It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a &quot;dead-end&quot; and can lead only to partial recovery.

There is evidence to support that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy. By comparing the length and intensity of various methods of therapies, it was proven that intensity is a better predictor of recovery than the method of therapy used.

==Prognosis==
In most individuals with expressive aphasia, the majority of recovery is seen within the first year following a stroke or injury. The majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter. However, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. Patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. On the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4–8 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.

Numerous factors impact the recovery process and outcomes. Site and extent of lesion greatly impacts recovery. Other factors that may affect prognosis are age, education, gender, and motivation. Occupation, handedness, personality, and emotional state may also be associated with recovery outcomes.

Studies have also found that prognosis of expressive aphasia correlates strongly with the initial severity of impairment. However, it has been seen that continued recovery is possible years after a stroke with effective treatment. Timing and intensity of treatment is another factor that impacts outcomes. Research suggests that even in later stages of recovery, intervention is effective at improving function, as well as, preventing loss of function.

Unlike receptive aphasia, patients with expressive aphasia are aware of their errors in language production. This may further motivate a person with expressive aphasia to progress in treatment, which would affect treatment outcomes. On the other hand, awareness of impairment may lead to higher levels of frustration, depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal, which have been proven to negatively affect a person&#x27;s chance of recovery.

==History==
Expressive aphasia was first identified by the French neurologist Paul Broca. By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca&#x27;s discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain&#x27;s loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth&#x27;s loss of ability to produce words.

The discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist Carl Wernicke, who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as Wernicke&#x27;s area. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and receptive aphasia).

<doc id="9843" wikidata="Q47611" url="?curid=9843" title="Ephesus">
<text>Ephesus (; ; ; may ultimately derive from ) was a city in Ancient Greece on the coast of Ionia, southwest of present-day Selçuk in İzmir Province, Turkey. It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of Apasa, the former Arzawan capital, by Attic and Ionian Greek colonists. During the Classical Greek era, it was one of twelve cities that were members of the Ionian League. The city came under the control of the Roman Republic in 129 BC.

The city was famous in its day for the nearby Temple of Artemis (completed around 550 BC), which has been designated one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Its many monumental buildings included the Library of Celsus and a theatre capable of holding 24,000 spectators.

Ephesus was a recipient city of one of the Pauline epistles and one of the seven churches of Asia addressed in the Book of Revelation. The Gospel of John may have been written there, and it was the site of several 5th-century Christian Councils (Council of Ephesus). The city was destroyed by the Goths in 263. Although it was afterwards rebuilt, its importance as a port and commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the Küçükmenderes River. In 614, it was partially destroyed by an earthquake.

Today, the ruins of Ephesus are a favourite international and local tourist attraction, being accessible from Adnan Menderes Airport and from the resort town Kuşadası. In 2015, the ruins were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==

=== Neolithic age ===
Humans had begun inhabiting the area surrounding Ephesus by the Neolithic Age (about 6000 BC), as shown by evidence from excavations at the nearby &quot;höyük&quot; (artificial mounds known as tells) of Arvalya and Cukurici.

=== Bronze Age ===
====Early Bronze====
Excavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early Bronze Age at Ayasuluk Hill.

====Late Bronze====
According to Hittite sources, the capital of the kingdom of Arzawa (another independent state in Western and Southern Anatolia/Asia Minor) was Apasa (or &quot;Abasa&quot;), and some scholars suggest that this is the same place the Greeks later called Ephesus. In 1954, a burial ground from the Mycenaean era (1500–1400 BC), which contained ceramic pots, was discovered close to the ruins of the basilica of St. John. This was the period of the Mycenaean expansion, when the &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; began settling in Asia Minor, a process that continued into the 13th century BC. The names &quot;Apasa&quot; and &quot;Ephesus&quot; appear to be cognate, and recently found inscriptions seem to pinpoint the places in the Hittite record.

===Iron Age===
====Greek migration====

Ephesus was founded as an Attic-Ionian colony in the 10th century BC on a hill (now known as the Ayasuluk Hill), three kilometers () from the centre of ancient Ephesus (as attested by excavations at the Seljuk castle during the 1990s). The mythical founder of the city was a prince of Athens named Androklos, who had to leave his country after the death of his father, King Kodros. According to the legend, he founded Ephesus on the place where the oracle of Delphi became reality (&quot;A fish and a boar will show you the way&quot;). He was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of Ionia together into the Ionian League. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of Priene, another city of the Ionian League. Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century. Later, Greek historians such as Pausanias, Strabo and Herodotos and the poet Kallinos reassigned the city&#x27;s mythological foundation to Ephos, queen of the Amazons.

The Greek goddess Artemis and the great Anatolian goddess Kybele were identified together as &quot;Artemis of Ephesus&quot;. The many-breasted &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot;, identified with Artemis, was venerated in the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the World and the largest building of the ancient world according to Pausanias (4.31.8). Pausanias mentions that the temple was built by Ephesus, son of the river god Caystrus, before the arrival of the Ionians. Of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.

Ancient sources seem to indicate that an older name of the place was Alope ().

==== Archaic period ====

Ephesus became an important ally to the kingdom of Lydia because, like other Ionian cities, it had a port that provided land locked Lydia with trade. Hence, its rulers were connected with the Mermnad dynasty by marriage. Melas the Elder was the brother-in-law of Gyges (680-652 BC), while his grandson Miletus married the daughter of Ardys in the late 7th c. BC. This may explain why in 640 BC, Ephesus and the sanctuary of Artemis were raided, following Sardis, by the Cimmerians, a warlike people who had destroyed the kingdom of Phrygia in central Anatolia decades before. Pythagoras became a tyrant towards the late 7th century BC and adopted an anti-aristocratic policy. Melas the Younger must have succeeded him in power, while his son Pindar was a tyrant when his uncle Croesus ascended to the Lydian throne. In the conflict over the Lydian throne Pindar took the side of Croesus’ half-brother Pantaleon.

Croesus besieged the city, but the Ephesians connected the walls with a rope extending to the sacred Artemisium and thus were spared. Consequently, Pindar was exiled and Ephesus made peace with Lydia, while Croesus is said to have regretted the sacrilege and thus became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of Artemis. 

Later in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus went to war against Persia, which had recently conquered the Median Kingdom. The Ionians refused a peace offer from Cyrus the Great, siding with the Lydians instead. After the Persians defeated Croesus, the Ionians offered to make peace, but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire. They were defeated by the Persian army commander Harpagos in 547 BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the Achaemenid Empire. Those cities were then ruled by satraps.

Ephesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the Archaic Period there is no definite location for the settlement. There are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the Bronze Age and the Roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbours as well as the movement of the Kayster River meant that the location never remained the same.

=== Classical period ===

Ephesus continued to prosper, but when taxes were raised under Cambyses II and Darius, the Ephesians participated in the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule in the Battle of Ephesus (498 BC), an event which instigated the Greco-Persian wars. In 479 BC, the Ionians, together with Athens, were able to oust the Persians from the shores of Asia Minor. In 478 BC, the Ionian cities with Athens entered into the Delian League against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support.

During the Peloponnesian War, Ephesus was first allied to Athens but in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, sided with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, rule over the cities of Ionia was ceded again to Persia.

These wars did not greatly affect daily life in Ephesus. The Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations: they allowed strangers to integrate and education was valued. In later times, Pliny the Elder mentioned having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess Diana by Timarete, the daughter of a painter.

In 356 BC the temple of Artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called Herostratus. The inhabitants of Ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.

=== Hellenistic period ===

When Alexander the Great defeated the Persian forces at the Battle of Granicus in 334 BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and Alexander was greeted warmly when he entered Ephesus in triumph. When Alexander saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Ephesus in 290 BC came under the rule of one of Alexander&#x27;s generals, Lysimachus.

As the river Cayster (Grk. name Κάϋστρος) silted up the old harbour, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. Lysimachus forced the people to move from the ancient settlement around the temple of Artemis to the present site two kilometres () away, when as a last resort the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers. The new settlement was officially called &quot;Arsinoea&quot; ( or Ἀρσινοΐα) or Arsinoe (Ἀρσινόη), after the king&#x27;s second wife, Arsinoe II of Egypt. After Lysimachus had destroyed the nearby cities of Lebedos and Colophon in 292 BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.

Ephesus revolted after the treacherous death of Agathocles, giving the Hellenistic king of Syria and Mesopotamia Seleucus I Nicator an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. After the death of Lysimachus the town again was named Ephesus.

Thus Ephesus became part of the Seleucid Empire. After the murder of king Antiochus II Theos and his Egyptian wife in 246 BC, pharaoh Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus was betrayed by its governor Sophron into the hands of the Ptolemies who ruled the city for half a century until 197 BC.

The Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor and recaptured Ephesus in 196 BC but he then came into conflict with Rome. After a series of battles, he was defeated by Scipio Asiaticus at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. As a result of the subsequent Treaty of Apamea, Ephesus came under the rule of Eumenes II, the Attalid king of Pergamon, (ruled 197–159 BC). When his grandson Attalus III died in 133 BC without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the Roman Republic, on condition that the city of Pergamon be kept free and autonomous.

=== Classical Roman period (129 BC–395 AD) ===

Ephesus, as part of the kingdom of Pergamon, became a subject of the Roman Republic in 129 BC after the revolt of Eumenes III was suppressed.

The city felt Roman influence at once; taxes rose considerably, and the treasures of the city were systematically plundered. Hence in 88 BC Ephesus welcomed Archelaus, a general of Mithridates, king of Pontus, when he conquered Asia (the Roman name for western Anatolia). From Ephesus, Mithridates ordered every Roman citizen in the province to be killed which led to the Asiatic Vespers, the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus, and statues and monument of Roman citizens in Ephesus were also destroyed. But when they saw how badly the people of Chios had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit Philopoemen, the father of Monime, the favourite wife of Mithridates, and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the First Mithridatic War by the Roman consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Ephesus came back under Roman rule in 86 BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.

King Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt retired to Ephesus in 57 BC, passing his time in the sanctuary of the temple of Artemis when the Roman Senate failed to restore him to his throne.

Mark Antony was welcomed by Ephesus for periods when he was proconsul and in 33 BC with Cleopatra when he gathered his fleet of 800 ships before the battle of Actium with Octavius.

When Augustus became emperor in 27 BC, the most important change was when he made Ephesus the capital of proconsular Asia (which covered western Asia Minor) instead of Pergamum. Ephesus then entered an era of prosperity, becoming both the seat of the governor and a major centre of commerce. According to Strabo, it was second in importance and size only to Rome.

The city and temple were destroyed by the Goths in 263 AD. This marked the decline of the city&#x27;s splendour. However, emperor Constantine the Great rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths.

====The Roman population====

Until recently, the population of Ephesus in Roman times was estimated to number up to 225,000 people by Broughton. More recent scholarship regards these estimates as unrealistic. Such a large estimate would require population densities seen in only a few ancient cities, or extensive settlement outside the city walls. This would have been impossible at Ephesus because of the mountain ranges, coastline and quarries which surrounded the city.

The wall of Lysimachus has been estimated to enclose an area of . Not all of this area was inhabited due to public buildings and spaces in the city center and the steep slope of the Bülbül Dağı mountain, which was enclosed by the wall. Ludwig Burchner estimated this area with the walls at 1000 acres. Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor uses an estimate of 345 hectares for the inhabited land or 835 acres (Murphey cites Ludwig Burchner). He cites Josiah Russell using 832 acres and Old Jerusalem in 1918 as the yardstick estimated the population at 51,068 at 148.5 persons per hectare. Using 510 persons per hectare, he arrives at a population between 138,000 and 172,500 . J.W. Hanson estimated the inhabited space to be smaller, at . He argues that population densities of 150~250 people per hectare are more realistic, which gives a range of 33,600–56,000 inhabitants. Even with these much lower population estimates, Ephesus was one of the largest cities of Roman Asia Minor, ranking it as the largest city after Sardis and Alexandria Troas. Hanson and Ortman (2017) estimate an inhabited area to be 263 hectares and their demographic model yields an estimate of 71,587 inhabitants, with a population density of 276 inhabitants per hectare. By contrast, Rome within the walls encompassed 1,500 hectares and as over 400 built-up hectares were left outside the Aurelian Wall, whose construction was begun in 274 AD and finished in 279 AD, the total inhabited area plus public spaces inside the walls consisted of ca. 1,900 hectares. Imperial Rome had a population estimated to be between 750,000 and one million (Hanson and Ortman&#x27;s (2017) model yields an estimate of 923,406 inhabitants), which imply in a population density of 395 to 526 inhabitants per hectare, including public spaces.

=== Byzantine Roman period (395–1308) ===

Ephesus remained the most important city of the Byzantine Empire in Asia after Constantinople in the 5th and 6th centuries. Emperor Flavius Arcadius raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. The basilica of St. John was built during the reign of emperor Justinian I in the 6th century.

Excavations in 2022 indicate that large parts of the city were destroyed in 614/615 by a military conflict, most likely during the Sasanian War, which initiated a drastic decline in the city&#x27;s population and standard of living.

The importance of the city as a commercial centre further declined as the harbour, today 5 kilometres inland, was slowly silted up by the river (today, Küçük Menderes) despite repeated dredging during the city&#x27;s history. The loss of its harbour caused Ephesus to lose its access to the Aegean Sea, which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.

Sackings by the Arabs first in the year 654–655 by caliph Muawiyah I, and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.

When the Seljuk Turks conquered Ephesus in 1090, it was a small village. The Byzantines resumed control in 1097 and changed the name of the town to Hagios Theologos. Crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called Ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. Even the temple of Artemis was completely forgotten by the local population. 

The Crusaders of the Second Crusade fought the Seljuks just outside the town in December 1147. In 1206, the city came under the control of the Laskaris. It was an important religious and intellectual center during the 13th century. Nikephoros Blemmydes, a prominent intellectual of the time, taught in the city. However, the Byzantines lost control of the region by 1308.

=== Pre-Ottoman period (1304–1390) ===
On 24 October 1304, the town surrendered to Sasa Bey, a Turkish warlord of the Menteşoğulları principality. Contrary to the terms of the surrender, the Turks pillaged the church of Saint John and, when a revolt seemed probable, deported most of the local population to Thyrea, Greece. During these events, many of the remaining inhabitants were massacred.

Shortly afterwards, Ephesus was ceded to the Aydinid principality that stationed a powerful navy in the harbour of Ayasuluğ (the present-day Selçuk, next to Ephesus). Ayasoluk became an important harbour, from which piratical raids on the surrounding Christian regions were organised, some officially sanctioned by the state and some by private parties.

The town knew a short period of prosperity again during the 14th century under these new Seljuk rulers. They added important architectural works such as the İsa Bey Mosque, caravansaries, and hamams (bathhouses).
=== Ottoman period ===

Ephesians were incorporated as vassals into the Ottoman Empire for the first time in 1390. The Central Asian warlord Tamerlane defeated the Ottomans in Anatolia in 1402, and the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I died in captivity. The region was restored to the Anatolian beyliks. After a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1425.

Ephesus was completely abandoned by the 15th century. Nearby Ayasuluğ (&quot;Ayasoluk&quot; being a corrupted form of the original Greek name) was turkified to Selçuk in 1914.

==Ephesus and Christianity==

Ephesus was an important centre for Early Christianity from the AD 50s. From AD 52–54, the apostle Paul lived for three years in Ephesus, working with the congregation and organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands. Initially, according to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul attended the Jewish synagogue in Ephesus, but after three months he became frustrated with the stubbornness of some of the Jews, and moved his base to the school of Tyrannus. The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary reminds readers that the unbelief of &quot;some&quot; () implies that &quot;others, probably a large number, believed&quot; and therefore there must have been a community of Jewish Christians in Ephesus. Paul introduced about twelve men to the &#x27;baptism with the Holy Spirit&#x27; who had previously only experienced the baptism of John the Baptist. Later a silversmith named Demetrios stirred up a mob against Paul, saying that he was endangering the livelihood of those making silver Artemis shrines. Demetrios in connection with the temple of Artemis mentions some object (perhaps an image or a stone) &quot;fallen from Zeus&quot;. Between 53 and 57 AD Paul wrote the letter 1 Corinthians from Ephesus (possibly from the &#x27;Paul tower&#x27; near the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). Later, Paul wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians while he was in prison in Rome (around 62 AD).

Roman Asia was also associated with John, one of the chief apostles, and the Gospel of John might have been written in Ephesus, &quot;c&quot; 90–100. John is said to have died of natural causes at Ephesus sometime after AD 98, during the reign of Trajan, thus becoming the only apostle who did not die as a martyr. His tomb is thought to be located in the former Basilica of St. John at Selçuk, a small town in the vicinity of Ephesus. Ephesus was one of the seven cities addressed in the Book of Revelation, indicating that the church at Ephesus was strong.

According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Saint Timothy, the companion of Saint Paul, was the first bishop of Ephesus.

In the early 2nd century, the church at Ephesus was still important enough to be addressed by a letter written by Bishop Ignatius of Antioch to the Ephesians which begins with &quot;Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God the Father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory&quot; (&quot;Letter to the Ephesians&quot;). The church at Ephesus had given their support for Ignatius, who was taken to Rome for execution.

Polycrates of Ephesus () was a bishop at the Church of Ephesus in the 2nd century. He is best known for his letter addressed to the Pope Victor I, Bishop of Rome, defending the Quartodeciman position in the Easter controversy.
A legend, which was first mentioned by Epiphanius of Salamis in the 4th century, purported that 
Mary, the mother of Jesus, may have spent the last years of her life in Ephesus. The Ephesians derived the argument from John&#x27;s presence in the city, and Jesus&#x27; instructions to John to take care of his mother, Mary, after his death. Epiphanius, however, was keen to point out that, while the Bible says John was leaving for Asia, it does not say specifically that Mary went with him. He later stated that she was buried in Jerusalem. Since the 19th century, The House of the Virgin Mary, about from Selçuk, has been considered to have been the last home of Mary, mother of Jesus, before her assumption into heaven in the Roman Catholic tradition, based on the visions of Augustinian sister the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774–1824). It is a popular place of Catholic pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent popes.

The Church of Mary near the harbour of Ephesus was the setting for the Third Ecumenical Council in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of Nestorius. A Second Council of Ephesus was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the Catholics. It came to be called the &quot;Robber Council of Ephesus&quot; or &quot;Robber Synod of Latrocinium&quot; by its opponents.

=== Seven Sleepers ===
Ephesus is believed to be the city of the Seven Sleepers, who were persecuted by the Roman emperor Decius because of their Christianity, and they slept in a cave for three centuries, outlasting their persecution.

They are considered saints by Catholics and Orthodox Christians and their story is also mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an.

== Main sites ==

Ephesus is one of the largest Roman archaeological sites in the eastern Mediterranean. The visible ruins still give some idea of the city&#x27;s original splendour, and the names associated with the ruins are evocative of its former life. The theatre dominates the view down Harbour Street, which leads to the silted-up harbour.

The Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, once stood 418&#x27; by 239&#x27; with over 100 marble pillars each 56&#x27; high. The temple earned the city the title &quot;Servant of the Goddess&quot;. Pliny tells us that the magnificent structure took 120 years to build, but it is now represented only by one inconspicuous column, revealed during an archaeological excavation by the British Museum in the 1870s. Some fragments of the frieze (which are insufficient to suggest the form of the original) and other small finds were removed – some to London and some to the İstanbul Archaeology Museums.
The Library of Celsus, the façade of which has been carefully reconstructed from original pieces, was originally built in memory of Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, an Ancient Greek who served as governor of Roman Asia (105–107 AD) in the Roman Empire. Celsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth and is buried in a sarcophagus beneath it. The library was mostly built by his son Gaius Julius Aquila and once held nearly 12,000 scrolls. Designed with an exaggerated entrance — so as to enhance its perceived size, speculate many historians — the building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.

The interior of the library measured roughly and may have contained as many as 12,000 scrolls. By the year 400 A.D. the library was no longer in use after being damaged in 262 A.D. The facade was reconstructed during 1970 to 1978 using fragments found on site or copies of fragments that were previously removed to museums.

At an estimated 25,000 seating capacity, the theatre is believed to be the largest in the ancient world. This open-air theatre was used initially for drama, but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage; the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard was found in May 2007.

There were two agoras, one for commercial and one for state business.
Ephesus also had several major bath complexes, built at various times while the city was under Roman rule.

The city had one of the most advanced aqueduct systems in the ancient world, with at least six aqueducts of various sizes supplying different areas of the city. They fed a number of water mills, one of which has been identified as a sawmill for marble.

The Odeon was a small roofed theatre constructed by Publius Vedius Antoninus and his wife around 150 AD. It was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. There were 22 stairs in the theatre. The upper part of the theatre was decorated with red granite pillars in the Corinthian style. The entrances were at both sides of the stage and reached by a few steps.
The Temple of Hadrian dates from the 2nd century but underwent repairs in the 4th century and has been reerected from the surviving architectural fragments. The reliefs in the upper sections are casts, the originals now being exhibited in the Ephesus Archaeological Museum. A number of figures are depicted in the reliefs, including the emperor Theodosius I with his wife and eldest son. The temple was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 20 million lira banknote of 2001–2005 and of the 20 new lira banknote of 2005–2009.

The Temple of the Sebastoi (sometimes called the Temple of Domitian), dedicated to the Flavian dynasty, was one of the largest temples in the city. It was erected on a pseudodipteral plan with 8 × 13 columns. The temple and its statue are some of the few remains connected with Domitian.

The Tomb/Fountain of Pollio was erected in 97 AD in honour of C. Sextilius Pollio, who constructed the Marnas aqueduct, by Offilius Proculus. It has a concave façade.

A part of the site, Basilica of St. John, was built in the 6th century, under emperor Justinian I, over the supposed site of the apostle&#x27;s tomb. It is now surrounded by Selçuk.

== Archaeology ==
The history of archaeological research in Ephesus stretches back to 1863, when British architect John Turtle Wood, sponsored by the British Museum, began to search for the Artemision. In 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. In 1895 German archaeologist Otto Benndorf, financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by Austrian Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof, resumed excavations. In 1898 Benndorf founded the Austrian Archaeological Institute, which plays a leading role in Ephesus today.

Finds from the site are exhibited notably in the Ephesos Museum in Vienna, the Ephesus Archaeological Museum in Selçuk and in the British Museum.

In October 2016, Turkey halted the works of the archeologists, which had been ongoing for more than 100 years, due to tensions between Austria and Turkey. In May 2018, Turkey allowed Austrian archeologists to resume their excavations.

<text>JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

== History ==
=== Creation at Netscape ===
The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.

The goal was a &quot;language for the masses&quot;, &quot;to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites&quot;. Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.

The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.

=== Adoption by Microsoft ===
Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.

Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of &quot;best viewed in Netscape&quot; and &quot;best viewed in Internet Explorer&quot; logos for several years.

=== The rise of JScript ===
In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.

However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer&#x27;s market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.

=== Growth and standardization ===
During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.

In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.

Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.

Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.

In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.

=== Reaching maturity ===
Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.

The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system. As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.

The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.

The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.

== Trademark ==
&quot;JavaScript&quot; is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.

A letter was circulated in September 2024, spearheaded by Ryan Dahl, calling on Oracle to free the JavaScript trademark. Brendan Eich, the original creator of JavaScript, was among the over 14,000 signatories who supported the initiative.

== Website client-side usage ==
JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.

All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user&#x27;s device.

=== Examples of scripted behavior ===
* Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
* Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.
* Playing browser games.
* Controlling the playback of streaming media.
* Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.
* Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.
* Logging data about the user&#x27;s behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
*Redirecting a user to another page.
* Storing and retrieving data on the user&#x27;s device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.

=== Libraries and frameworks ===
Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.

jQuery is by far the most-used. Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash, Modernizr, React, Underscore, and Vue. Multiple options can be used in conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.

However, the term &quot;Vanilla JS&quot; was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.

== Other usage ==
The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.

Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.

Oracle used to provide Nashorn, a JavaScript interpreter, as part of their Java Development Kit (JDK) API library along with jjs a command line interpreter as of JDK version 8. It was removed in JDK 15. As a replacement Oracle offered GraalJS which can also be used with the OpenJDK which allows one to create and reference Java objects in JavaScript code and add runtime scripting in JavaScript to applications written in Java. 

JavaScript has been used in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.

== Execution ==
=== JavaScript engine ===
=== Runtime system ===
A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and provides the ability to import scripts.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and it calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function&#x27;s arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function&#x27;s needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as &quot;run to completion&quot; because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language&#x27;s concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.

The notable standalone runtimes are Node.js, Deno, and Bun.

== Features ==
The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.

=== Imperative and structured ===
JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., codice_1 statements, codice_2 loops, codice_3 statements, codice_4 loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with codice_5; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords codice_6 and codice_7. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.

=== Weakly typed ===
JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.

* The binary codice_8 operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator
* The binary codice_9 operator always casts both operands to a number
* Both unary operators (codice_8, codice_9) always cast the operand to a number. However, codice_8 always casts to codice_13 (binary64) while codice_9 preserves codice_15 (integer)

Values are cast to strings like the following:

* Strings are left as-is
* Numbers are converted to their string representation
* Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (codice_16)
* Other objects are converted to the string codice_17 where codice_18 is the name of the constructor of the object

Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining codice_19 and codice_20 functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.

JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.

Often also mentioned is codice_21 resulting in codice_22 (number). This is misleading: the codice_23 is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary codice_8 operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - codice_25 – the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is codice_26 as expected.

=== Dynamic ===
==== Typing ====
JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.

==== Run-time evaluation ====

JavaScript includes an codice_27 function that can execute statements provided as strings at run-time.

=== Object-orientation (prototype-based) ===
Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:
In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (codice_28) and bracket notation (codice_29). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object&#x27;s prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a codice_30 loop.

==== Prototypes ====
JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance, but it&#x27;s still possible to simulate most class-based features with the prototype system. Additionally, ECMAScript version 6 (released June 2015) introduced the keywords class, extends and super, which serve as syntactic sugar to abstract the underlying prototypal inheritance system with a more conventional interface. Constructors are declared by specifying a method named constructor, and all classes are automatically subclasses of the base class Object, similarly to Java. 
class Person {
 constructor(name) {
 this.name = name;
}

class Student extends Person {
 constructor(name, id) {
 super(name);
 this.id = id;
}

const bob = new Student(&quot;Robert&quot;, 12345);
console.log(bob.name); // Robert
Though the underlying object mechanism is still based on prototypes, the newer syntax is similar to other object oriented languages. Private variables are declared by prefixing the field name with a number sign (#), and polymorphism is not directly supported, although it can be emulated by manually calling different functions depending on the number and type of arguments provided.

==== Functions as object constructors ====
Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with &quot;new&quot; will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the codice_18 prototype). ECMAScript 5 offers the codice_32 method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the codice_18 prototype (older environments can assign the prototype to codice_34). The constructor&#x27;s codice_35 property determines the object used for the new object&#x27;s internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor.// This code is completely equivalent to the previous snippet
function Person(name) {
 this.name = name;

function Student(name, id) {
 Person.call(this, name);
 this.id = id;

var bob = new Student(&quot;Robert&quot;, 12345);
console.log(bob.name); // RobertJavaScript&#x27;s built-in classes, such as codice_36 and codice_18, also have prototypes that can be modified. However, it&#x27;s generally considered bad practice to modify built-in objects, because third-party code may use or inherit methods and properties from these objects, and may not expect the prototype to be modified.

==== Functions as methods ====

Unlike in many object-oriented languages, in JavaScript there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling. When a function is called as a method of an object, the function&#x27;s local &quot;this&quot; keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.

=== Functional ===
JavaScript functions are first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as codice_38 and codice_39.

==== Lexical closure ====
A &quot;nested&quot; function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked.

In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes.

==== Anonymous function ====
JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.

=== Delegative ===

JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.

==== Functions as roles (Traits and Mixins) ====
JavaScript natively supports various function-based implementations of Role patterns like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the codice_40 keyword within its codice_41 body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via codice_42 or codice_43 to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.

==== Object composition and inheritance ====
Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object&#x27;s context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.

=== Miscellaneous ===
==== Zero-based numbering ====
JavaScript is a zero-index language.

==== Variadic functions ====

An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local codice_44 object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the codice_45 method.

==== Array and object literals ====
Like in many scripting languages, arrays and objects (associative arrays in other languages) can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.

==== Regular expressions ====
In a manner similar to Perl, JavaScript also supports regular expressions, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.

==== Promises and Async/await ====
JavaScript supports promises and Async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

===== Promises =====
A built-in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action&#x27;s eventual result. Recently, the JavaScript specification introduced combinator methods, which allow developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any.

===== Async/await =====
Async/await allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non-blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similarly to traditional synchronous, blocking code.

=== Vendor-specific extensions ===
Historically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:
* array comprehensions and generator expressions (like Python)
* concise function expressions (codice_46; this experimental syntax predated arrow functions)
* ECMAScript for XML (E4X), an extension that adds native XML support to ECMAScript (unsupported in Firefox since version 21)

== Syntax ==

Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the codice_5, codice_6 or codice_49 keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope.

Arrow functions were first introduced in . They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous, so a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation, unless surrounded by parenthesis and executed immediately.

Here is an example of JavaScript syntax.

// Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the
// special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically
// set to undefined.
// var is generally considered bad practice and let and const are usually preferred.
var x;

// Variables can be manually set to `undefined` like so
let x2 = undefined;

// Declares a block-scoped variable named `y`, and implicitly sets it to
// `undefined`. The `let` keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
let y;

// Declares a block-scoped, un-reassignable variable named `z`, and sets it to
// a string literal. The `const` keyword was also introduced in ECMAScript 2015,
// and must be explicitly assigned to.

// The keyword `const` means constant, hence the variable cannot be reassigned
// as the value is `constant`.
const z = &quot;this value cannot be reassigned!&quot;;

// Declares a global-scoped variable and assigns 3. This is generally considered
// bad practice, and will not work if strict mode is on.
t = 3;

// Declares a variable named `myNumber`, and assigns a number literal (the value
// `2`) to it.
let myNumber = 2;

// Reassigns `myNumber`, setting it to a string literal (the value `&quot;foo&quot;`).
// JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, so this is legal.
myNumber = &quot;foo&quot;;
Note the comments in the examples above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.

== Security ==

JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.

There are subsets of general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.

Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.

=== Cross-site scripting ===
A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim&#x27;s authorization. One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML sanitization.

Some browsers include partial protection against &quot;reflected&quot; XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can fully prevent XSS.

XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.

=== Cross-site request forgery ===
Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker&#x27;s site tricks the victim&#x27;s browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker&#x27;s site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.

&quot;JavaScript hijacking&quot; is a type of CSRF attack in which a codice_50 tag on an attacker&#x27;s site exploits a page on the victim&#x27;s site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:

* requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.

=== Misplaced trust in the client ===
Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The author of an application should not assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:
* Website authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.
* JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.
* Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.
* It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.
* Prototype pollution is a runtime vulnerability in which attackers can overwrite arbitrary properties in an object&#x27;s prototype.

=== Misplaced trust in developers ===
Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program&#x27;s dependencies upon other developers&#x27; program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. &quot;The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.&quot; Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.

=== Browser and plugin coding errors ===

JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user&#x27;s system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system&#x27;s API with superuser privileges.

These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).

In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges. Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own &quot;sandbox&quot;.

=== Sandbox implementation errors ===
Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.

Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript&#x27;s privileges in Internet Explorer.

Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer&#x27;s hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.

=== Hardware vulnerabilities ===
In 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.

In 2017, a JavaScript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It is called &quot;ASLR⊕Cache&quot; or AnC.

In 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.

== Development tools ==
Important tools have evolved with the language.

* Every major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger.
* Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines.
* Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.
* Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.

== Related technologies ==
=== Java ===
A common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java&#x27;s syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript&#x27;s standard library follows Java&#x27;s naming conventions, and JavaScript&#x27;s and objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.

Both languages first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.

The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript&#x27;s typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java&#x27;s objects are class-based, while JavaScript&#x27;s are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.

=== JSON ===
JSON is a data format derived from JavaScript; hence the name JavaScript Object Notation. It is a widely used format supported by many other programming languages.

=== Transpilers ===
Many websites are JavaScript-heavy, so transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.

TypeScript and CoffeeScript are two notable languages that transpile to JavaScript.

=== WebAssembly ===
WebAssembly is a newer language with a bytecode format designed to complement JavaScript, especially the performance-critical portions of web page scripts. All of the major JavaScript engines support WebAssembly, which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.

asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.

<doc id="9855" wikidata="Q188863" url="?curid=9855" title="Exile">
<text>Exile or banishment is primarily penal expulsion from one&#x27;s native country, and secondarily expatriation or prolonged absence from one&#x27;s homeland under either the compulsion of circumstance or the rigors of some high purpose. Usually persons and peoples suffer exile, but sometimes social entities like institutions (e.g. the papacy or a government) are forced from their homeland.

In Roman law, denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject&#x27;s citizenship and property.

The term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced. &quot;Government in exile&quot; describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.&quot;

==Internal exile==

Internal exile is a form of banishment within the boundaries of one&#x27;s homeland, but far away from home.

==For individuals==
===Exiled heads of state===

In some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.

===Avoiding tax or legal matters===

A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a &quot;tax exile&quot;. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this. Examples include the British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;Airport&quot;, and the English rock band the Rolling Stones who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;, the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera. In 2012, Eduardo Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company&#x27;s IPO. The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen&#x27;s decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act, which would have forced such wealthy &quot;tax exiles&quot; to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.

In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for 17 years rather than face prosecution in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company Polly Peck in the United Kingdom.

===Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war===
Examples include:
* Iraqi academics asked to return home &quot;from exile&quot; to help rebuild Iraq in 2009
* People undertaking a religious or civil liberties role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example, in Czechoslovakia, nuns were internally exiled to small villages along the northern border that had been stripped of their original German populations (such as Bílá Voda) following the Communist coup d&#x27;état of 1948.
* Thibaw Min and Supayalat were exiled to India after Third Anglo-Burmese War, named Pataw Mu.

===Euphemism for convict===
Exile, government man and assigned servant were all euphemisms used in the 19th century for convicts under sentence who had been transported from Britain to Australia.

==For groups, nations, and governments==

===Nation in exile===

When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or &quot;diaspora&quot;. Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Israelites by the Assyrian king Sargon II in 720 BCE, the Judeans who were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC, and the Jews following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Land of Israel, such as &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot;.

After the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russia, Prussia and Austria), many Poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of Crimean Tatars (numbering 200,000 in all) that remained in their homeland of Crimea was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing and collective punishment on false accusations.

Since the Cuban Revolution, over a million Cubans have left Cuba. Most of these self-identified as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. At the time of the Cuban Revolution, Cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles&#x27; children also consider themselves to be Cuban exiles. Under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens. An extension of colonial practices, Latin America saw widespread exile, of a political variety, during the 19th and 20th century. Exiled political groups often develop complex media strategies, including diaspora engagement and investigative reporting, to maintain visibility, mobilise support, and address challenges of operating outside their home country.

===Government in exile===

During a foreign occupation or after a coup d&#x27;état, a &quot;government in exile&quot; of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating outside Poland, and the African-based Free French Forces government of Charles de Gaulle during the German Occupation of Poland and France in WWII. Other post-war examples include the client All Palestine Government established by the Egyptian Kingdom, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai Lama.

===For inanimate objects===
Ivan the Terrible once exiled to Siberia an inanimate object: a bell. &quot;When the inhabitants of the town of Uglich rang their bell to rally a demonstration against Ivan the Terrible, the cruel Czar executed two hundred (nobles), and exiled the Uglich bell to Siberia, where it remained for two hundred years.&quot;

==In popular culture==
===Drama===
Exile is an early motif in ancient Greek tragedy. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play &quot;Medea&quot;, written by Euripides in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of Greek mythology. Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot; has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.

===Art===

After Medea was abandoned by Jason and had become a murderess out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king Aigeus there, and became the stepmother of the hero Theseus. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the Polis and go away into exile. John William Waterhouse (1849–1917), the English Pre-Raphaelite painter&#x27;s famous picture &quot;Jason and Medea&quot; shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.

===Literature===
In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanța. There he wrote his famous work &quot;Tristia&quot; (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.
Another, at least in a temporary exile, was Dante.

The German-language writer Franz Kafka described the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel .

During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and Anna Seghers. So Germany&#x27;s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit. Klaus Mann finished his novel (&quot;The Volcano: A Novel Among Emigrants&quot;) in 1939 describing the German exile scene, &quot;to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form&quot;, as he wrote in his literary balance sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel (&quot;The Seventh Cross&quot;, published in the United States in 1942).

Important exile literature in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott as well as the novelists Edwidge Danticat and Sam Selvon.

<text>Elbląg (; ; ) is a city in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, located in the eastern edge of the Żuławy region with 127,390 inhabitants, as of December 2021. It is the capital of Elbląg County.

Elbląg is one of the oldest cities in the province. Its history dates back to 1237, when the Teutonic Order constructed their fortified stronghold on the banks of a nearby river. The castle subsequently served as the official seat of the Teutonic Order Masters.

Elbląg became part of the Hanseatic League, which contributed much to the city&#x27;s wealth. Through the Hanseatic League, the city was linked to other major ports like Gdańsk, Lübeck and Amsterdam. Elbląg joined Poland in 1454 and after the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Thirteen Years’ War was recognized as part of Poland in 1466. It then flourished and turned into a significant trading point, but its growth was eventually hindered by the Second Northern War and the Swedish Deluge.

The city was transferred to Prussia after the first partition of Poland in 1772. Its trading role greatly weakened, until the era of industrialization in the 19th century. It was then that the famous Elbląg Canal was commissioned. A tourist site and important engineering monument, it has been named one of the Seven Wonders of Poland and a Historic Monument of Poland.

After World War II the city again became part of Poland. The war casualties were catastrophic – especially the severe destruction of the Old Town district, one of the grandest in Prussia. The town&#x27;s population hitherto was German-speaking. The people who had not fled or had returned were entirely expelled and new Polish settlers took their place.

Today, Elbląg has over 120,000 inhabitants and is a &quot;vibrant city with an attractive tourist base&quot;. It serves as an academic and financial center and among its numerous historic monuments is the Market Gate from 1309 and St. Nicholas Cathedral. Elbląg is also known for its archaeological sites, museums and the country&#x27;s largest brewery, founded in 1872.

==Etymology==
&quot;Elbląg&quot; derives from the earlier German-language &quot;Elbing&quot;, which is the name by which the Teutonic Knights knew both the river here and the citadel they established on its banks in 1237. The purpose of the citadel was to prevent the Old Prussian settlement of Truso from being reoccupied, the German crusaders being at war with the pagan Prussians. The citadel was named after the river, itself of uncertain etymology. One traditional etymology connects it to the name of the Helveconae, a Germanic tribe mentioned in Ancient Greek and Latin sources, but the etymology or language of the tribal name remains unknown. The oldest known mention of the river or town Elbląg is in the form &quot;Ylfing&quot; in the report of a sailor Wulfstan from the end of the 9th century, in &quot;&quot; which was written in Anglo-Saxon in King Alfred&#x27;s reign.

== Modern city ==
The city was almost completely destroyed at the end of World War II. Parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt, and around 2000 rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture, in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls. The western suburbs of the old city have not been reconstructed.

The modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between Lake Drużno and Elbląg Bay (&quot;Zatoka Elbląska&quot;, an arm of the Vistula Lagoon), and spreads out on both banks, though mainly on the eastern side. To the east is the Elbląg Upland (&quot;Wysoczyzna Elbląska&quot;), a dome pushed up by glacial compression, 390 km2 in diameter and high at its greatest elevation.

Views to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon; this part of the Vistula Delta (&quot;Żuławy Wiślane&quot;) is used mainly for agricultural purposes. To the south are the marshes and swamps of Drużno. The Elbląg River has been left in a more natural state through the city, but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches. One of them, the Jagiellonski Channel (&quot;Kanał Jagielloński&quot;), leads to the Nogat River, along which navigation to Gdańsk is common. The Elbląg Canal (&quot;Kanał Elbląski&quot;) connecting Lake Drużno with Drwęca River and Lake Jeziorak is a tourist site.

== Port of Elbląg ==
Elbląg is not a deep-water port. The draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than by law. The turning area at Elbląg is diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels. Deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, Elbląg has become a subsidiary port of Gdańsk. Traffic of smaller vessels at Elbląg is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels were unable to reach the open Baltic Sea after 1945 without crossing into Russian territory. Construction of the Vistula Spit canal was completed in September 2022, allowing vessels access to the Baltic Sea while remaining within Polish territory. The city features three quay complexes, movable cranes, and railways.

==Geography==

=== Geographical location ===
Elbląg is located about south-east of Gdańsk and south-west of Kaliningrad, Russia.
The city is a port on the river Elbląg, which flows into the Vistula Lagoon about to the north, thus giving the city access to the Baltic Sea via the Russian-controlled Strait of Baltiysk. The Old Town () is located on the river Elbląg connecting Lake Drużno to the Vistula Lagoon, about from the lagoon and from Gdańsk.

===Climate===
The climate of Elbląg is an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), owing to its position of the Baltic Sea, which moderates the temperatures, compared to the interior of Poland. The climate is cool throughout the year and there is a somewhat uniform precipitation throughout the year. Typical of Northern Europe, there is little sunshine during the year.

==History==
===Truso===
The settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Ilfing&quot; in &quot;&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon chronicle written in King Alfred&#x27;s reign using information from a Viking who had visited the area.

During the Middle Ages, the Viking settlement of Truso was located on Lake Drużno, near the current site of Elbląg in historical Pogesania; the settlement burned down in the 10th century. Early in the 13th century the Teutonic Knights conquered the region, built a castle, and founded Elbing on the lake, with a population mostly from Lübeck (today the lake, now much smaller, no longer reaches the city). After the uprising against the Teutonic Knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants, the city successively came under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Poland (1454), the Kingdom of Prussia (1772), and Germany (1871). Elbing was heavily damaged in World War II, and its remaining German citizens were expelled upon the war&#x27;s end in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The city became again part of Poland in 1945 and was repopulated with Polish citizens.
The seaport of Truso was first mentioned by Wulfstan of Hedeby, an Anglo-Saxon sailor, travelling on the south coast of the Baltic Sea at the behest of King Alfred the Great of England. The exact location of Truso was not known for a long time, as the seashore has significantly changed, but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern Elbląg on Lake Drużno. Truso was located at territory already known to the Roman Empire and earlier.

It was an important seaport serving the Vistula River bay on the early medieval Baltic Sea trade routes which led from Birka in the north to the island of Gotland and to Visby in the Baltic Sea. From there, traders continued further south to Carnuntum along the Amber Road. The ancient Amber Road led further southwest and southeast to the Black Sea and eventually to Asia. The east–west trade route went from Truso, along the Baltic Sea to Jutland, and from there inland by river to Hedeby, a large trading center in Jutland. The main goods of Truso were amber, furs, and slaves.

Archaeological finds in 1897 and diggings in the 1920s placed Truso at Gut Hansdorf. A large burial field was also found at Elbląg. Recent Polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about 20 hectares. Many of these artifacts are now displayed at the Muzeum w Elblągu.

=== Prussian Crusade ===

Attempts to conquer Prussian land began in 997, when Bolesław I the Brave, at the urging of the Pope, sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary (Adalbert of Prague) to the pagan Prussians, a non-Slavic people, on a crusade of conquest and conversion. The crusade encompassed much of the Baltic Sea coast east of the Polish city of Gdańsk, up to Sambia. Starting in 1209 additional crusades were called for by Konrad of Masovia, who mainly sought to conquer Prussian territory, rather than actually convert the indigenous Prussians. Despite heroic efforts, Old Prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by Pope Honorius III and his frequent calls for crusade.

Before the Prussians were finally brought to heel, Polish rulers and the Duchy of Masovia, both by then Christianised peoples, would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion. Aside from minor border raids, major campaigns against the Prussians would be launched in 1219, 1220, and 1222. After a particularly sound defeat by Prussian forces in 1223, Polish forces in Chełmno, the seat of Christian of Oliva and the Duchy of Masovia, were forced onto the defensive.

In 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia summoned the Teutonic Knights for assistance; by 1230 they had secured Chełmno (Culm) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the Holy Roman Empire, although these claims were rejected by the Poles, whose ambition had been to conquer Prussia all along. The Teutonic Order&#x27;s strategy was to move down the Vistula and secure the delta, establishing a barrier between the Prussians and Gdańsk. The victorious Teutonic Knights built a castle at Elbing.

The Chronicon terrae Prussiae describes the conflict in the vicinity of Lake Drużno shortly before the founding of Elbing:

:&quot;All the little redoubts that they had in that place, which are said to be (list) ... and around the Drusine marsh ... he (frater Hermannus magister) assaulted and levelled by rendering them into ash, after the infidels had been killed or captured.&quot;

Truso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of Elbing during the Prussian Crusade. It had already burned down in the tenth century, with the population dispersed in the area.

=== Teutonic Order ===
The Chronicon terrae Prussiae describes the founding of Elbing under the leadership of Hermann Balk. After building two ships, the Pilgerim (Pilgrim) and the Vridelant (Friedland), with the assistance of Margrave Henry III of Margraviate of Meissen, the Teutonic Knights used them to clear the Vistula Lagoon (&quot;Frisches Haff&quot;) and the Vistula Spit of Prussians:
:... &quot;and the Vistula Spit was purged of the insult of the infidels...&quot;

Apparently the river was in Pomesania, which the knights had just finished clearing, but the bay was in Pogesania. The first Elbing was placed in Pogesania:

:&quot;The master ... came to the region of Pogesania, to that island which is in the middle of the Elbing river, in that place where the Elbing enters the Vistula Lagoon, and built there a fort, which he called by the name of the Elbing River, in the year of the incarnation of the Lord, 1237. Others report that the same fort was attacked by the infidels and then was moved to the place where it is now situated, and the city gathered around it.&quot;
Both landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships. The &quot;Chronicon&quot; relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in Lake Drużno. In 1238 the Dominican Order was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land. Pomesania was not secured, however, and from 1240 to 1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement. It may be significant that Elbing&#x27;s first industry was the same as Truso&#x27;s had been: manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export. In 1243 William of Modena created the Diocese of Pomesania and three others. They were at first only ideological constructs, but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century.

The foundation of Elbing was perhaps not the end of the Old Prussian story in the region. In 1825 a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the Baltic Old Prussian language, commonly known in English as &quot;Elbing Vocabulary&quot;, was found among some manuscripts from a merchant&#x27;s house. It contained 802 words in a dialect now termed Pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of High German.

The origin of the vocabulary remains unknown. Its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries; i.e., it may have been used by German speakers to communicate with Old Prussians, but the specific circumstances are only speculative. The manuscript became the Codex Neumannianus. It disappeared after a British bombing raid destroyed the library at Elbing but before then facsimiles had been made. The date of the MSS was estimated at ca. 1400, but it was a copy. There is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original, except that it must have been in Pomesanian.
In 1246 the town was granted a constitution under Lübeck law, used in maritime circumstances, instead of Magdeburg rights common in other cities in Central Europe. This decision of the Order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the trade association that in 1358 would become the Hanseatic League. The Order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the Baltic. The Order&#x27;s involvement in the League was somewhat contradictory. In whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town, who kept office in the citadel, typically used as a prison. Lübeck law, on the other hand, provided for self-government of the town.

Membership in the Hanseatic League meant having important trading contacts with England, Flanders, France, and the Netherlands. The city received numerous merchant privileges from the rulers of England, Poland, Pomerania, and the Teutonic Order. For instance, the privilege of the Old Town was upgraded in 1343, while in 1393 it was granted an emporium privilege for grains, metals, and forest products.

Except for the citadel and churches, Elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards. Its area was . It featured a wharf, a marketplace and five streets, as well as a number of churches. The castle was completed in 1251. In 1288 fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches, which were of brick. A new circuit wall was started immediately. From 1315 to 1340 Elbląg was rebuilt. A separate settlement called New Town was founded ca. 1337 and received Lübeck rights in 1347. In 1349 the Black Death struck the town, toward the end of the European plague. After the population recovered it continued building up the city and in 1364 a crane was built for the port.

The German-language &quot;Elbinger Rechtsbuch&quot;, written in Elbing documented among other laws for the first time Polish common law. The German-language Polish laws are based on the Sachsenspiegel and were written down to aid the judges. It is thus the oldest source for documented Polish common law and is in Polish referred to as the &quot;Księga Elbląska&quot; (Book of Elbląg). It was written down in the second half of the 13th century.

In 1410, during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, the inhabitants of the city rebelled against the Teutonic Knights and expelled them, while welcoming Polish troops and paying homage to Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło, who afterwards vested Elbląg with new privileges. As the castle was lightly defended by a Polish garrison, the Teutonic Knights managed to retake it, promising the Polish defenders that they will be given free passage back to Poland. After the castle was taken, the Knights broke their promise and subsequently murdered a number of the captured defenders while imprisoning the rest.

===Kingdom of Poland===

In February 1440, the city hosted a convention at which delegates from various cities (including Elbing itself) and nobility from the region decided to establish the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. In April and May 1440, further meetings were held in Elbing, at which more towns and noblemen joined the organisation. In 1454, the organisation led the revolt against the rule of the Teutonic Knights, and then its delegation submitted a petition to King Casimir IV of Poland asking him to include the region within the Kingdom of Poland. The King agreed and signed the act of incorporation of the region (including Elbing) to the Kingdom of Poland in March 1454 in Kraków, which sparked the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the longest of all Polish–Teutonic wars. The local mayor pledged allegiance to the Polish King during the incorporation in March 1454, and the burghers of Elbląg recognized Casimir IV as rightful ruler. After paying homage to the King, the city was granted great privileges, similar to those of Toruń and Gdańsk. Since 1454, the city was authorized by King Casimir IV to mint Polish coins. The war ended in a Polish victory in 1466, with the Second Peace of Thorn, in which the Teutonic Order renounced any claims to the city and recognised it as part of Poland.

Within the Kingdom of Poland, the city was administratively part of the Malbork Voivodeship in the newly established autonomous province of Royal Prussia, later also within the larger Greater Poland Province. The city was known to the Polish crown by its Polish name Elbląg. With the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, the city was brought under direct control of the Polish crown. As one of the largest and most influential cities of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period in Poland.

Elbląg was often visited by Nicolaus Copernicus between 1504 and 1530.

With the 16th century Protestant Reformation the burghers became Lutherans and the first Lutheran Gymnasium was established in Elbląg in 1535.

From 1579 Elbląg had close trade relations with England, to which the city accorded free trade. English, Scottish, and Irish merchants settled in the city. They formed the Scottish Reformed Church of Elbląg and became Elbląg citizens, aiding Lutheran Sweden in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The rivalry of nearby Gdańsk interrupted trading links several times. By 1618 Elbląg had left the Hanseatic League owing to its close business dealings with England.

Famous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons Hans von Bodeck and Samuel Hartlib. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna brought the Moravian Brethren refugee John Amos Comenius to Elbląg for six years (1642–1648). In 1642 Johann Stobäus, who composed with Johann Eccard, published the &quot; Preussische Fest-Lieder&quot;, a number of evangelical Prussian songs. In 1646 the city recorder Daniel Barholz noted that the city council employed &quot;Bernsteindreher&quot;, or &quot;Paternostermacher&quot;, licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on prayer beads, rosaries, and many other items made of amber. Members of the Barholz family became mayors and councillors.
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Vistula Lagoon was the main southern Baltic base of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who was hailed as the protector of the Protestants. By 1660 the Vistula Lagoon had gone to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, but was returned in 1700.

The poet Christian Wernicke was born in 1661 in Elbląg, while Gottfried Achenwall became famous for his teachings in natural law and human rights law. In 1700–1710 it was occupied by Swedish troops. In 1709 it was besieged, taken by storm on February 2, 1710, by Russian troops with support of Prussian artillery. The city was handed over to Polish King Augustus II in 1712.

The Royal-Polish mathematician and cartographer Johann Friedrich Endersch completed a map of Warmia in 1755 and also made a copper etching of the galley named &quot;The City of Elbing&quot;.

During the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, Elbląg was placed under military occupation by Russia and Saxony. The town came again under occupation by Russia from 1758 to 1762 during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

===Kingdom of Prussia===
During the First Partition of Poland in 1772 Elbląg was annexed by King Frederick the Great of the Kingdom of Prussia. Elbing became part of the newly established province of West Prussia in 1773. In the 1815 provincial reorganization following the Napoleonic Wars, Elbing and its hinterland were included within Regierungsbezirk Danzig in West Prussia.

In October and November 1831, various Polish infantry, cavalry and artillery units, engineer corps and sappers of the November Uprising stopped in the city and its environs on the way to their internment locations, whereas the general staff with Commander-in-Chief General Maciej Rybiński and generals Józef Bem, Marcin Klemensowski, Kazimierz Małachowski, Ludwik Michał Pac and Antoni Wroniecki was interned in the city. On December 22, 1831, the Prussian army attempted to pacify the Polish insurgents and launched a charge on the disarmed Poles, who resisted relocation, fearing deportation to the Russian Partition of Poland. Some insurgents eventually left partitioned Poland for the Great Emigration, including Józef Bem, who was expelled by the Prussians in December 1831, and Maciej Rybiński, who left the city in February 1832.
Elbing industrialized. In 1828 the first steamship was built by Ignatz Grunau. In 1837 Ferdinand Schichau started the Schichau-Werke company in Elbing as well as another shipyard in Danzig (Gdańsk) later on. Schichau constructed the &quot;Borussia&quot;, the first screw-vessel in Germany. Schichau-Werke built hydraulic machinery, ships, steam engines, and torpedoes. After the inauguration of the railway to Königsberg in 1853, Elbing&#x27;s industry began to grow. Schichau worked together with his son-in-law Carl H. Zise, who continued the industrial complex after Schichau&#x27;s death. Schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers.

Georg Steenke, an engineer from Königsberg, connected Elbing near the Baltic Sea with the southern part of Prussia by building the Oberländischer Kanal (Elbląg Canal).

Elbing became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. As Elbing became an industrial city, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) frequently received the majority of votes; in the 1912 Reichstag elections the SPD received 51% of the vote. After World War I, as most of the province of West Prussia was reintegrated with the reborn Polish Republic, Elbing was joined to the German province of East Prussia, and was separated from Weimar Germany by the so-called Polish Corridor.

===Nazi Germany===

During World War II, under Nazi Germany, a Nazi prison, a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag I-A POW camp, a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag XX-B POW camp, and three subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp were operated in the city. The Germans also enslaved Poles as forced labour in the city. The Polish resistance was active and infiltrated the German arms industry. Dozens of Polish resistance members were held in the local prison, and at least 15 were sentenced to death in the city in 1942.

The prison and forced labour camps were closed and many of the German inhabitants forced to flee as the Soviet Red Army approached the city toward the end of the war. Laid under siege since January 23, 1945, about 65% of the city infrastructure was destroyed, including most of the historical city center. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army during the night of February 9/10, 1945. During the first days of the siege most of the population of approximately 100,000 persons fled. After the end of war, in spring 1945, the region together with the city became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, as a result of the Potsdam Conference. As of 1 November 1945 16.838 Germans remained in the town. Polish rule over the town was implemented April 1, 1945, hence, much before the Allies&#x27; decisions at the later Potsdam Conference. Many of Elbings&#x27; residents were interned, and finally expelled. The Polish authorities made a determined effort to establish a demographic &quot;fait accomplit&quot; before the Allies would take decisions on Germany&#x27;s future.

===History after 1945===
The area was settled by Poles after remaining Germans were either transferred or fled to Germany. Elbląg was part of the so-called Recovered Territories and out of the new inhabitants, 98% were Poles expelled from former eastern Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished, with the bricks being used to rebuild Warsaw and Gdańsk. The Communist authorities had originally planned that the Old Town, utterly destroyed during the fighting since January 23, 1945, would be built over with blocks of flats; however, economic difficulties thwarted this effort. Two churches were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s.
Along with Tricity and Szczecin, Elbląg was the scene of the Polish 1970 protests. Since 1990 the German minority population has had a modest resurgence, with the Elbinger Deutsche Minderheit Organization counting around 450 members in 2000.

Restoration of the Old Town began after 1989. Since the beginning of the restoration, an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out. Most of the city&#x27;s heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the 19th century or during World War II, but the backyards and latrines of the houses remained largely unchanged, and have provided information on the city&#x27;s history. In some instances, private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture. By 2006, approximately 75% of the Old Town had been reconstructed.

Elbląg is also home to the Elbrewery, Poland&#x27;s largest brewery, which belongs to the Żywiec Group (Heineken). The history of the Elblag Brewing Tradition dates back to 1309, when Teutonic Master Siegfried von Leuchtwangen granted brewing privileges to the city. The present brewery was founded in 1872 as the Elbinger Aktien-Brauerei. In the early 1900s, the brewery was the exclusive supplier of Pilsner beer to the court of German Emperor Wilhelm II.

==Historic buildings==
Until World War II there were many Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque houses in Elbląg&#x27;s Old Town; some of them are reconstructed. Other preserved buildings are:
*St. Nicholas Cathedral - a monumental 13th-century Gothic church (cathedral only from 1992, before it was a parochial church), destroyed by fire in the late 18th century, then damaged in World War II and repaired
*&quot;Brama Targowa&quot; (Market Gate) - erected in 1319
*St. Mary&#x27;s Church - former Dominican church, erected in the 13th century, rebuilt in the 14th and 16th centuries; damaged in World War II and reconstructed in 1961 as an art gallery; remnants of cloister are partially preserved
*Holy Ghost church with hospital, from the 14th century
*Corpus Christi church from the 14th century
*&quot;Ścieżka kościelna&quot; (Church Path) - medieval path between tenements connecting the churches of the Old Town
*Gothic houses at 13 Świętego Ducha Street and 34 Studzienna Street (reconstruction)
*Mannierist houses of the Old Town, e.g. Jost van Kampen House at 12 Garbary Street
*Postmodern reconstruction of the Old Town with new Old Town City Hall
*Church of Good Shepherd - originally Mennonite, now Polish Old Catholic church from 1890

The Elbląg Canal, built in 1825–44, is a tourist site of Elbląg. The canal is believed to be one of the most important monuments related to the history of engineering, and has been named one of the Seven Wonders of Poland. The canal was also named one of Poland&#x27;s official national Historic Monuments (&quot;Pomnik historii&quot;) in 2011. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.

==Culture==

The primary cultural institutions in Elbląg are the Archaeological and Historical Museum, the Cyprian Norwid Elbląg Library, the EL Gallery Art Center and the Aleksander Sewruk Theater. The museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use, including the only 15th century binoculars preserved in Europe.

<doc id="9864" wikidata="Q639383" url="?curid=9864" title="European Free Alliance">
<text>The European Free Alliance (EFA) is a European political party that consists of various regionalist, separatist and minority political parties in Europe. Member parties advocate either for full political independence and sovereignty, or some form of devolution or self-governance for their country or region. The party has generally limited its membership to centre-left and left-wing parties; therefore, only a fraction of European regionalist parties are members of the EFA. Since 1999, the EFA and the European Green Party (EGP) have joined forces within Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament, although some EFA members have joined other groups from time to time, for example the New Flemish Alliance which sits with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.

The EFA is represented in the European Council by Bart De Wever of the New Flemish Alliance, who has served as Prime Minister of Belgium since 2025. Two EU regions are led by EFA politicians: Flanders with Matthias Diependaele of the New Flemish Alliance and Corsica with Gilles Simeoni of . Additionally, Scotland is led by John Swinney of the Scottish National Party.

The EFA&#x27;s youth wing is the European Free Alliance Youth (EFAY), established in 2000.

==History==
Regionalists have long been represented in the European Parliament. In the 1979 election four regionalist parties obtained seats: the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Flemish People&#x27;s Union (VU), the Brussels-based Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party (SVP). The SNP, although being predominantly social-democratic, joined the European Progressive Democrats, a conservative group led by the French Rally for the Republic. The VU and the FDF joined the heterogeneous Technical Group of Independents, while the SVP joined the European People&#x27;s Party group.

In 1981, six parties (VU, the Frisian National Party, Independent Fianna Fáil, the Party of German-speaking Belgians, the Party for the Organization of a Free Brittany and the Alsace-Lorraine National Association), plus three observers (the Union of the Corsican People, UPC, the Occitan Party and the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia, CDC), joined forces to form the European Free Alliance. Regionalist MEPs continued, however, to sit in different groups also after the 1984 election: the SNP in the Gaullist-dominated European Democratic Alliance; the VU, the Sardinian Action Party (PSd&#x27;Az) and Basque Solidarity (EA) in the Rainbow Group, together with Green parties; the SVP in the European People&#x27;s Party group; the CDC with the Liberal Democrats; and Herri Batasuna among Non-Inscrits.

Only after the 1989 European Parliament election did EFA members form a united group, called Rainbow like its green predecessor. It consisted of three Italian MEPs (two for Lega Lombarda and one for the PSd&#x27;Az), two Spanish MEPs (one each for the PNV and the Andalusian Party, PA), one Belgian MEP (for VU), one French MEP (UPC), one British MEP (SNP) and one independent MEP from Ireland. They were joined by 4 MEPs from the Danish left-wing Eurosceptic People&#x27;s Movement against the EU, while the other regionalist parties, including the SVP, Batasuna and the Convergence and Union of Catalonia (CiU) declined to join.

In the 1994 European Parliament election, the regionalists lost many seats. Moreover, the EFA had suspended its major affiliate, Lega Nord, for having joined forces in government with the post-fascist National Alliance. Also, the PNV chose to switch to the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). The three remaining EFA MEPs (representing the SNP, the VU and the Canarian Coalition) formed a group with the French &quot;Énergie Radicale&quot; list and the Italian Pannella List: the European Radical Alliance.

Following the 1999 European Parliament election, in which EFA parties did quite well, EFA elected MEPs formed a joint group with the European Green Party, under the name Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA). In the event the EFA supplied ten members: two each from the Scottish SNP, the Welsh Plaid Cymru, and the Flemish VU, and one each from the Basque PNV and EA, the Andalusian PA and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG).

In the 2004 European Parliament election, the EFA, which had formally become a European political party, was reduced to four MEPs: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans) and one from the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC; Bernat Joan i Marí, replaced at the mid-term by MEP Mikel Irujo of the Basque EA). They were joined by two associate members: Tatjana Ždanoka of For Human Rights in United Latvia (PCTVL) and László Tőkés, an independent MEP and former member of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UMDR). Co-operation between the EFA and the Greens continued.

Following the 2008 revision of the EU Regulation that governs European political parties allowing the creation of European foundations affiliated to European political parties, the EFA established its official foundation/think tank, the Coppieters Foundation (CF), in September 2007.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, six MEPs were returned for the EFA: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans), one from the Party of the Corsican Nation (PNC; François Alfonsi), one from the ERC (Oriol Junqueras), and Tatjana Ždanoka, an individual member of the EFA from Latvia. After the election, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) also joined the EFA. The EFA subgroup thus counted seven MEPs.

In the 2014 European Parliament election, EFA-affiliated parties returned twelve seats to the Parliament: four for the N-VA, two for the SNP, two for &quot;The Left for the Right to Decide&quot; (an electoral list primarily composed of the ERC), one for &quot;The Peoples Decide&quot; (an electoral list mainly comprising EH Bildu, a Basque coalition including EA), one for &quot;European Spring&quot; (an electoral list comprising the Valencian Nationalist Bloc, BNV, and the Aragonese Union, ChA), one from Plaid Cymru, and one from the Latvian Russian Union (LKS). Due to ideological divergences with the Flemish Greens, the N-VA defected to the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) and the EH Bildu MEP joined the European United Left–Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group. Thus, EFA had seven members in the Greens/EFA group and four within ECR.

In the 2019 European Parliament election the EFA gained a fourth seat in the United Kingdom, due to the SNP gaining a third seat to add to Plaid&#x27;s one. However, the EFA suffered the loss of these seats in January 2020 due to Brexit, which meant SNP and PC MEPs had to leave.

==Ideology==
In the Brussels declaration of 2000, the EFA codified its political principles. The EFA stands for &quot;a Europe of Free Peoples based on the principle of subsidiarity, which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world.&quot; The EFA sees itself as an alliance of stateless peoples, striving towards recognition, autonomy, independence or wanting a proper voice in Europe. It supports European integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. It believes also that Europe should move away from further centralisation and works towards the formation of a &quot;Europe of regions&quot;. It believes that regions should have more power in Europe, for instance participating in the Council of the European Union, when matters within their competence are discussed. It also wants to protect the linguistic and cultural diversity within the EU.

The EFA broadly stands on the left wing of the political spectrum. EFA members are generally progressive, although there are some notable exceptions as the conservative New Flemish Alliance, Bavaria Party, Democratic Party of Artsakh, Schleswig Party and Future of Åland, the Christian-democratic Slovene Union and the far right South Tyrolean Freedom.

==Organisation==
The main organs of the EFA organisation are the General Assembly, the Bureau and the Secretariat.

===General Assembly===
In the General Assembly, the supreme council of the EFA, every member party has one vote.

===Bureau and Secretariat===
The Bureau takes care of daily affairs. It is chaired by Lorena Lopez de Lacalle (Basque Solidarity), president of the EFA, while Jordi Solé (Republican Left of Catalonia) is secretary-general and Anke Spoorendonk (South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association) vice-president and treasurer.

The Bureau is completed by other twelve vice-presidents: Peggy Eriksson (Future of Åland), Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru), Fernando Fuente Cortina (More—Commitment), David Grosclaude (Occitan Party), Wouter Patho (New Flemish Alliance), Frank de Boer (Frisian National Party), Patrik Peroša (The Olive Tree – Slovene Istria Party), Livia Ceccaldi-Volpei (Femu à Corsica), Zsolt Szilágyi (Hungarian Alliance of Transylvania), Ana Miranda (Galician Nationalist Bloc), Roberto Visentin (Pact for Autonomy) and Lorena López Sánchez (New Canaries).

==Membership==

Before becoming a member party, an organisation needs to have been an observer of the EFA for at least one year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region wants to join the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.

The following is the list of EFA members and former members.

<text>The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party) is a European political party composed of 76 national-level parties from across Europe, mainly active in the European Union. The ALDE Party is affiliated with Liberal International and a recognised European political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law.

It was founded on 26 March 1976 in Stuttgart as a confederation of national political parties under the name &quot;Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe&quot; and renamed &quot;European Liberals and Democrats&quot; (ELD) in 1977 and &quot;European Liberal Democrats and Reformists&quot; (ELDR) in 1986. On 30 April 2004, the ELDR was reformed as an official European party, the &quot;European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party&quot; (ELDR Party).

On 10 November 2012, the party chose its current name ALDE Party, taken from its then-European Parliament group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), which had been formed on 20 July 2004 in conjunction with the European Democratic Party (EDP). Prior to the 2004 European election, the European party had been represented through its own group, the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group (ELDR) Group. In June 2019, the ALDE group was succeeded by Renew Europe.

, ALDE Party is represented in European Union institutions, with 51 MEPs and five members of the European Commission. Of the 27 EU member states, there are two with ALDE-affiliated Prime Ministers: Kristen Michal (Estonian Reform Party) in Estonia and Alexander De Croo (Open VLD) in Belgium. ALDE Party members are also in governments in ten other EU member states: Cyprus, France, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Germany and the Netherlands. Charles Michel, former Belgian prime minister, was the president of the European Council until December 2024.

ALDE&#x27;s think tank is the European Liberal Forum, led by Jan-Christoph Oetjen MEP, and gathers 46 member organisations. The youth wing of ALDE is the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), which is predominantly based upon youth and student liberal organisations but contains also a small number of individual members. LYMEC is led by Ines Holzegger.

In 2011, ALDE Party became the first pan-European party to create the status of individual membership. Since then, between 1000 and close to 3000 members (the numbers fluctuate annually) maintained direct membership in the ALDE Party from several EU countries. Over 40 coordinators mobilised liberal ideas, initiatives and expertise across the continent under the leadership of the steering committee, which was first chaired by Julie Cantalou. The ALDE Party took a step further in the direction of becoming a truly pan-European party when granting voting rights to individual members’ delegates at the Party Congress. Individual membership was eventually discontinued in 2023.

== History of pan-European liberalism ==

Pan-European liberalism has a long history dating back to the foundation of Liberal International in April 1947. On 26 March 1976, the Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe was established in Stuttgart. The founding parties of the federation were the Free Democratic Party of Germany, Radical Party of France, Venstre of Denmark, Italian Liberal Party, Dutch People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democratic Party of Luxembourg. Observer members joining later in 1976 were the Danish Social Liberal Party, French Radical Party of the Left and Independent Republicans, British Liberal Party, and Italian Republican Party. In 1977, the federation was renamed European Liberals and Democrats, in 1986, European Liberal Democrats and Reformists.

It evolved into the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR Party) in 2004, when it was founded as an official European party under that name and incorporated under Belgian law at an extraordinary Congress in Brussels, held on 30 April 2004 the day before the enlargement of the European Union. At the same time the matching group in the European Parliament, the European Liberal Democrats and Reformists Group allied with the members of the newly elected European Democratic Party, forming the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) with a matching ALDE Group in the European Parliament.

On 10 November 2012, the ELDR Party adopted the name of the alliance between the two parties, to match the parliamentary group and the alliance.

On 12 June 2019, the ALDE group was succeeded by a new enlarged group, Renew Europe, which primarily consists of ALDE and EDP member parties and France&#x27;s La République En Marche! (LREM).

<text>The European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP Group or simply EPP) is a political group of the European Parliament consisting of deputies (MEPs) from the member parties of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). Sometimes it also includes independent MEPs and/or deputies from unaffiliated national parties. The EPP Group comprises politicians of Christian democratic, conservative and liberal-conservative orientation.

The European People&#x27;s Party was officially founded as a European political party in 1976. However, the European People&#x27;s Party Group in the European Parliament has existed in one form or another since June 1953, from the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, making it one of the oldest European-level political groups. It has been the largest political group in the European Parliament since 1999.

==History==
The Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (the predecessor of the present day European Parliament) first met on 10 September 1952 and the first Christian Democratic Group was unofficially formed the next day, with Maan Sassen as president. The group held 38 of the 78 seats, two short of an absolute majority. On 16 June 1953, the Common Assembly passed a resolution enabling the official formation of political groups; further, on 23 June 1953 the constituent declaration of the group was published and the group was officially formed.
The Christian Democrat group was the biggest group at formation, but as time wore on, it lost support and was the second-biggest group by the time of the 1979 elections. As the European Community expanded into the European Union, the dominant centre-right parties in the new member states were not necessarily Christian democratic, and the EPP (European People&#x27;s Party, the pan-continental political party founded in 1976, to which all group members are now affiliated) feared being sidelined. To counter this, the EPP expanded its remit to cover the centre-right regardless of tradition and pursued a policy of integrating liberal-conservative parties.

This policy led to Greek New Democracy and Spanish People&#x27;s Party MEPs joining the EPP Group. The British Conservative Party and Danish Conservative People&#x27;s Party tried to maintain a group of their own, named the &quot;European Democrats&quot; (ED), but lack of support and the problems inherent in maintaining a small group forced ED&#x27;s collapse in the 1990s, and its members crossed the floor to join the EPP Group. The parties of these MEPs also became full members of the EPP (with the exception of the British Conservative Party, which did not join) and this consolidation process of the European centre-right continued during the 1990s with the acquisition of members from the Italian party . However, the consolidation was not unalloyed and a split emerged with the Eurosceptic MEPs who congregated in a subgroup within the Group, also called the &quot;European Democrats&quot; (ED).

Nevertheless, the consolidation held through the 1990s, assisted by the group being renamed the &quot;European People&#x27;s Party – European Democrats&quot; (EPP-ED) Group; after the 1999 European elections, the EPP-ED reclaimed its position as the largest group in the Parliament from the Party of European Socialists (PES) Group.

Size was not enough, however: the group did not have a majority. It continued therefore to engage in the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; (a coalition with the PES Group, or occasionally the Liberals) to generate the majorities required by the cooperation procedure under the Single European Act.

Meanwhile, the parties in the European Democrats subgroup were growing restless, with the establishment in July 2006 of the Movement for European Reform, and finally left following the 2009 elections, when the Czech Civic Democratic Party and British Conservative Party formed their own right-wing &quot;European Conservatives and Reformists Group&quot; (ECR) group on 22 June 2009, abolishing the European Democrats subgroup from that date. The EPP-ED Group reverted to its original name – the EPP Group – immediately.

=== 7th European Parliament (2009) ===
In the 7th European Parliament, the EPP Group remained the largest parliamentary group with 275 MEPs. It is currently the only political group in the European parliament to fully represent its corresponding European political party, i.e. the European People&#x27;s Party. The United Kingdom was the only member state to not be represented in the group; this state of affairs ceased temporarily on 28 February 2018, when two MEPs suspended from the British Conservative Party left the ECR Group and joined the EPP. The two MEPs later joined a breakaway political party in the UK, The Independent Group.

=== 8th European Parliament (2014) ===

After twelve member parties in the EPP called for Hungary&#x27;s Fidesz&#x27;s expulsion or suspension, Fidesz&#x27;s membership was suspended with a common agreement on 20 March 2019. The suspension was applied only to the EPP but not to its group in the Parliament. On 3 March 2021, Fidesz decided to leave the EPP group, after the group&#x27;s new rules, however still kept their membership in the party. On 18 March 2021, Fidesz decided to leave the European People&#x27;s Party.

=== 9th European Parliament (2019) ===
In the 9th European Parliament, the EPP won 182 seats out of a total of 751. They formed a coalition with Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and Renew Europe to elect Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission.

=== 10th European Parliament (2024) ===
On June 18, 6 new parties joined the group, including the Hungarian Respect and Freedom Party (TISZA) and their 7 MEPs, the Dutch Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) and Czech Mayors and Independents (STAN), each with 2 MEPs, as well as the Danish Liberal Alliance, Dutch New Social Contract (NSC), and the German Family Party, each with 1 MEP. Combined, the group expanded by 14 MEPs.

Later that day, the Hungarian Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP) announced their departure from the EPP Group, due to the admission of the Tisza Party.

On 19 June, the group re-elected Manfred Weber as chairman of the group, and the 10 vice-chairpersons.

==Membership at formation==
The 38 members in the group on 11 September 1952 were as follows:

==Structure==

===Organisation===
The EPP Group is governed by a collective (referred to as the &quot;Presidency&quot;) that allocates tasks. The Presidency consists of the Group Chair and a maximum of ten Vice-Chairs, including the Treasurer. The day-to-day running of the EPP Group is performed by its secretariat in the European Parliament, led by its Secretary-General. The Group runs its own think-tank, the European Ideas Network, which brings together opinion-formers from across Europe to discuss issues facing the European Union from a centre-right perspective.

The EPP Group Presidency includes:

The chairs of the group and its predecessors from 1952 to 2024 are as follows:

==Activities==

===In the news===
Activities performed by the group in the period between June 2004 and June 2008 include monitoring elections in Palestine and Ukraine; encouraging transeuropean rail travel, telecoms deregulation, energy security, a common energy policy, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Union, partial reform of the CAP and attempts to tackle illegal immigration; denouncing Russian involvement in South Ossetia; supporting the Constitution Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty; debating globalisation, relations with China, and Taiwan; backing plans to outlaw Holocaust denial; nominating Anna Politkovskaya for the 2007 Sakharov Prize; expelling Daniel Hannan from the Group; the discussion about whether ED MEPs should remain within EPP-ED or form a group of their own; criticisms of the group&#x27;s approach to tackling low turnout for the 2009 elections; the group&#x27;s use of the two-President arrangement; and the group&#x27;s proposal to ban the Islamic Burka dress across the EU.

===Parliamentary activity profile===
The debates and votes in the European Parliament are tracked by its website and categorised by the groups that participate in them and the rule of procedure that they fall into. The results give a profile for each group by category and the total indicates the group&#x27;s level of participation in Parliamentary debates. The activity profile for each group for the period 1 August 2004 to 1 August 2008 in the Sixth Parliament is given on the diagram on the right. The group is denoted in blue.

The website shows the group as participating in 659 motions, making it the third most active group during the period.

===Publications===
The group produces many publications, which can be found on its website. Documents produced in 2008 cover subjects such as dialogue with the Orthodox Church, study days, its strategy for 2008–09, Euro-Mediterranean relations, and the Lisbon Treaty. It also publishes a yearbook and irregularly publishes a presentation, a two-page summary of the group.

==Academic analysis==
The group has been characterised as a three-quarters-male group that, prior to ED&#x27;s departure, was only 80% cohesive and split between centre-right Europhiles (the larger EPP subgroup) and right-wing Eurosceptics (the smaller ED subgroup). The group as a whole is described as ambiguous on hypothetical EU taxes, against taxation, environmental issues, social issues (LGBT rights, abortion, euthanasia) and full Turkish accession to the European Union, and for a deeper Federal Europe, deregulation, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and controlling migration into the EU.

<text>The Left in the European Parliament (The Left) is a left-wing political group of the European Parliament established in 1995. Prior to January 2021 it was named the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (, GUE/NGL).

The group is mainly composed of political parties with democratic socialist, anti-capitalist, and Eurosceptic orientations, as well as communist parties and the Italian Five Star Movement.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
In 1995, the enlargement of the European Union led to the creation of the Nordic Green Left (NGL) group of parties. The NGL merged with the Confederal Group of the European United Left (GUE) on 6 January 1995, forming the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group at the insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs. The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish Left Alliance, the Swedish Left Party, the Danish Socialist People&#x27;s Party, the United Left of Spain (including the Spanish Communist Party), the Synaspismos of Greece, the French Communist Party, the Portuguese Communist Party, the Communist Party of Greece, and the Communist Refoundation Party of Italy.

In 1998 Ken Coates, an MEP expelled from the UK Labour Party and who co-founded the Independent Labour Network, joined the group.

In 1999 the German Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the Greek Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI) joined as full members, while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance LO–LCR and the one MEP for the Dutch Socialist Party joined as associate members.

In 2002 four MEPs from the French Citizen and Republican Movement and one from the Danish People&#x27;s Movement against the EU also joined the group. In 2004 no MEPs were elected from LO–LCR and DIKKI — which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution — and the French Citizen and Republican Movement did not put forward candidates. MEPs from the Portuguese Left Bloc, the Irish Sinn Féin, the Progressive Party of Working People of Cyprus, and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia joined the group. The Danish Socialist People&#x27;s Party, a member of the Nordic Green Left, left the group to instead sit in the Greens–European Free Alliance group.

In 2009 no MEPs were elected from the Italian Communist Refoundation Party and the Finnish Left Alliance. MEPs from the Irish Socialist Party, the Socialist Party of Latvia, and the French Left Party joined the group.

In 2013 one MEP from the Croatian Labourists – Labour Party also joined the group. In 2014 no MEPs were elected from the Irish Socialist Party, the Socialist Party of Latvia, and the Croatian Labourists – Labour Party. MEPs from the Spanish Podemos as well as EH Bildu and the Dutch Party for the Animals joined the group, while MEPs from the Italian Communist Refoundation Party and the Finnish Left Alliance re-entered parliament and rejoined. The Communist Party of Greece, a founding member of the group, decided to leave and instead sit as Non-Inscrits.

In 2019 no MEPs were elected from the French Communist Party, the Danish People&#x27;s Movement against the EU, the Dutch Socialist Party, and from the Italian parties The Left and the Communist Refoundation Party. MEPs from the French La France insoumise, the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium, the German Human Environment Animal Protection Party, the Irish Independents 4 Change, and the Danish Red-Green Alliance joined the group.

=== 10th European Parliament (2024–present) ===
In 2024 MEPs from the Italian parties Italian Left and Five Star Movement joined the group.

== Positions ==
According to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present European Union political structure, but it is committed to integration. That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union, the total change of institutions to make them fully democratic, breaking with neoliberal monetarist policies, and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and strengthen the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The group is divided between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve their aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as insiders within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision; and as outsiders by its willingness to seek another Europe, which would abolish the Maastricht Treaty.

GUE/NGL has been split on the issue of Russia. On 1 March 2022, 7 MEPs out of the group&#x27;s 37 voted against the parliament&#x27;s resolution condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while 10 also abstained in the vote that passed 637–14. Even before the war, there have been tensions in the group, especially with the Irish MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly working to defuse sanctions on Russia placed because of the downing of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

<text>The European Democratic Group, more commonly known as European Democrats, was a conservative political group that operated in the European Parliament between 1979 and 1992. At its height in July 1979, it had 63 MEPs.

Ideologically, ED was more Eurosceptic and right-wing than its centre-right rival European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). Its members included parties such as the UK Conservative Party of Margaret Thatcher, Danish Conservative People&#x27;s Party, and Spanish People&#x27;s Alliance. In 1992, ED became a subgroup of EPP, now the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats. ED split from EPP in 2009 to re-create the group as the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists.

==European Democrats in the European Parliament==

===1979–1992===
The European Democratic Group (ED) was formed on 17 July 1979 by British Conservative Party, Danish Conservative People&#x27;s Party and other MEPs after their success in the 1979 elections. It supplanted the earlier European Conservative Group.

In the late seventies and early eighties, the ED was the third-largest political group in the European Parliament.

However, the group saw its membership fall sharply in the late 1980s, as many centre-right members moved to the rival European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), dominated by the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), Italian Christian Democrats and the ideology of Christian democracy in general. The ED had been somewhat further from the political centre and less pro-European than the EPP. Largely isolated, even hardline eurosceptics like Margaret Thatcher conceded that the British Conservatives could not be effectively heard from such a peripheral group.

===1992–1999===
On 1 May 1992, the ED (now largely composed of UK Conservative Party members) dissolved, and its remaining members were accorded &quot;associated party&quot; status in the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP Group); that is, being part of the parliamentary group without retaining actual membership in the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) itself. This was considered essential for the Conservatives, as the EPP was generally seen as quite favourable to European integration, a stance at odds with their core ideology. The Conservatives&#x27; relationship to the EPP would become a sore point in the following years, particularly for the eurosceptic general membership in Britain. Then-leader of the British Conservative Party William Hague hoped to put the issue to rest by negotiating a new arrangement in 1999 by which the EPP&#x27;s parliamentary group would rebrand itself as the European People&#x27;s Party–European Democrats (EPP-ED), with the &quot;European Democrat&quot; nomenclature returning after a seven-year hiatus. This was intended to nominally underscore the Conservatives&#x27; status apart from the rest of EPP, and it was hoped that with the coming enlargement of the European Union numerous newly involved right-wing parties, averse to the EPP proper for its perceived European federalism, would be willing to instead enter the ED subgroup, growing the overall alignment.

===1999–2009===
The arrangement proved to do little to appease opposition. Hague&#x27;s successor, Iain Duncan Smith, made a concerted drive at one point to resurrect the European Democratic Group, but backed off when it became clear that Conservative MEPs would not move voluntarily. The hope that multiple Central and European parties would join ED also proved to be dubious, as only the Czech Civic Democratic Party took up the offer, with the remainder joining EPP proper or other groups such as Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) or Independence and Democracy (IND/DEM). Meanwhile, the ED remained a more eurosceptic subgroup within the broader EPP-ED bloc that contributed slightly more than 10% of its total MEPs. It resisted the trend of incorporating as a European political party.

During the 2005 Conservative leadership contest, eventual winner David Cameron pledged to withdraw the Conservatives from the EPP-ED group, while opponent David Davis argued in a letter to the editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that the current ED arrangement allowed the Conservatives to maintain suitable distance from EPP while still having influence in the largest parliamentary grouping. Conservative/EPP-ED MEP Martin Callanan responded in that paper the following day:
The Czech Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Law and Justice (PiS) of Poland and the Rally For France party were among the first to discuss forming a breakaway group under the Movement for European Reform. Sir Reg Empey, Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has committed his party thereunto Its position would be that the European Union should exist, but as a looser supranational organisation than at present, making the group less eurosceptic than the UEN and IND/DEM groups. Some members from the above parties founded a new organisation, the Alliance for an Open Europe, in the midst of this debate, with broadly similar objectives.

Cameron initially intended to form the new group in 2006, though this aspiration had to be cancelled due to their main prospective partners, the ODS and PiS, being unable or unwilling to break away from their then-groupings; the new grouping was put on hiatus until the 2009 European elections. By then, new factors—including the collapse of the UEN group—made conditions for forming a new political grouping much more favourable. On 22 June 2009, the founder members of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group), all signatories of the Prague Declaration announced that they were to leave the EPP-ED, and in virtue of that fact, the European Democrats movement. This announcement ended the 30-year existence of the European Democrats in the European Parliament.

===Members===
The following political parties were associated with the European Democrats at some point:
==European Democrats in PACE (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe)==

The European Democrat Group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was founded as the Group of Independent Representatives in 1970 by British and Scandinavian members of PACE, having about 35–40 members from the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Turkey, Sweden and Switzerland. It adopted the European Democrats Group name in September 1980, later becoming the European Conservatives Group in 2014.

<text>The Epistle to the Ephesians is the tenth book of the New Testament. According to its text, the letter was written by Paul the Apostle, an attribution that Christians traditionally accepted. However, starting in 1792, some scholars have claimed the letter is actually Deutero-Pauline, meaning that it is pseudepigrapha written in Paul&#x27;s name by a later author strongly influenced by Paul&#x27;s thought. According to one scholarly source, the letter was probably written &quot;by a loyal disciple to sum up Paul&#x27;s teaching and to apply it to a new situation fifteen to twenty-five years after the Apostle&#x27;s death&quot;.

==Themes==
According to New Testament scholar Daniel Wallace, the theme may be stated pragmatically as &quot;Christians, get along with each other! Maintain the unity practically which Christ has effected positionally by his death.&quot;

Another major theme in Ephesians is the keeping of Christ&#x27;s body (that is, the Church) pure and holy. 
In the second part of the letter, Ephesians 4:17–6:20, the author gives practical advice in how to live a holy, pure, and Christ-inspired lifestyle.

==Composition==
According to tradition, the Apostle Paul wrote the letter while he was in prison in Rome (around AD 62). This would be about the same time as the Epistle to the Colossians (which in many points it resembles) and the Epistle to Philemon. However, many critical scholars have questioned the authorship of the letter and suggest that it may have been written between AD 80 and 100.

===Authorship===

The first verse in the letter identifies Paul as its author. While early lists of New Testament books, including the Muratorian fragment and possibly Marcion&#x27;s canon (if it is to be equated with the Epistle to the Laodiceans), attribute the letter to Paul, more recently there have been challenges to Pauline authorship on the basis of the letter&#x27;s characteristically non-Pauline syntax, terminology, and eschatology.

Biblical scholar Harold Hoehner, surveying 279 commentaries written between 1519 and 2001, found that 54% favored Pauline authorship, 39% concluded against Pauline authorship and 7% remained uncertain. Norman Perrin and Dennis C. Duling found that of six authoritative scholarly references, &quot;four of the six decide for pseudonymity, and the other two (Peake&#x27;s Commentary on the Bible and the Jerome Biblical Commentary) recognize the difficulties in maintaining Pauline authorship. Indeed, the difficulties are insurmountable.&quot; Bible scholar Raymond E. Brown asserts that about 80% of critical scholarship judges that Paul did not write Ephesians.

There are four main theories in biblical scholarship that address the question of Pauline authorship.
* The traditional view that the epistle is written by Paul is supported by scholars that include Ezra Abbot, Ragnar Asting, Markus Barth, F. F. Bruce, A. Robert, and André Feuillet, Gaugler, Grant, Harnack, Haupt, Fenton John Anthony Hort, Klijn, Johann David Michaelis, A. Van Roon, Sanders, Schille, Klyne Snodgrass, John R. W. Stott, Frank Thielman, Daniel B. Wallace, Brooke Foss Westcott, and Theodor Zahn. For a defense of the Pauline authorship of Ephesians, see &quot;Ephesians: An Exegetical Commentary&quot;, Harold Hoehner, pp. 2–61.
* A second position suggests that Ephesians was dictated by Paul with interpolations from another author. Some of the scholars that espouse this view include Albertz, Benoit, Cerfaux, Goguel, Harrison, H. J. Holtzmann, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, and Wagenführer.
* A third group thinks it improbable that Paul authored Ephesians. Among this group are Allan, Beare, Brandon, Rudolf Bultmann, Conzelmann, Dibelius, Goodspeed, Kilsemann, J. Knox, W.L. Knox, Kümmel, K and S Lake, Marxsen, Masson, Mitton, Moffatt, Nineham, Pokorny, Schweizer, and J. Weiss.
* Still other scholars suggest there is a lack of conclusive evidence. Some of this group are Cadbury, Julicher, McNeile, and Williams.

===Place, date, and purpose of the writing of the letter===
While most English translations indicate that the letter was addressed to &quot;the saints who are in Ephesus&quot; (1:1), the words &quot;in Ephesus&quot; do not appear in the best and earliest manuscripts of the letter, leading most textual critics, like Bart Ehrman, to regard the words as an interpolation. This lack of any internal references to Ephesus in the early manuscripts may have led Marcion, a second-century heresiarch who created the first New Testament canon, to believe that the letter was actually addressed to the church at Laodicea. For details see Epistle to the Laodiceans.

Furthermore, if Paul is regarded as the author, the impersonal character of the letter, which lacks personal greetings or any indication that the author has personal knowledge of his recipients, is incongruous with the account in Acts of Paul staying more than two years in Ephesus. For these reasons, most regard Ephesians to be a circular letter intended for many churches. The Jerusalem Bible notes that some critics think the words &quot;who are&quot; would have been followed by a blank to be filled in with the name of &quot;whichever church was being sent the letter&quot;.

If Paul was the author of the letter, then it was probably written from Rome during Paul&#x27;s first imprisonment, and probably soon after his arrival there in the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. However, scholars who dispute Paul&#x27;s authorship date the letter to between 70 and 80 AD. In the latter case, the possible location of the authorship could have been within the church of Ephesus itself. Ignatius of Antioch seemed to be very well versed in the epistle to the Ephesians, and mirrors many of his own thoughts in his own epistle to the Ephesians.

==Outline==

Ephesians contains:
* Ephesians 1:1–2. The greeting, from Paul to the church of Ephesus.
* Ephesians 1:3–2:10. A general account of the blessings that the gospel reveals. This includes the source of these blessings, the means by which they are attained, the reason why they are given, and their final result. The whole of the section Ephesians 1:3–23 consists in the original Greek of just two lengthy and complex sentences. It ends with a fervent prayer for the further spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians.
* Ephesians 2:11–3:21. A description of the change in the spiritual position of Gentiles as a result of the work of Christ. It ends with an account of how Paul was selected and qualified to be an apostle to the Gentiles, in the hope that this will keep them from being dispirited and lead him to pray for them.
* Ephesians 4:1–16. A chapter on unity in the midst of the diversity of gifts among believers.
* Ephesians 4:17–6:9. Instructions about ordinary life and different relationships.
* Ephesians 6:10–24. The imagery of spiritual warfare (including the metaphor of the Armor of God), the mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessings.

==Founding of the church at Ephesus==

Paul&#x27;s first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in Acts 18:19–21. The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus &quot;three years&quot;, for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here &quot;a great door and effectual&quot; was opened to him, and the church was established and strengthened by his diligent labours there. From Ephesus the gospel spread abroad &quot;almost throughout all Asia.&quot; The word &quot;mightily grew and prevailed&quot; despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.

On his last journey to Jerusalem, the apostle landed at Miletus and, summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them a farewell charge, expecting to see them no more.

The following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced:

# Acts 20:19 = Ephesians 4:2. The phrase &quot;lowliness of mind&quot;.
# Acts 20:27 = Ephesians 1:11. The word &quot;counsel&quot;, denoting the divine plan.
# Acts 20:32 = Ephesians 3:20. The divine ability.
# Acts 20:32 = Ephesians 2:20. The building upon the foundation.
# Acts 20:32 = Ephesians 1:14,18 &quot;The inheritance of the saints.&quot;

==Purpose==
The purpose of the epistle, and to whom it was written, are matters of much speculation. It was regarded by C.H. Dodd as the &quot;crown of Paulinism.&quot; In general, it is born out of its particular socio-historical context and the situational context of both the author and the audience. Originating in the circumstance of a multicultural church (primarily Jewish and Hellenistic), the author addressed issues appropriate to the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds present in the community.
The author exhorts the church repeatedly to embrace a specific view of salvation, which he then explicates.

Frank Charles Thompson argues that the main theme of Ephesians is in response to the newly converted Jews who often separated themselves from their Gentile brethren. The unity of the church, especially between Jew and Gentile believers, is the keynote of the book.

==Interpretations==
Ephesians is notable for its domestic code treatment in Ephesians 5:22–6:9, covering husband-wife, parent-child, and master-slave relationships. In Ephesians 5:22, wives are urged to submit to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives &quot;as Christ loved the Church.&quot; Christian Egalitarian theologians, such as Katharine Bushnell and Jessie Penn-Lewis, interpret these commands in the context of the preceding verse, for all Christians to &quot;submit to one another.&quot; Thus, it is two-way, mutual submission of both husbands to wives and wives to husbands. But according to Peter O&#x27;Brien, professor emeritus at Moore Theological College, this would be the only instance of this meaning of submission in the whole New Testament, indeed in any extant comparable Greek texts; by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s account, the word simply does not connote mutuality. Dallas Theological Seminary professor Daniel Wallace understands it to be an extension of Ephesians 5:15-21 on being filled by the Holy Spirit.

In the period leading up to the American Civil War (1861–65), Ephesians 6:5 on master-slave relationships was one of the Bible verses used by Confederate slaveholders in support of a slaveholding position.

<doc id="9875" wikidata="Q11287" url="?curid=9875" title="Exploit (computer security)">
<text>An exploit is a method or piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software, applications, networks, operating systems, or hardware, typically for malicious purposes.
The term &quot;exploit&quot; derives from the English verb &quot;to exploit,&quot; meaning &quot;to use something to one’s own advantage.&quot;
Exploits are designed to identify flaws, bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access to systems, take control of systems, install malware, or steal sensitive data.
While an exploit by itself may not be a malware, it serves as a vehicle for delivering malicious software by breaching security controls.

Exploits target vulnerabilities, which are essentially flaws or weaknesses in a system&#x27;s defenses.
Common targets for exploits include operating systems, web browsers, and various applications, where hidden vulnerabilities can compromise the integrity and security of computer systems.
Exploits can cause unintended or unanticipated behavior in systems, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

Many exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system.
Attackers may use multiple exploits in succession to first gain low-level access and then escalate privileges repeatedly until they reach the highest administrative level, often referred to as &quot;root.&quot;
This technique of chaining several exploits together to perform a single attack is known as an exploit chain.

Exploits that remain unknown to everyone except the individuals who discovered and developed them are referred to as zero-day or &quot;0day&quot; exploits.
After an exploit is disclosed to the authors of the affected software, the associated vulnerability is often fixed through a patch, rendering the exploit unusable.
This is why some black hat hackers, as well as military or intelligence agency hackers, do not publish their exploits but keep them private.
One scheme that offers zero-day exploits is known as exploit as a service.

Researchers estimate that malicious exploits cost the global economy over US$450 billion annually.
In response to this threat, organizations are increasingly utilizing cyber threat intelligence to identify vulnerabilities and prevent hacks before they occur.

==Classification==
There are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit communicates to the vulnerable software.

A &quot;remote exploit&quot; works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.

A &quot;local exploit&quot; requires prior access or physical access to the vulnerable system, and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application. A common form of exploits against client applications are browser exploits. Exploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. 

Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples.

Exploitations are commonly categorized and named by the type of vulnerability they exploit , whether they are local/remote and the result of running the exploit (e.g. EoP, DoS, spoofing). 

=== Zero-click ===
A zero-click attack is an exploit that requires no user interaction to operate – that is to say, no key-presses or mouse clicks. FORCEDENTRY, discovered in 2021, is an example of a zero-click attack.

These exploits are commonly the most sought after exploits (specifically on the underground exploit market) because the target typically has no way of knowing they have been compromised at the time of exploitation.

In 2022, NSO Group was reportedly selling zero-click exploits to governments for breaking into individuals&#x27; phones.

For mobile devices, the National Security Agency (NSA) points out that timely updating of software and applications, avoiding public network connections, and turn the device Off and On at least once a week can mitigate the threat of zero-click attacks. Experts say that protection practices for traditional endpoints are also applicable to mobile devices; many exploits exist only in memory, not in files. Theoretically, restarting the device can wipe malware payloads from memory, forcing attackers back to the beginning of the attack chain. 

==Pivoting==

Pivoting is a technique employed by both hackers and penetration testers to expand their access within a target network. By compromising a system, attackers can leverage it as a platform to target other systems that are typically shielded from direct external access by firewalls. Internal networks often contain a broader range of accessible machines compared to those exposed to the internet. For example, an attacker might compromise a web server on a corporate network and then utilize it to target other systems within the same network. This approach is often referred to as a multi-layered attack. Pivoting is also known as &quot;island hopping&quot;.

Pivoting can further be distinguished into proxy pivoting and VPN pivoting:

* Proxy pivoting is the practice of channeling traffic through a compromised target using a proxy payload on the machine and launching attacks from the computer. This type of pivoting is restricted to certain TCP and UDP ports that are supported by the proxy.

* VPN pivoting enables the attacker to create an encrypted layer to tunnel into the compromised machine to route any network traffic through that target machine, for example, to run a vulnerability scan on the internal network through the compromised machine, effectively giving the attacker full network access as if they were behind the firewall.

Typically, the proxy or VPN applications enabling pivoting are executed on the target computer as the payload of an exploit.

Pivoting is usually done by infiltrating a part of a network infrastructure (as an example, a vulnerable printer or thermostat) and using a scanner to find other devices connected to attack them. By attacking a vulnerable piece of networking, an attacker could infect most or all of a network and gain complete control.

<text>The erg is a unit of energy equal to 10−7joules (100nJ). It is not an SI unit, instead originating from the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). Its name is derived from (), a Greek word meaning &#x27;work&#x27; or &#x27;task&#x27;.

An erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimetre. In the CGS base units, it is equal to one gram centimetre-squared per second-squared (g⋅cm2/s2). It is thus equal to 10−7 joules or 100 nanojoules (nJ) in SI units.

* 1 erg = = 
* 1 erg = = = 
* 1 erg = = 
* 1 erg = = 
* 1 erg = 

==History==
In 1864, Rudolf Clausius proposed the Greek word () for the unit of energy, work and heat. In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including British physicists James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson recommended the general adoption of the centimetre, the gramme, and the second as fundamental units (C.G.S. System of Units). To distinguish derived units, they recommended using the prefix &quot;C.G.S. unit of ...&quot; and requested that the word &quot;erg&quot; or &quot;ergon&quot; be strictly limited to refer to the &quot;C.G.S. unit of energy&quot;.

In 1922, chemist William Draper Harkins proposed the name micri-erg as a convenient unit to measure the surface energy of molecules in surface chemistry. It would equate to 10−14 erg, the equivalent to 10−21 joule.

The erg is not a part of the International System of Units (SI), which has been recommended since 1 January 1978 when the European Economic Community ratified a directive of 1971 that implemented SI as agreed by the General Conference of Weights and Measures. It is the unit of energy in Gaussian units, which are widely used in astrophysics, applications involving microscopic problems and relativistic electrodynamics, and sometimes in mechanics.

<doc id="9878" wikidata="Q1382204" url="?curid=9878" title="Everway">
<text>Everway is a fantasy role-playing game first published by Wizards of the Coast under their Alter Ego brand in 1995. Its lead designer was Jonathan Tweet. Marketed as a &quot;Visionary Roleplaying Game&quot;, it has often been characterized as an innovative concept with limited commercial success. Wizards later abandoned the line, and Rubicon Games purchased it, and published several supplements. The line was sold again to Gaslight Press in February 2001. The line is currently with The Everway Company, which has released a Silver Anniversary Edition. 

==Setting==
The game has a fantasy setting of the multiverse type containing many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. It appears to have been heavily influenced by divinatory tarot, the four classical elements of ancient Greece, and world mythology. 

==Overview==
The game was first with implementing, in a commercial game, several new concepts including much more picture-based/visual source material and character creation than usual. Like other works by Jonathan Tweet, the rules are very simple and flexible. It is also one of a few diceless role-playing games. The Fortune Deck works as a randomizer and inspirational tool, and the results obtained by it are highly subjective. In order to clarify their use, Tweet coined some new vocabulary to describe and formalize methods of gamemaster adjudication; these terms have been adopted by the wider tabletop RPG community. Tweet&#x27;s adjudication terms are: Karma (making a decision based on character abilities, tactics, and the internal logic of a fictional situation), Drama (making a decision based on what moves the story along), and Fortune (letting a randomizer — drawing a card in &quot;Everway&quot;, but could also refer to rolling dice in other games — determine the outcome).

&quot;Everway&quot; was released as a boxed set designed by Jonathan Tweet, Jenny Scott, Aron Anderson, Scott Hungerford, Kathy Ice, Bob Kruger, and John Tynes, with illustrations by Doug Alexander, Rick Berry, Daniel Gelon, Janine Johnston, Hannibal King, Scott Kirschner, Ed Lee, John Matson, Martin McKenna, Ian Miller, Jeff Miracola, Roger Raupp, Andrew Robinson, Christopher Rush, and Amy Weber, and cover art by Susan Harris

==First edition components==

== Setting ==
The games revolve around heroes with the power of &quot;spherewalking&quot; traveling between worlds called &quot;spheres&quot;. Spheres typically are composed of many &quot;realms&quot;. Nearly all spheres are inhabited by humans, with mostly realistic physics. The theme is fantasy-oriented as opposed to science fictional. Advanced technology is explicitly forbidden in the character creation rules. The authors considered anthropology in terms of describing how the people of various spheres live, including many similarities across cultures. Some of these common features are entirely realistic (language, art), and others plainly related to the game&#x27;s fantasy elements (magic, knowledge of the Fortune Deck). 

The titular city of Everway is located in a realm called Roundwander, in the sphere called Fourcorner. Roundwander is the only realm in Fourcorner that is described. There is some detail on the sphere&#x27;s main city, Everway, which contains a stone pyramid, a set of family-oriented guilds, and various exotic events related to the city&#x27;s position as an inter-planar trading center. Several dozen other spheres are given one-sentence and a few are given page-long summaries, One is detailed as the setting for a sample adventure, &quot;Journey to Stonekeep&quot;.

==Character creation ==
Character design is abstract and simple by most role-playing games&#x27; standards. Each character begins with twenty points to divide between four Element scores roughly equivalent to statistics for Strength (Fire), Perception (Water), Intelligence (Air) and Endurance (Earth). Scores range from 1 (pathetic) to 3 (average) to 10 (godlike), so a generic hero would have scores of 5. Each Element also has a specialty for which a character can get a 1-point bonus; e.g., a 5-Air hero with an Air specialty of &quot;Writing&quot; could write as though their Air score were 6. As a general rule a statistic of N is twice as capable as a level of N-1, where this makes sense. (A 5-Fire, 5-Earth hero can typically defeat two 4-Fire, 5-Earth enemies, or handily defeat a 3-Fire, 5-Earth character in foot race, but cannot necessarily run twice as fast even though speed is governed by Fire).

Each character also has Powers representing unusual abilities. These cost from zero to three or more points depending on whether they should be considered Frequent, Major (or even &quot;Twice Major&quot;, for especially powerful abilities that significantly affect gameplay) and/or Versatile. For instance, a &quot;Cat Familiar&quot;, a slightly intelligent cat, is arguably worth two points for being Frequent (usually around and often useful) and Versatile (able to scout, carry messages, and fight). A &quot;Winning Smile&quot; that makes the hero likable is worth zero points because of its trivial effect, while a &quot;Charming Song&quot; that inspires one emotion when played might be useful enough to count as Frequent (1 point). There is no strict rule for deciding what a Power is worth. Each hero can have one 0-point Power for free; additional Powers that would otherwise cost zero points instead cost one.

Magic is also abstract. A hero wanting access to magic, as opposed to a few specific Powers, must design their own magic system. This is done by choosing an Element for its basis, which affects its theme; e.g., Air is associated with speech and intellect and would be suitable for a system of spoken spells gained through study. The new Magic statistic has a 1–10 rating and point cost, and can be no higher than the Element on what it is based. The game&#x27;s rules suggest listing examples of what the magic system can do at each power level, working these out with the GM. It is suggested that most characters do not need magic and that it is not suitable for new players.

Finally, each hero has personality traits based on the game&#x27;s Fortune and Vision cards. Players are to choose one or more Vision cards and base a backstory on them, and to have three Fortune cards representing a Virtue, Fault, and Fate (a challenge they will face). These three cards can change to represent new phases in the hero&#x27;s life. There is a list of suggested Motives for why the hero is adventuring, such as &quot;Adversity&quot; or &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, but this feature has no gameplay effect.

Equipment such as weaponry is handled completely abstractly, with no specific rules for item cost, carrying capacity, or combat statistics. However, a particularly powerful piece of equipment—for example, a cloak that renders its wearer invisible for a brief period—may be treated as a Power that the hero must spend their initial element points on.

== The Fortune Deck ==
To decide what happens, the GM considers the rules of Karma (characters&#x27; abilities, tactics, logic), Drama (the needs of the plot), and Fortune, the result of a card drawn from the Fortune Deck. Many of these cards are based on the &quot;Major Arcana&quot; of tarot divination, such as &quot;The Fool&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;, but the deck includes original cards such as &quot;Drowning in Armor&quot; and &quot;Law&quot;. As with the Tarot deck there is symbolic art and each card has two complementary meanings when upright or reversed (while face up). The meanings are printed on the cards (e.g., &quot;Protective Measures Turn Dangerous&quot; vs. &quot;True Prudence&quot; for &quot;Drowning in Armor&quot;) and explained more fully in the game&#x27;s books. The rules are flexible about how often the GM should consult the Fortune Deck, whether the cards should be shown to players, and how much influence the draw should have—it is entirely acceptable for the GM to never use the deck at all, if she so desires. Though cards sometimes have obvious interpretations for the context in which they are drawn, the rules explain that sometimes they are best read simply as &quot;a positive (or negative) result&quot;.

Although the Fortune Deck resembles (and can be used as) a fortune-telling device, Everway treats the Deck only as a storytelling device and an element of the fictional setting. It does not in any way endorse &quot;real&quot; fortune-telling or other supernatural concepts.

==Reception==
In the December 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 224), Rick Swan was surprised by Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s choice of the very different &quot;Everway&quot; to enter the role-playing game market: &quot;Everway is so far out of the mainstream, it’s barely recognizable as an RPG. For starters, it has no dice. It has no tables or charts. A deck of cards directs the flow of the game. Monster bashing, treasure hunting, dungeon crawling—bye-bye; &quot;Everway&quot; is pure narrative.&quot; Swan liked the &quot;first class&quot; production values of the components, but found the maps &quot;lifeless&quot;. Swan was a big fan of the diceless system, saying, &quot;It makes for a brisk game, and &quot;Everway&quot;, to its credit, plays at blinding speed.&quot; But Swan was concerned by how the game placed an unreasonable onus on the improvisational skills of both the gamemaster and the players. He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath found the cards used to resolve action were too ambiguous, noting, &quot;For example, when characters who are evenly matched in the fire attribute are brawling, the GM draws a card: War, inverted, which indicates &#x27;Effort Misspent&#x27; — but whose? This ambiguity is the main problem with &quot;Everway&quot;. It is gorgeous, ... it is intriguing, and it seems simple to dive into — but it&#x27;s not.&quot;

<text>Eurocard is an IEEE standard format for printed circuit board (PCB) cards that can be plugged together into a standard chassis which, in turn, can be mounted in a 19-inch rack. The chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis.

== Dimensions ==
As the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: A card might be 233.35 mm &quot;high&quot;, but only 20 mm &quot;wide&quot;. Height is measured in rack units, &quot;U&quot;, with 1 U being . This dimension refers to the subrack in which the card is to be mounted, rather than the card itself. 

A single card is 100 mm high. Taller cards add a 133.35 mm, so that a double height card is 233.35 mm high and a triple 366.7 mm high.

Enclosure heights are multiples of 3U, with the cards always shorter than the enclosure. Two common heights are 3U (a 100 mm card in a subrack) and 6U (a 233.35 mm card in a high subrack). As two 3U cards are shorter than a 6U card (by 33.35 mm), it is possible to install two 3U cards in one slot of a 6U subrack, with a mid-height structure for proper support.

Card widths are specified in horizontal pitch units &quot;HP&quot;, with 1 HP being .

Card depths start at and increase in increments. The most common today is , but standard hardware is available for depths of , , , , , and .

== Standards and architecture ==
The Eurocard mechanical architecture was defined originally under IEC-60297-3. Today, the most widely recognized standards for this mechanical structure are IEEE 1101.1, IEEE 1101.10 (also known commonly as &quot;dot ten&quot;) and IEEE 1101.11. IEEE 1101.10 covers the additional mechanical and electromagnetic interference features required for VITA 1.1-1997(R2002), which is the VME64 Extensions standard, as well as PICMG 2.0 (R3.0), which is the CompactPCI specification.

The IEEE 1101.11 standard covers rear plug-in units that are also called rear transition modules or RTMs.

The Eurocard is a mechanical system and does not define the specific connector to be used or the signals that are assigned to connector contacts.

The connector systems that are commonly used with Eurocard architectures include the original DIN 41612 connector that is also standardized as IEC 60603.2. This is the connector that is used for the VMEbus standard, which was IEEE 1014. The connector known as the 5-row DIN, which is used for the VME64 Extensions standard is IEC 61076-4-113. The VME64 Extension architecture defined by VITA 1.1-1997 (R2002).

Another popular computer architecture that utilizes the 6U-160 Eurocard is CompactPCI and CompactPCI Express. These are defined by PICMG 2.0R3 and PICMG Exp0 R1 respectively. Other computer architectures that utilize the Eurocard system are VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI), PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), and PXI Express.

A computer architecture that used the 6U-220 Eurocard format was Multibus-II, which was IEEE 1296.

Because the Eurocard system provided for so many modular card sizes and because connector manufacturers have continued to create new connectors that are compatible with this system, it is a popular mechanical standard that is also used for innumerable &quot;one-off&quot; applications.

Conduction-cooled Eurocards are used in military and aerospace applications. They are defined by the IEEE 1101.2-1992 (2001) standard.

The Eurocard standard is also the basis of the &quot;Eurorack&quot; format for modular electronic music synthesizers, popularized by Doepfer and other manufacturers.

<doc id="9890" wikidata="Q5358168" url="?curid=9890" title="Electron counting">
<text>In chemistry, electron counting is a formalism for assigning a number of valence electrons to individual atoms in a molecule. It is used for classifying compounds and for explaining or predicting their electronic structure and bonding. Many rules in chemistry rely on electron-counting:

*Octet rule is used with Lewis structures for main group elements, especially the lighter ones such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen,
*18-electron rule in inorganic chemistry and organometallic chemistry of transition metals,
*Hückel&#x27;s rule for the π-electrons of aromatic compounds,
*Polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory for polyhedral cluster compounds, including transition metals and main group elements and mixtures thereof, such as boranes.

Atoms are called &quot;electron-deficient&quot; when they have too few electrons as compared to their respective rules, or &quot;hypervalent&quot; when they have too many electrons. Since these compounds tend to be more reactive than compounds that obey their rule, electron counting is an important tool for identifying the reactivity of molecules. While the counting formalism considers each atom separately, these individual atoms (with their hypothetical assigned charge) do not generally exist as free species.

==Counting rules==

Two methods of electron counting are &quot;neutral counting&quot; and &quot;ionic counting&quot;. Both approaches give the same result (and can therefore be used to verify one&#x27;s calculation). 
*The neutral counting approach assumes the molecule or fragment being studied consists of purely covalent bonds. It was popularized by Malcolm Green along with the L and X ligand notation. It is usually considered easier especially for low-valent transition metals.

*The &quot;ionic counting&quot; approach assumes purely ionic bonds between atoms.

It is important, though, to be aware that most chemical species exist between the purely covalent and ionic extremes.

===Neutral counting===

* Neutral counting assumes each bond is equally split between two atoms.
* This method begins with locating the central atom on the periodic table and determining the number of its valence electrons. One counts valence electrons for main group elements differently from transition metals, which use d electron count.
:E.g. in period 2: B, C, N, O, and F have 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 valence electrons, respectively.
:E.g. in period 4: K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 valence electrons respectively.
* One is added for every halide or other anionic ligand which binds to the central atom through a sigma bond.
* Two is added for every lone pair bonding to the metal (e.g. each Lewis base binds with a lone pair). Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as alkenes and alkynes are considered Lewis bases. Similarly Lewis and Bronsted acids (protons) contribute nothing.
* One is added for each homoelement bond.
* One is added for each negative charge, and one is subtracted for each positive charge.

===Ionic counting===

* Ionic counting assumes unequal sharing of electrons in the bond. The more electronegative atom in the bond gains electron lost from the less electronegative atom.
* This method begins by calculating the number of electrons of the element, assuming an oxidation state.
:E.g. for a Fe2+ has 6 electrons
:S2− has 8 electrons
* Two is added for every halide or other anionic ligand which binds to the metal through a sigma bond.
* Two is added for every lone pair bonding to the metal (e.g. each phosphine ligand can bind with a lone pair). Similarly Lewis and Bronsted acids (protons) contribute nothing.
* For unsaturated ligands such as alkenes, one electron is added for each carbon atom binding to the metal.

==Electrons donated by common fragments==
===&quot;Special cases&quot;===
The numbers of electrons &quot;donated&quot; by some ligands depends on the geometry of the metal-ligand ensemble. An example of this complication is the M–NO entity. When this grouping is linear, the NO ligand is considered to be a three-electron ligand. When the M–NO subunit is strongly bent at N, the NO is treated as a pseudohalide and is thus a one electron (in the neutral counting approach). The situation is not very different from the &quot;η&quot;3 versus the &quot;η&quot;1 allyl. Another unusual ligand from the electron counting perspective is sulfur dioxide. 
==Examples==

* H2O

For a water molecule (H2O), using both neutral counting and ionic counting result in a total of 8 electrons.
The neutral counting method assumes each OH bond is split equally (each atom gets one electron from the bond). Thus both hydrogen atoms have an electron count of one. The oxygen atom has 6 valence electrons. The total electron count is 8, which agrees with the octet rule.
With the ionic counting method, the more electronegative oxygen will gain electrons donated by the two hydrogen atoms in the two OH bonds to become O2-. It now has 8 total valence electrons, which obeys the octet rule.

*CH4, for the central C
:neutral counting: C contributes 4 electrons, each H radical contributes one each: 4 + 4 × 1 = 8 valence electrons
:ionic counting: C4− contributes 8 electrons, each proton contributes 0 each: 8 + 4 × 0 = 8 electrons.
:Similar for H:
:neutral counting: H contributes 1 electron, the C contributes 1 electron (the other 3 electrons of C are for the other 3 hydrogens in the molecule): 1 + 1 × 1 = 2 valence electrons.
:ionic counting: H contributes 0 electrons (H+), C4− contributes 2 electrons (per H), 0 + 1 × 2 = 2 valence electrons
:conclusion: Methane follows the octet-rule for carbon, and the duet rule for hydrogen, and hence is expected to be a stable molecule (as we see from daily life)

*H2S, for the central S
:neutral counting: S contributes 6 electrons, each hydrogen radical contributes one each: 6 + 2 × 1 = 8 valence electrons
:ionic counting: S2− contributes 8 electrons, each proton contributes 0: 8 + 2 × 0 = 8 valence electrons
:conclusion: with an octet electron count (on sulfur), we can anticipate that H2S would be pseudo-tetrahedral if one considers the two lone pairs.

*SCl2, for the central S
:neutral counting: S contributes 6 electrons, each chlorine radical contributes one each: 6 + 2 × 1 = 8 valence electrons
:ionic counting: S2+ contributes 4 electrons, each chloride anion contributes 2: 4 + 2 × 2 = 8 valence electrons
:conclusion: see discussion for H2S above. Both SCl2 and H2S follow the octet rule - the behavior of these molecules is however quite different.

*SF6, for the central S
:neutral counting: S contributes 6 electrons, each fluorine radical contributes one each: 6 + 6 × 1 = 12 valence electrons
:ionic counting: S6+ contributes 0 electrons, each fluoride anion contributes 2: 0 + 6 × 2 = 12 valence electrons
:conclusion: ionic counting indicates a molecule lacking lone pairs of electrons, therefore its structure will be octahedral, as predicted by VSEPR. One might conclude that this molecule would be highly reactive - but the opposite is true: SF6 is inert, and it is widely used in industry because of this property.

* RuCl2(bpy)2
RuCl2(bpy)2 is an octahedral metal complex with two bidentate 2,2′-Bipyridine (bpy) ligands and two chloride ligands.

In the neutral counting method, the Ruthenium of the complex is treated as Ru(0). It has 8 d electrons to contribute to the electron count. The two bpy ligands are L-type ligand neutral ligands, thus contributing two electrons each. The two chloride ligands hallides and thus 1 electron donors, donating 1 electron each to the electron count. The total electron count of RuCl2(bpy)2 is 18.

In the ionic counting method, the Ruthenium of the complex is treated as Ru(II). It has 6 d electrons to contribute to the electron count. The two bpy ligands are L-type ligand neutral ligands, thus contributing two electrons each. The two chloride ligands are anionic ligands, thus donating 2 electrons each to the electron count. The total electron count of RuCl2(bpy)2 is 18, agreeing with the result of neural counting.

* TiCl4, for the central Ti
:neutral counting: Ti contributes 4 electrons, each chlorine radical contributes one each: 4 + 4 × 1 = 8 valence electrons
:ionic counting: Ti4+ contributes 0 electrons, each chloride anion contributes two each: 0 + 4 × 2 = 8 valence electrons
:conclusion: Having only 8e (vs. 18 possible), we can anticipate that TiCl4 will be a good Lewis acid. Indeed, it reacts (in some cases violently) with water, alcohols, ethers, amines.

* Fe(CO)5
:neutral counting: Fe contributes 8 electrons, each CO contributes 2 each: 8 + 2 × 5 = 18 valence electrons
:ionic counting: Fe(0) contributes 8 electrons, each CO contributes 2 each: 8 + 2 × 5 = 18 valence electrons
:conclusions: this is a special case, where ionic counting is the same as neutral counting, all fragments being neutral. Since this is an 18-electron complex, it is expected to be isolable compound.

* Ferrocene, (C5H5)2Fe, for the central Fe:
:neutral counting: Fe contributes 8 electrons, the 2 cyclopentadienyl-rings contribute 5 each: 8 + 2 × 5 = 18 electrons
:ionic counting: Fe2+ contributes 6 electrons, the two aromatic cyclopentadienyl rings contribute 6 each: 6 + 2 × 6 = 18 valence electrons on iron.
:conclusion: Ferrocene is expected to be an isolable compound.

<doc id="9891" wikidata="Q45003" url="?curid=9891" title="Entropy">
<text>Entropy is a scientific concept, most commonly associated with states of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics—where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.

Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time. As a result, isolated systems evolve toward thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. A consequence of the second law of thermodynamics is that certain processes are irreversible.

The thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names &quot;thermodynamic function&quot; and &quot;heat-potential&quot;. In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as &quot;transformation-content&quot;, in German &quot;Verwandlungsinhalt&quot;, and later coined the term &quot;entropy&quot; from a Greek word for &quot;transformation&quot;.

Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behaviour, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, which has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units.

== History ==

In his 1803 paper &quot;Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement&quot;, the French mathematician Lazare Carnot proposed that in any machine, the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of &quot;moment of activity&quot;; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. In 1824, building on that work, Lazare&#x27;s son, Sadi Carnot, published &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever &quot;caloric&quot; (what is now known as heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a water wheel. That was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th-century &quot;Newtonian hypothesis&quot; that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford, who showed in 1789 that heat could be created by friction, as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state at the end of a complete engine cycle, &quot;no change occurs in the condition of the working body&quot;.

The first law of thermodynamics, deduced from the heat-friction experiments of James Joule in 1843, expresses the concept of energy and its conservation in all processes; the first law, however, is unsuitable to separately quantify the effects of friction and dissipation.

In the 1850s and 1860s, German physicist Rudolf Clausius objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body, and gave that change a mathematical interpretation, by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done, e.g., heat produced by friction. He described his observations as a dissipative use of energy, resulting in a &quot;transformation-content&quot; ( in German), of a thermodynamic system or working body of chemical species during a change of state. That was in contrast to earlier views, based on the theories of Isaac Newton, that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass. Clausius discovered that the non-usable energy increases as steam proceeds from inlet to exhaust in a steam engine. From the prefix &quot;en-&quot;, as in &#x27;energy&#x27;, and from the Greek word [tropē], which is translated in an established lexicon as &quot;turning&quot; or &quot;change&quot; and that he rendered in German as , a word often translated into English as &quot;transformation&quot;, in 1865 Clausius coined the name of that property as &quot;entropy&quot;. The word was adopted into the English language in 1868.

Later, scientists such as Ludwig Boltzmann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and James Clerk Maxwell gave entropy a statistical basis. In 1877, Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. The proportionality constant in this definition, called the Boltzmann constant, has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI). Henceforth, the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy &quot;E&quot; over &quot;N&quot; identical systems. Constantin Carathéodory, a Greek mathematician, linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.

== Etymology ==
In 1865, Clausius named the concept of &quot;the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system&quot;, &quot;&quot; () after the Greek word for &#x27;transformation&#x27;. He gave &quot;transformational content&quot; () as a synonym, paralleling his &quot;thermal and ergonal content&quot; () as the name of &quot;U&quot;, but preferring the term &quot;entropy&quot; as a close parallel of the word &quot;energy&quot;, as he found the concepts nearly &quot;analogous in their physical significance&quot;. This term was formed by replacing the root of (&#x27;ergon&#x27;, &#x27;work&#x27;) by that of (&#x27;tropy&#x27;, &#x27;transformation&#x27;).

In more detail, Clausius explained his choice of &quot;entropy&quot; as a name as follows:

I prefer going to the ancient languages for the names of important scientific quantities, so that they may mean the same thing in all living tongues. I propose, therefore, to call &quot;S&quot; the &quot;entropy&quot; of a body, after the Greek word &quot;transformation&quot;. I have designedly coined the word &quot;entropy&quot; to be similar to energy, for these two quantities are so analogous in their physical significance, that an analogy of denominations seems to me helpful.

Leon Cooper added that in this way &quot;he succeeded in coining a word that meant the same thing to everybody: nothing&quot;.

== Definitions and descriptions ==
The concept of entropy is described by two principal approaches, the macroscopic perspective of classical thermodynamics, and the microscopic description central to statistical mechanics. The classical approach defines entropy in terms of macroscopically measurable physical properties, such as bulk mass, volume, pressure, and temperature. The statistical definition of entropy defines it in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modelled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). The two approaches form a consistent, unified view of the same phenomenon as expressed in the second law of thermodynamics, which has found universal applicability to physical processes.

=== State variables and functions of state ===
Many thermodynamic properties are defined by physical variables that define a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, which essentially are state variables. State variables depend only on the equilibrium condition, not on the path evolution to that state. State variables can be functions of state, also called state functions, in a sense that one state variable is a mathematical function of other state variables. Often, if some properties of a system are determined, they are sufficient to determine the state of the system and thus other properties&#x27; values. For example, temperature and pressure of a given quantity of gas determine its state, and thus also its volume via the ideal gas law. A system composed of a pure substance of a single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined, and is thus a particular state, and has a particular volume. The fact that entropy is a function of state makes it useful. In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state that it had at the start of the cycle, hence the change or line integral of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.

=== Reversible process ===
The entropy change &quot;formula_1&quot; of a system excluding its surroundings can be well-defined as a small portion of heat &quot;formula_2&quot; transferred to the system during reversible process divided by the temperature &quot;formula_3&quot; of the system during this heat transfer:formula_4The reversible process is quasistatic (i.e., it occurs without any dissipation, deviating only infinitesimally from the thermodynamic equilibrium), and it may conserve total entropy. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir represents the increase in the entropy in a cold reservoir, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored, represents the decrease in the entropy which could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse, returning to the initial state; thus the total entropy change may still be zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

In contrast, irreversible process increases the total entropy of the system and surroundings. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from the thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible, the total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done during the process is lost.

=== Carnot cycle ===
The concept of entropy arose from Rudolf Clausius&#x27;s study of the Carnot cycle which is a thermodynamic cycle performed by a Carnot heat engine as a reversible heat engine. In a Carnot cycle, the heat formula_5 is transferred from a hot reservoir to a working gas at the constant temperature formula_6 during isothermal expansion stage and the heat formula_7 is transferred from a working gas to a cold reservoir at the constant temperature formula_8 during isothermal compression stage. According to Carnot&#x27;s theorem, a heat engine with two thermal reservoirs can produce a work formula_9 if and only if there is a temperature difference between reservoirs. Originally, Carnot did not distinguish between heats formula_5 and formula_7, as he assumed caloric theory to be valid and hence that the total heat in the system was conserved. But in fact, the magnitude of heat formula_5 is greater than the magnitude of heat formula_7. Through the efforts of Clausius and Kelvin, the work formula_9 done by a reversible heat engine was found to be the product of the Carnot efficiency (i.e., the efficiency of all reversible heat engines with the same pair of thermal reservoirs) and the heat formula_5 absorbed by a working body of the engine during isothermal expansion:formula_16To derive the Carnot efficiency Kelvin had to evaluate the ratio of the work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion with the help of the Carnot–Clapeyron equation, which contained an unknown function called the Carnot function. The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero point of temperature was suggested by Joule in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.

It is known that a work formula_17 produced by an engine over a cycle equals to a net heat formula_18 absorbed over a cycle. Thus, with the sign convention for a heat formula_19 transferred in a thermodynamic process (formula_20 for an absorption and formula_21 for a dissipation) we get:formula_22Since this equality holds over an entire Carnot cycle, it gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle the difference between a work and a net heat would be conserved, rather than a net heat itself. Which means there exists a state function formula_23 with a change of formula_24. It is called an internal energy and forms a central concept for the first law of thermodynamics.

Finally, comparison for both the representations of a work output in a Carnot cycle gives us:formula_25Similarly to the derivation of internal energy, this equality implies existence of a state function formula_26 with a change of formula_27 and which is conserved over an entire cycle. Clausius called this state function &quot;entropy&quot;.

In addition, the total change of entropy in both thermal reservoirs over Carnot cycle is zero too, since the inversion of a heat transfer direction means a sign inversion for the heat transferred during isothermal stages:formula_28Here we denote the entropy change for a thermal reservoir by formula_29, where formula_30 is either formula_31 for a hot reservoir or formula_32 for a cold one.

If we consider a heat engine which is less effective than Carnot cycle (i.e., the work formula_33 produced by this engine is less than the maximum predicted by Carnot&#x27;s theorem), its work output is capped by Carnot efficiency as:formula_34Substitution of the work formula_9 as the net heat into the inequality above gives us:formula_36or in terms of the entropy change formula_37:formula_38A Carnot cycle and an entropy as shown above prove to be useful in the study of any classical thermodynamic heat engine: other cycles, such as an Otto, Diesel or Brayton cycle, could be analysed from the same standpoint. Notably, any machine or cyclic process converting heat into work (i.e., heat engine) that is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the one of Carnot is not viable — due to violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

For further analysis of sufficiently discrete systems, such as an assembly of particles, statistical thermodynamics must be used. Additionally, descriptions of devices operating near the limit of de Broglie waves, e.g. photovoltaic cells, have to be consistent with quantum statistics.

=== Classical thermodynamics ===


The thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer in the isotherm steps (isothermal expansion and isothermal compression) of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in an increment of entropy that is equal to incremental heat transfer divided by temperature. Entropy was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually returned to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.

While Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that energy may &quot;not&quot; flow to and from an isolated system, but energy flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.

According to the Clausius equality, for a reversible cyclic thermodynamic process: formula_39which means the line integral formula_40 is path-independent. Thus we can define a state function formula_26, called &quot;entropy&quot;:formula_4Therefore, thermodynamic entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit joule per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).

To find the entropy difference between any two states of the system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states. Since an entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states. However, the heat transferred to or from the surroundings is different as well as its entropy change.

We can calculate the change of entropy only by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we consider the third law of thermodynamics: perfect crystals at the absolute zero have an entropy formula_43.

From a macroscopic perspective, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process, where the system gives up formula_44 of energy to the surrounding at the temperature formula_3, its entropy falls by formula_46 and at least formula_47 of that energy must be given up to the system&#x27;s surroundings as a heat. Otherwise, this process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined if and only if it is in a thermodynamic equilibrium (though a chemical equilibrium is not required: for example, the entropy of a mixture of two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen in standard conditions is well-defined).

=== Statistical mechanics ===

The statistical definition was developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1870s by analysing the statistical behaviour of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor—known as the Boltzmann constant. In short, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental verification of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.

The interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, disorder, or &quot;mixedupness&quot; in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and momentum of every molecule. The more such states are available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of &quot;disorder&quot; (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) that could cause the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.

The Boltzmann constant, and therefore entropy, have dimensions of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J⋅K−1) in the International System of Units (or kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1 in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an intensive property — either entropy per unit mass (SI unit: J⋅K−1⋅kg−1) or entropy per unit amount of substance (SI unit: J⋅K−1⋅mol−1).

Specifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure for the system with a number of states, each with a probability formula_48 of being occupied (usually given by the Boltzmann distribution):formula_49where formula_50 is the Boltzmann constant and the summation is performed over all possible microstates of the system.

In case states are defined in a continuous manner, the summation is replaced by an integral over all possible states, or equivalently we can consider the expected value of the logarithm of the probability that a microstate is occupied:formula_51This definition assumes the basis states to be picked in a way that there is no information on their relative phases. In a general case the expression is:formula_52where formula_53 is a density matrix, formula_54 is a trace operator and formula_55 is a matrix logarithm. Density matrix formalism is not required if the system occurs to be in a thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be eigenstates of Hamiltonian. For most practical purposes it can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulae for formula_26 can be derived from it, but not vice versa.

In what has been called &quot;the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics&quot;, among system microstates of the same energy (i.e., degenerate microstates) each microstate is assumed to be populated with equal probability formula_57, where formula_58 is the number of microstates whose energy equals to the one of the system. Usually, this assumption is justified for an isolated system in a thermodynamic equilibrium. Then in case of an isolated system the previous formula reduces to:formula_59In thermodynamics, such a system is one with a fixed volume, number of molecules, and internal energy, called a microcanonical ensemble.

The most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of the extent of uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because it does not reflect all information about the initial conditions, except for the conserved variables. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.

The interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier &quot;for a given set of macroscopic variables&quot; above has deep implications when two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables. For example, consider observer A using variables formula_23, formula_61, formula_9 and observer B using variables formula_23, formula_61, formula_9, formula_66. If observer B changes variable formula_66, then observer A will see a violation of the second law of thermodynamics, since he does not possess information about variable formula_66 and its influence on the system. In other words, one must choose a complete set of macroscopic variables to describe the system, i.e. every independent parameter that may change during experiment.

Entropy can also be defined for any Markov processes with reversible dynamics and the detailed balance property.

In Boltzmann&#x27;s 1896 &quot;Lectures on Gas Theory&quot;, he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.

=== Entropy of a system ===


Entropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.

In a thermodynamic system, pressure and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.

As an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between the warm room (the surroundings) and the cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room) decreases as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water, of which the entropy has increased.

However, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the &quot;universe&quot; of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalisation has progressed.

Thermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits &quot;perpetual motion&quot; machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in the total entropy of system and surroundings correspond to irreversible changes, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.

Unlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Absolute standard molar entropy of a substance can be calculated from the measured temperature dependence of its heat capacity. The molar entropy of ions is obtained as a difference in entropy from a reference state defined as zero entropy. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system must increase or remain constant. Therefore, entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and system entropy, in conjunction with enthalpy, plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.

One dictionary definition of entropy is that it is &quot;a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work&quot; in a cyclic process. For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.

A special case of entropy increase, the entropy of mixing, occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work – the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances. At a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing.

=== Equivalence of definitions ===
Proofs of equivalence between the entropy in statistical mechanics — the Gibbs entropy formula:formula_49and the entropy in classical thermodynamics:formula_4together with the fundamental thermodynamic relation are known for the microcanonical ensemble, the canonical ensemble, the grand canonical ensemble, and the isothermal–isobaric ensemble. These proofs are based on the probability density of microstates of the generalised Boltzmann distribution and the identification of the thermodynamic internal energy as the ensemble average formula_71. Thermodynamic relations are then employed to derive the well-known Gibbs entropy formula. However, the equivalence between the Gibbs entropy formula and the thermodynamic definition of entropy is not a fundamental thermodynamic relation but rather a consequence of the form of the generalized Boltzmann distribution.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the definitions of entropy in statistical mechanics is the only entropy that is equivalent to the classical thermodynamics entropy under the following postulates:
== Second law of thermodynamics ==
The second law of thermodynamics requires that, in general, the total entropy of any system does not decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat cannot flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. As a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual motion machine. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.

It follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.

In mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the fundamental thermodynamic relation places limits on a system&#x27;s ability to do useful work. The entropy change of a system at temperature formula_3 absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat formula_73 in a reversible way, is given by formula_74. More explicitly, an energy formula_75 is not available to do useful work, where formula_76 is the temperature of the coldest accessible reservoir or heat sink external to the system. For further discussion, see &quot;Exergy&quot;.

Statistical mechanics demonstrates that entropy is governed by probability, thus allowing for a decrease in disorder even in an isolated system. Although this is possible, such an event has a small probability of occurring, making it unlikely.

The applicability of a second law of thermodynamics is limited to systems in or sufficiently near equilibrium state, so that they have defined entropy. Some inhomogeneous systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium still satisfy the hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium, so that entropy density is locally defined as an intensive quantity. For such systems, there may apply a principle of maximum time rate of entropy production. It states that such a system may evolve to a steady state that maximises its time rate of entropy production. This does not mean that such a system is necessarily always in a condition of maximum time rate of entropy production; it means that it may evolve to such a steady state.

== Applications ==
=== The fundamental thermodynamic relation ===

The entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters, such as its volume. In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy formula_23 to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the &quot;fundamental thermodynamic relation&quot;. If external pressure formula_78 bears on the volume formula_61 as the only external parameter, this relation is:formula_80Since both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature formula_3, implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the whole-system entropy, pressure, and temperature may not exist).

The fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the Maxwell relations and the relations between heat capacities.

=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===
Thermodynamic entropy is central in chemical thermodynamics, enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system — the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings — increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation introduces the measurement of entropy change which describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems — always from hotter body to cooler one spontaneously.

Thermodynamic entropy is an extensive property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an intensive property independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the kilogram (unit: J⋅kg−1⋅K−1). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one mole of substance, in which case it is called the &quot;molar entropy&quot; with a unit of J⋅mol−1⋅K−1.

Thus, when one mole of substance at about is warmed by its surroundings to , the sum of the incremental values of formula_82 constitute each element&#x27;s or compound&#x27;s standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at . Entropy change also measures the mixing of substances as a summation of their relative quantities in the final mixture.

Entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. For such applications, formula_46 must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings: formula_84Via additional steps this expression becomes the equation of Gibbs free energy change formula_85 for reactants and products in the system at the constant pressure and temperature formula_3:formula_87where formula_88 is the enthalpy change and formula_46 is the entropy change.

=== World&#x27;s technological capacity to store and communicate entropic information ===

A 2011 study in &quot;Science&quot; estimated the world&#x27;s technological capacity to store and communicate optimally compressed information normalised on the most effective compression algorithms available in the year 2007, therefore estimating the entropy of the technologically available sources. The author&#x27;s estimate that human kind&#x27;s technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 1986 to 295 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 2007. The world&#x27;s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (entropically compressed) information in 1986, to 1.9 zettabytes in 2007. The world&#x27;s effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of (entropically compressed) information in 1986, to 65 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 2007.

=== Entropy balance equation for open systems ===

In chemical engineering, the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to &quot;open systems&quot;, i.e. those in which heat, work, and mass flow across the system boundary. In general, flow of heat formula_90, flow of shaft work formula_91 and pressure-volume work formula_92 across the system boundaries cause changes in the entropy of the system. Heat transfer entails entropy transfer formula_93, where formula_3 is the absolute thermodynamic temperature of the system at the point of the heat flow. If there are mass flows across the system boundaries, they also influence the total entropy of the system. This account, in terms of heat and work, is valid only for cases in which the work and heat transfers are by paths physically distinct from the paths of entry and exit of matter from the system.

To derive a generalised entropy balanced equation, we start with the general balance equation for the change in any extensive quantity formula_95 in a thermodynamic system, a quantity that may be either conserved, such as energy, or non-conserved, such as entropy. The basic generic balance expression states that formula_96, i.e. the rate of change of formula_95 in the system, equals the rate at which formula_95 enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which formula_95 leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which formula_95 is generated within the system. For an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter, using this generic balance equation, with respect to the rate of change with time formula_101 of the extensive quantity entropy formula_26, the entropy balance equation is:formula_103where formula_104 is the net rate of entropy flow due to the flows of mass formula_105 into and out of the system with entropy per unit mass formula_106, formula_107 is the rate of entropy flow due to the flow of heat across the system boundary and formula_108 is the rate of entropy generation within the system, e.g. by chemical reactions, phase transitions, internal heat transfer or frictional effects such as viscosity.

In case of multiple heat flows the term formula_93 is replaced by formula_110, where formula_111 is the heat flow through formula_112-th port into the system and formula_113 is the temperature at the formula_112-th port.

The nomenclature &quot;entropy balance&quot; is misleading and often deemed inappropriate because entropy is not a conserved quantity. In other words, the term formula_108 is never a known quantity but always a derived one based on the expression above. Therefore, the open system version of the second law is more appropriately described as the &quot;entropy generation equation&quot; since it specifies that:formula_116with zero for reversible process and positive values for irreversible one.

== Entropy change formulas for simple processes ==
For certain simple transformations in systems of constant composition, the entropy changes are given by simple formulas.

=== Isothermal expansion or compression of an ideal gas ===
For the expansion (or compression) of an ideal gas from an initial volume formula_117 and pressure formula_118 to a final volume formula_61 and pressure formula_120 at any constant temperature, the change in entropy is given by:formula_121Here formula_122 is the amount of gas (in moles) and formula_123 is the ideal gas constant. These equations also apply for expansion into a finite vacuum or a throttling process, where the temperature, internal energy and enthalpy for an ideal gas remain constant.

=== Cooling and heating ===
For pure heating or cooling of any system (gas, liquid or solid) at constant pressure from an initial temperature formula_124 to a final temperature formula_3, the entropy change is:
:formula_126
provided that the constant-pressure molar heat capacity (or specific heat) formula_127 is constant and that no phase transition occurs in this temperature interval.

Similarly at constant volume, the entropy change is:formula_128where the constant-volume molar heat capacity formula_129 is constant and there is no phase change.

At low temperatures near absolute zero, heat capacities of solids quickly drop off to near zero, so the assumption of constant heat capacity does not apply.

Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of any process in which temperature and volume both vary is the same as for a path divided into two steps – heating at constant volume and expansion at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, the total entropy change is:formula_130Similarly if the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas both vary:formula_131

=== Phase transitions ===
Reversible phase transitions occur at constant temperature and pressure. The reversible heat is the enthalpy change for the transition, and the entropy change is the enthalpy change divided by the thermodynamic temperature. For fusion (i.e., melting) of a solid to a liquid at the melting point formula_132, the entropy of fusion is:formula_133Similarly, for vaporisation of a liquid to a gas at the boiling point formula_134, the entropy of vaporisation is:formula_135

== Approaches to understanding entropy ==
As a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics and physics, several different approaches to entropy beyond that of Clausius and Boltzmann are valid.

=== Standard textbook definitions ===
The following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:
* a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.
* a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.
* a measure of a system&#x27;s thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.

In Boltzmann&#x27;s analysis in terms of constituent particles, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.

=== Order and disorder ===

Entropy is often loosely associated with the amount of or disorder, or of chaos, in a thermodynamic system. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the state of the system and is a measure of &quot;molecular disorder&quot; and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another. In this direction, several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies. One of the simpler entropy order/disorder formulas is that derived in 1984 by thermodynamic physicist Peter Landsberg, based on a combination of thermodynamics and information theory arguments. He argues that when constraints operate on a system, such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states, as contrasted with its forbidden states, the measure of the total amount of &quot;disorder&quot; and &quot;order&quot; in the system are each given by:

formula_136formula_137

Here, formula_138 is the &quot;disorder&quot; capacity of the system, which is the entropy of the parts contained in the permitted ensemble, formula_139 is the &quot;information&quot; capacity of the system, an expression similar to Shannon&#x27;s channel capacity, and formula_140 is the &quot;order&quot; capacity of the system.

=== Energy dispersal ===
The concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature. Similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics, and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory, entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or &quot;spreading&quot; of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantised energy levels.

Ambiguities in the terms &quot;disorder&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;, which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students. As the second law of thermodynamics shows, in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist Peter Atkins, in his textbook &quot;Physical Chemistry&quot;, introduces entropy with the statement that &quot;spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy or matter and often both&quot;.

=== Relating entropy to energy &quot;usefulness&quot; ===
It is possible (in a thermal context) to regard lower entropy as a measure of the &quot;effectiveness&quot; or &quot;usefulness&quot; of a particular quantity of energy. Energy supplied at a higher temperature (i.e. with low entropy) tends to be more useful than the same amount of energy available at a lower temperature. Mixing a hot parcel of a fluid with a cold one produces a parcel of intermediate temperature, in which the overall increase in entropy represents a &quot;loss&quot; that can never be replaced.

As the entropy of the universe is steadily increasing, its total energy is becoming less useful. Eventually, this is theorised to lead to the heat death of the universe.

=== Entropy and adiabatic accessibility ===
A definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by E. H. Lieb and J. Yngvason in 1999. This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of Constantin Carathéodory from 1909 and the monograph by R. Giles. In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason, one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states formula_141 and formula_142 such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not conversely. Defining the entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively, the entropy of a state formula_66 is defined as the largest number formula_144 such that formula_66 is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount formula_144 in the state formula_142 and a complementary amount, formula_148, in the state formula_141. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: it is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.

=== Entropy in quantum mechanics ===
In quantum statistical mechanics, the concept of entropy was developed by John von Neumann and is generally referred to as &quot;von Neumann entropy&quot;:formula_52where formula_53 is the density matrix, formula_152 is the trace operator and formula_50 is the Boltzmann constant.

This upholds the correspondence principle, because in the classical limit, when the phases between the basis states are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy for states with classical probabilities formula_48:formula_49i.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.

Von Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work . He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the density matrix he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.

=== Information theory ===


When viewed in terms of information theory, the entropy state function is the amount of information in the system that is needed to fully specify the microstate of the system. Entropy is the measure of the amount of missing information before reception. Often called &quot;Shannon entropy&quot;, it was originally devised by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the size of information of a transmitted message. The definition of information entropy is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities formula_48 so that:formula_157where the base of the logarithm determines the units (for example, the binary logarithm corresponds to bits).

In the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average size of information of a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of binary questions needed to determine the content of the message.

Most researchers consider information entropy and thermodynamic entropy directly linked to the same concept, while others argue that they are distinct. Both expressions are mathematically similar. If formula_9 is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same &quot;a priori&quot; probability, then that probability is formula_159. The Shannon entropy (in nats) is:formula_160and if entropy is measured in units of formula_161 per nat, then the entropy is given by:formula_162which is the Boltzmann entropy formula, where formula_161 is the Boltzmann constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat. Some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the formula_164 function of information theory and using Shannon&#x27;s other term, &quot;uncertainty&quot;, instead.

=== Measurement ===
The entropy of a substance can be measured, although in an indirect way. The measurement, known as entropymetry, is done on a closed system with constant number of particles formula_165 and constant volume formula_61, and it uses the definition of temperature in terms of entropy, while limiting energy exchange to heat formula_167:formula_168The resulting relation describes how entropy changes formula_1 when a small amount of energy formula_170 is introduced into the system at a certain temperature formula_3.

The process of measurement goes as follows. First, a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible. At such temperatures, the entropy approaches zerodue to the definition of temperature. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25 °C). The obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.

== Interdisciplinary applications ==
Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic concept, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including information theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics/ecological economics, and evolution.

=== Philosophy and theoretical physics ===
Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions. Since the 19th century, a number the philosophers have drawn upon the concept of entropy to develop novel metaphysical and ethical systems. Examples of this work can be found in the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche and Philipp Mainländer, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Isabelle Stengers, Shannon Mussett, and Drew M. Dalton. 

=== Biology ===
Chiavazzo &quot;et al.&quot; proposed that where cave spiders choose to lay their eggs can be explained through entropy minimisation.

Entropy has been proven useful in the analysis of base pair sequences in DNA. Many entropy-based measures have been shown to distinguish between different structural regions of the genome, differentiate between coding and non-coding regions of DNA, and can also be applied for the recreation of evolutionary trees by determining the evolutionary distance between different species.

=== Cosmology ===
Assuming that a finite universe is an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.

If the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then – as Roger Penrose has pointed out – gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole&#x27;s event horizon. Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. This makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. However, the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity (see Hawking radiation).

The role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of Ludwig Boltzmann. Recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. Although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer. This results in an &quot;entropy gap&quot; pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium. Other complicating factors, such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects, are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models, making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.

Current theories suggest the entropy gap to have been originally opened up by the early rapid exponential expansion of the universe.

=== Economics ===
Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on &quot;The Entropy Law and the Economic Process&quot;. Due to Georgescu-Roegen&#x27;s work, the laws of thermodynamics form an integral part of the ecological economics school. Although his work was blemished somewhat by mistakes, a full chapter on the economics of Georgescu-Roegen has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics.

In economics, Georgescu-Roegen&#x27;s work has generated the term &#x27;entropy pessimism&#x27;. Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly – a student of Georgescu-Roegen – has been the economics profession&#x27;s most influential proponent of the entropy pessimism position.
